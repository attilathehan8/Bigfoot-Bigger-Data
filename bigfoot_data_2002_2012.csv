"Well last year I was night fishing 9/2010 at Amawalk Reservior SOMERS NY about 30 minutes from PAWLINGS I was fishing with my buddy..the reservior was about 100ft into the lake before you got to water .....about 5am sun was coming out..when a 5 foot maybe 5 1/2 ft man  or Big Foot came out of the woods washed its face and drank some of the reservoir water..he looked like something out of the old school ""Planets of the Apes"" chimps..I said to my buddy ""you see that?""?he said yes ..Now on Animal Planet there showing a clip of a Big Foot that has been seen in these areas (Lower Hudson Valley)..So I'm puzzled to think what I saw was a Big Foot....so this my account of what I saw..and we didn't catch crap at night..anybody ever run into anything like this??... This was my post on www.westchesterfishing.com Low and be hold another member at the same reservior..Columbus day 2011..this is his post..Hey Guys, I put at Amawalk this summer and about the 5th time I took it out in early October.  I saw two upright walking chimp looking things walk out of the woods and crouch down and drink from the res, run back in to the woods and then do the same thing again.  When they came out the second time one of them threw it's arms in the air while squatting and then they ran back into the woods.   The second one went back slowly.  It seemed like they saw something in the water right in front of them.  That was right when the sun came up.  I haven't been back to my boat since.  I have no idea what they were and looked like two large chimps to me.  Maybe some guy who lives there has two monkeys or something?  I have no idea.  But I saw something that I can't explain, it has been eating away at me since.  When I saw the preview for that show I almost shat myself.  When Biggame posted here I didn't want to say that I saw something because I'm from Oregon and my hunting and logging part of the family thinks they know where they live but none of them have never ever seen them just have stories, just like everyone else in Oregon.  Then I saw what I saw in October and have been denying it to myself ever since.  I absolutely hope that someone owns two monkey's on the Amawalk. I have no reason to say something like this.  Before October I could have cared less if bigfoot existed, now I'm a bit curious.  I own a fishing rod company and have business to lose from people thinking I'm crazy for posting this on here.  This is a nothing to gain and allot to lose situation for me but, I had to say something when Biggame posted.  Let me be clear in saying that I saw something too.  I have no idea what they were and would need absolute proof that bigfoot existed before I would ever say thats what they were. So two seperate sightings same place different year..I BELIEVE!!!",Both sightings were on the North east corner of the reservoir..the lake was low..I saw it walk and stick its face in the water like a dog,Westchester County,New York,Fall,Report 31940: Fishermen and Law Enforcement Officer Report Three Class A Sightings in Same Area Within a Year near the town of Somers,41.29873,-73.73717,9/1/2010,31940,Class A,dr7dfn4nx3,92.24,80.81,69.38,67.34,0.68,0.05,0.76,0,0,,1016.8,Clear throughout the day.,8,6.922,219,1.01
"I live in Butte, Montana. This is a city mostly on a hill, but stretches down into a valley. On the east side, there is a great stretch of mountains known as the east ridge. This is where I was when I saw a sasquatch. In the middle of the hill, south of the Lady of the Rockies, there are two smaller hills jutting out of the middle of the hill. I was on the northern side of the southernmost small peak, heading down to go back to my vehicle. I was heading through some trees when I looked to the north at the other hill. This hill comes up further out from the main mountain than the hill that I was on. The peak is therefore more west, and then heading east it slopes down, flattens out, then heads back up the main mountain. I was looking through these trees I was heading through up at the flattened part of that hill. I was looking right at this tree. I'd say it was a good ten feet tall. I'd say I was about 200-300 yards away from this tree. He must have seen me, because when he walked out from behind that tree, I could tell he was looking right at me. And something about the way he timed it tells me he wanted to scare me. I'd say he was about 8 feet tall, judging from the distance, and he walked just like the saquatch in the old video of him walking through that small clearing in the forest. You all know the one. Probably the most popular one out there. His arms swayed back and forth, hanging limply from his shoulders. He walked about 15 feet then disappeared behind another tree. I have no doubt in my mind of what I saw.","On the East Ridge, south of The Lady of the Rockies.

"My two friends and I were camping near Busick, NC, just east of the Smokey Mountain National Park.   We were northeest of Asheville, near the Blue Ridge Parkway.    (Busick is so small that google earth does not have a marker for it.)   On the first of the two nights we were there, we heard wierd yells going through the woods right after dark.   Later, while we were sitting near the campfire playing dominos, we heard the same yell and heard rustling in the woods nearby.   We couldn't distinguish what it was because there were some people singing christian hymns at a small theatre nearby.   Later that night, when I was asleep, my friends(they were brothers) were talking about the upcoming wedding of one of them this coming spring and the younger brother says that he saw it move through the woods very close to our camp.   He told me about it the next day and I got kind of scared, since I may have seen a bigfoot in New Mexico back in 1994 while in the boy scouts.   The next day the two brothers went on a long hike and I stayed in camp since I was experiencing foot problems and had no hiking boots.    I got really bored so I decided to walk down what seemed to be a game trail into the woods for a few hundred yards.   I noticed that there were a lot of trees that were broken, like something had bended them.   None of these trees were very thick, but there were a few that I knew I could not snap.   I started to get a little scared, like something wasn't right.   I was only about a 1/4 mile from the campground, and I saw it.   It scared the s**t out of me.   I only saw it for about 10-15 seconds(maybe, I was so scared it could've been 5 seconds or it could have been a minute), and the best way to describe it would be that it looked like the bigfoot from Harry and the Hendersons only it was heavier and a little bit darker.   I was probably about 15-30 feet from it when I saw it.   We stared at each other for the duration of my sighting, and then it walked away as if I wasn't anything to worry about.    I stood in that spot for a little while and then walked back to the campsite, stopping every now and then to look around for the thing.   I told my friends about it and after describing the thing the one brother who saw it the night before said that it was probably the same thing he saw.","Pisgah National Forest, Black Mountain Campground",Yancey County,North Carolina,Summer,Report 30860: Daylight sighting by camper at Black Mountain Campground near Blue Ridge Parkway,35.75278,-82.22121,8/21/2011,30860,Class A,dnme3h874c,78.53,70.4,62.27,66.09,0.89,0.36,0.74,0,0,,1015.66,Foggy in the morning.,10,7.22,237,0.22

More noteworthy, however, was a stick formation that I found a little bit farther down the path on a slightly elevated area of land. It was small, maybe three feet high, but constructed in the same woven-looking manner characteristic of other possible bigfoot stick formations. Other than that, I did not find anything else unusual. It may not be extremely compelling evidence, but I figured it was worth telling experts, who could then take it as far as they saw fit.","From I-95 S, merge onto RI-4 S toward North Kingstown.

"I was driving from Columbia Falls to St. Regis Montana to pick up my daughter Jessica. She had spent the weekend with her father who lives in Spokane Washington. It was a bright sunny afternoon either the last weekend of Feburary or the first weekend in March. The time was 3:55 PM on a Sunday. I remember the time as I had just looked at the clock on my dash and we always exchange Jessica on Sunday. We had been following the river for some time and I noticed the ice was breaking up from around the edges and floated down stream. My daughters 15 year old boyfriend was traveling with me. We were traveling west on highway 135 at aproximately 60/65 MPH towards St. Regis. As we started over the bridge that spans the clark fork river I looked to my left as I always do. I like to look for deer and other wild life along the river bank. There is a sand bar that reaches out into the river on the west side and near the tip I saw a very tall (8 to 10 feet) hairy being and a much smaller one. It looked to be right at or just  taller then the knee of the larger one. The larger one was standing about 5 to 6 feet behind the small one with it's arms outstreched and taking a step forward. The small one looked as if it was curious about the chuncks of ice that were near the waters edge as it was leaning forward looking down. The tall one had long reddish brown hair. I remember seeing it flow from the upper arm area, and the hair on it's head and shoulders was also long. It looked silky and shown in the bright sun light. The small one looked to be the same color with shorter hair. When I saw them I said to my daughters boyfriend, ""Look at that!!!"" He said ""WHOA!!"" then we were over the bridge. We looked at each other with our mouths open. We didnt turn around, I think we were stunned and didnt quite believe what we had just seen, maybe a bit scared too?. We didnt talk about it on the way back. After picking up my daughter, the two of them were excited to see each other and talked non-stop in the back seat. I did look at the sand bar on the way back over the bridge which was about 30-40 minutes later, but I didn't see anything. I didnt tell my husband about this until a few weeks ago. I'd been trying to convince my self I didnt really see what I saw. Then one night at dinner I told my family what I had seen. My husband said, ""YA RIGHT!"" My daughter's boyfriend happened to be there for dinner and said, ""Kelly, I remember that, I was there with you!"" He and I hadn't talked about this until that night. I knew then I had to send our siting to the BFRO. I totally believe that what he and I saw was a mother Bigfoot and her young child. I got the feeling in that brief moment, that she was showing her young one something new, allowing him or her to explore. Perhaps her baby had gone too close to the river and she was reaching out as if to say ""that is far enough!"" Just as I have done with my own children.",To the right of the bridge is a public boat launch on the east side of the river.

"I am not sure that I had sighting. The reason I am writing this is because I listened to the ""Whoops and Knocks"" recording from CA, and it reminded me of what I heard while I was hunting on Tuesday afternoon. I was hunting with friends in the Swan Valley of MT. I do not know the exact location, because we were in the backwoods, and traveling on back roads off of Highway 83. We were on the east side of the highway north of Condon and I beleive south of town Swan. My Partner and I split up (our other partner was in his truck up the road). He was to my left 150 yards and in front of me by 200 yards. I saw something brown in the corner of my eye pass behind a tree to my right, hoping it was a deer or elk, I started to head in that direction. My partner contined heading toward and through a ravine. I would walk, and then stop for about 10-20 seconds looking around. I kept hearing a knocking sound. I thought it was a very close woodpecker, but could never see one.Plus it was really loud. After I decided that I must of lost the deer or elk, I decided to head down into the ravine my friend has been went through about 5-10 minute before me. The knocking sound became loud and I was sure that it just was very loud wood pecker, or deer ruttings(The rut is not for a couple of more weeks). The sound always came from the right of me. After hearing knocks on the recording in the Seirra Mountains, I am about 98% sure that is what I heard. Wood or something hitting wood, which also explains the volume and pacing of the knocking. I walked down into a ravine and it got a littel louder. Then all of sudden the knocking just stopped. I decided to go find my partner and walked out the ravine to the other side. I could not find him, so I went back through the ravine, and heard more knocking.I walked back somwhere between 1/2 to mile to our drop off point on the road (I came out about 100 ft to right of the spot), and thought I heard and elk call (which none of my partners heard) but sounds very much like the whoop call after the 1/2 point of the recording. The two men I was hunting with are expereinced hunters and in the woods. It was my second time hunting.  I told them about what I thought was the elk call, and neither of them heard it. When I heard it I was probably atleast 1/2 mile from them. I did not mention the knocking, because I though it was bird, and no big deal. I have hiked/backpacked in Tenn,CT,NC,AZ, The Cascades in WA, Grand Coulee Dam Area of WA, and enjoy being in the woods. This is my first time that anything like this has happened. I will leave the verdict up to you, You are the experts not me. If this was a sighting then great I am glad that I could help.

I was 11 or 12 at the time. I was at a boyscout Jamboree. My friend came to me and asked if I beleived in bigfoot. He then told me to follow him because he saw a bigfoot. We walked about a half mile to the rivers edge. Accross the river we watched what looked like a large gorilla like creature about 6 ft tall standing next to the river picking leaves off a bush and eating them. We watched for a couple minutes until it walked into the brush and disappeared. It was not a bear. It picked the leaves off the tree just as a human would.

"It was about 3 p.m. Early in December of 2012. I was up at my cabin cutting up an elk and had to run into town to get some pork suit for hamburger. I have made it a habit to keep track of where the ranchers have their cattle near the highway so I know where the elk will or will not be. On my way back I was driving about 60 mph while scanning a ridge side and tree line where I had seen elk before when I noticed something very out of place and very dark running along the tree line. I don't know whether it was cause I was in disbelief or I was just being a good driver, but I literally did a triple take after noticing it. It was about 230 to 300 yards away and I could make it out quite well. The thing was on two legs, had very long arms that seemed to end barely above the knees, its head was positioned as if a person were sticking their neck out, and it ran while barely moving its arms. It didn't look like it was alarmed, just as if it were just going along its way heading back into the mountains. In scale to the trees I'd say it was about six a half feet tall.  I watched it for about ten seconds or so ( as much as I could without wrecking, don't know why I didn't stop) and there's no way it was anything else. I've had a few other encounters, but nothing as concrete as this. There was no way this thing was anything else.","Between WSS and Checkerboard, just west of Sutherland Lake.",Meagher County,Montana,Winter,Report 41782: Man-like figure seen running along a tree-line off Hwy. 12 near Checkerboard,46.59692,-110.6268,12/2/2012,41782,Class B,c8334dsn8x,45.69,36.905,28.12,28.78,0.67,,0.63,0.0037,1,rain,,Breezy until evening and light rain in the evening.,0,,206,14.31
"In mid july 2004 I was on my back porch it faces east and it faces a mountain I live in the woods on the side of my house where the creature was the house is scarecly wooded and the land is flat.  The sun was shining. The reason I went out side is this, my dogs started to bark and run through the house they got half way through the dog door stopped an whined. I thought that was odd so I went and sat on the back porch. Then I saw the tree to my left move and the tree was about 300 yards away from me or less I am bad with measurements.  So I watched the tree to see what caught my eye and then I saw the creature.  It was behind the tree looking out from behind it.  It's head was in the banches and it was hunching.   Is's head was large and it had a definate brow I thought I was seeing an oranatang.  Except it was about 6 and ahalf feet tall.  It was moving it's head aroud the tree to watch me as I stood up to get a better look. It's hair was a rust color like to color of dead pine needles, It's eyes were haunting. And it was completely silent.  It was watching me while I was watching it.  I sat back down.  I watched outside for about 6 minutes and didn't tell the person on the phone. Then I went in the house and watched throught the window to make sure it wasn't a trick of shadow.  Then the creature moved in front of the tree, staying hunched over but watching me in the window. I watched a few more minutes and then went to the back of the house when I went back it was gone.  While this was going on my kids were in the front yard playing in the water.  I think if the creature had been aggressive it would have made some sort of move. but it d=seemed peaceful. It seemed to be curious I think it was young to be in such a vulnerable open area. When my husband came home we went out to the tree and all of the knapweed was completely trampled down around the tree. We didn't find any hair though.

"Firstly, let me say that I am an educated man who works in the medical field at our trauma hospital in Montana.  The other witness is a Deputy Sheriff.   Both of us are in our mid-thirties, married and have children.  Neither of us however, drink, use drugs, or in any way were incapacitated during the time of the 'sighting'. It would also be relevant to tell you that I grew up in Washington where I spent countless summers camping, hiking, and enjoying the outdoors.  My good friend grew up in Oregon and spent a great deal of time hunting, camping and recreating in the outdoors. We both now live in Missoula, Montana and have never heard the sounds like we did last night, on 01/23/2005. My buddy and I returned from a coffee at Barnes and Noble and he was dropping me off in my driveway near 2030 hours.  The moon was pretty full last night and it was cloudless, so visibility was pretty good.  Behind my new home, which sits on nearly two acres, is a large hill that descends on the other side to a partially wooded area in a canyon where deer are seen all the time.  The heavier, more dense forest starts less than a mile away, and in fact heads into the mountains. As we conversed in my driveway, the COMPLETE silence was broken by this god-awful howl/growl/moan that echoed the whole valley. The volume was overwhelming.  Immediately, my dog, as well as multiple dogs on the road, began barking and almost seemingly panicked.  Now please let me tell you that we get elk, deer, bear and mountain lion around here pretty consistently, but never any reaction from the dogs like this. We went behind my house where my dog was no longer barking, but instead just shivering and looking up at the hill - just as 'it' did it again.  The sound is so incredibly similar to the 'howl' you have on your site that it is eerie. A third series of growls (and let me tell you they were deep and extremely loud) soared across our neighborhood. I let my dog have refuge in his fenced kennel where he retreated to his doghouse.  My dog is a year old lab who has grown up exposed to many wild animals. We waited but the noise finally stopped after 1-2 minutes.  We both commented on how the hair on the back of our necks were sticking up and that neither of us had heard ANYTHING like that before in all our years. My friend left and I headed into the house where I felt compelled to load hollow point slugs into my shotgun.

"I went to visit my brother who had gotten a firefighting job up in Montana recently and on one of his days off, I wanted to go up into the secluded woods on a hike. Since he was working with the forestry service, he knew of a place that was very secluded and was extremely thick forested. We hiked about a mile and a half up into the mountains and about half way up, we crossed a little creek about 4 to 5 feet wide. I stopped and pulled out my phone to take a picture of the upstream view. I got the picture and we continued on without realizing what he had just done. Later that night I was going through the pictures of that days hike, when I came across something in one of the pictures that was extremely startling. About 45-50 feet from where I took the picture, there was a black figure that seemed to be sitting near the bank of the creek looking right as us. Curious about what I had seen, a few days later when my father arrived to visit my brother, I took him to the place I had taken the picture. Sure enough, where there had so clearly been something sitting next to the creek, there was nothing. In fact there were even freshly broken branches off trees that were no where near the spot it was sitting.

"On November 24th, 2012, at 9:00 AM, I was elk hunting on the west facing slope of Mount Baldy, above a closed forest service road called Baldy Face Road. There was a complete trail of these bi-pedal tracks leading around the face of the mountain. I've taken a picture of a track with my boot next to it as a point of reference as to the size of the track. My boot measures exactly one foot, and four and half inches wide, and my average step is about three feet. I am six foot and one inches and had to leap to reach each track. I'm guessing it had a rough estimate of a five foot step, which were heading north, north east up the mountain. I know it wasn't a snowshoe because snow shoes are so long that they overlap themselves, and have a hinged claw in the middle for traction which these tracks showed no sign of. Each step was long and clean, bearing no signs of drag. I guessed the tracks to be about 4-5 days old. I side hilled the mountain heading south, then down to the road back north, only to see my tracks being the only ones up off the road since it snowed. I've never crossed another person's tracks up there before, since its a pretty secluded area that has hidden lakes for the willing hiker. But never a track like this one ever.

"Hi, My name is [J.G].  I was driving for express shuttle.   My job was to deliver railroaders to their train.   Or to move crews from one train to the other.   A few months ago, I saw something that just wasn't right.   No crew in the van because I'd been called to the coal mine to move one crew from a train to another train at the mine. On the way out there, it's a long lonely road at night.   I dropped down over the Decker hill and something was walking along the right hand side of the road.   There's always Indians, ""Native Americans"" walking out that road looking to get a ride.   That's what I thought I saw.   But it walked across the road in front of me.   I had to hit the binders hard.   It wouldn't look at me.   Just stood on the left shoulder of the road.   It did kind of look over it's shoulder at me but I didn't get any facial features.   It swayed when it turned. I did notice that it had long hair, almost like it was groomed. Probably 8-10 inches long.   Couldn't tell you what color it was because it was almost midnight and it was in the headlights. The next day, I had to make a daylight run.   I stopped and measured bushes, fence, and such.   This thing was at least 8 feet tall.  I looked for hair on the barbed wire, or tracks.   Nothing. This happened in the old town of Decker Montana.   Decker was moved with the coal strike.   I remember where the old town was.  When you are driving North, you drop over a hill and the town was on the left.   My mother in law used to have the restaurant.   But it's gone now.   However, this is where I encountered him/her when I dropped over the hill. I did see deer before and after the sighting.   It was almost like they weren't worried because they were within 200 yards.

We unzipped the tent and went outside. We heard some rustling from behind our tent as we turned around to look there was a Bigfoot just standing there looking at us and we were looking back at him. He was right beside a pine tree and where he came on the tree he had to be 8 or 9 feet tall. The moonlight came through the thick Forrest to cast just enough light on him. He or she was albino. The fur was completely white. I couldn't tell you what color the eyes were. My daughter and I both looked at this creature and didn't say a word .

"It was in January 2006 when a good friend, my 26-year-old nephew and I went camping on some private land in Stokes County near Pilot Mountain. This private land operates as a summer camp during the summer and hosts small retreat groups during the fall, winter and spring months. I attended this summer camp for many years as a youth and then lived and worked there during the off-season as an adult. In addition, I have been camping at this very spot a dozen times within the past few years. In the summertime, the woods at night are alive with the sounds of nocturnal animals, crickets and frogs. During the winter months when all of the leaves have fallen off of the trees, the woods are dead silent at night. The only sounds you can hear are the wind and the occasional dog barking in the distance. So after we set up camp, we ate dinner and sat around the campfire for a while. We climbed into the tent and went to sleep around midnight. I drifted off to sleep and was awakened at about 2:30am by my nephew tossing and turning. He told me that he had indigestion from the dinner we ate and he asked if I had any antacids. He asked my friend too and we both indicated that we didn’t pack any. He then said that he needed to get up and walk it off. My nephew then proceeded to unzip the tent flap and go outside by the campfire. By then the fire had died out and I could hear him scratching around in the ashes looking for hot embers and cracking small sticks to build the fire again. Soon, I could see the light of the fire flickering against the side of the tent and hear the crackle and pop of burning wood. It was at this time that the most unusual sound pierced the silence. The sound came from the woods immediately surrounding our campsite and it could only be described as a loud yelp.  In all my years spent camping on this land, some in this very spot, I have never heard a sound like this one. The souund was very similar to the yelp recorded on your website except that it was slightly higher pitch and was much closer. There wasn't any echo. Immediately after hearing this sound my eyes shot open and my nephew who was still cracking sticks around the fire froze in silence. My mind was racing to think of what could have made this sound when I heard the tent flap quickly unzip, my nephew tumble inside and then quickly zip the flap back-up again. The three of us immediately whispered to each other and then lay silent. The next morning and every time we’ve been camping since we’ve always had a good laugh at my nephew’s expense.

"October 2011 we found footprints leading away from our outdoors fire pit. Something had stepped in wet ashes after a big storm. We could see where it had tried to wipe ash off on rocks and then took long strides across the yard. Several years later (year not recalled) on a camping trip near same area. At about 7pm I heard heavy footfalls, a knock in a pattern of 5 or 6 knocks. Then about 100 yards away from that I heard another commotion and more heavy footfalls running toward the 1st. It sounded like the 2 animals met and a flock of turkeys sleeping in a thicker was just anihilated. The attack lasted 15 seconds with the turkeys screeching and flapping loudly. Later that night I heard the same knocking pattern and then an answer in the far distance with the same pattern. A few years later back at my home. During a break in a huge storm at about 2 am I heard something trying to climb over wire fence in my back yard. My son and I went out with guns as we've had some vandalism incidents. On the back porch, the fence was still shaking and we heard footsteps crashing to our left. I yelled out for whoever it might be to leave us alone. I announced we were armed. Then we heard a loud crack like a rifle shot from the direction of the footsteps. At this time we were really afraid and I emptied my shotgun toward the crack sound. There were several more pops and I pushed my son and now awake wife back in the house and then emptied my 22 rifle also. As my son handed me the shotgun he'd reloaded... the cracking increased and I realized something was pushing a huge tree over and the cracks were the splitting of wood. The tree crashed to the ground literally shaking the whole house. My family pushed their way back outside, terrified.

"In connection with report #8804, my house is approximately 5 miles south of this sighting.  Throughout the spring of 2004, our neighborhood was disturbed regularly by something walking through the woods at night.  Almost everyone in the neighborhood was affected, in that we would hear footsteps, twigs snapping, and one neighbor heard scratching on the side of the house.  Outside my kitchen window, which is about 8 feet off the ground, the plants are all smashed down like something repeatedly stood there.  My neighbor sleeps with his bedroom windows open and hears it approaching in the middle of the night.  The dogs in the area would absolutely go nuts!

"I live on 1010 Highway near the Johnston County Airport. Its kind of a country road , couple swampy areas and such, a good hunting area you could say. I was on my way back from the beach at my dad's house, my sister was with me. I'm 24 she's only 15. Anyway, I just turned out of the local BBQ place for some food (White Swan open 24 hrs) to head home. I got past the local livestock building, and turned onto 210 Hwy, drove about 3-4 minutes, turned onto 1010 or Cleveland Rd. There was an old car parked on the side of the road, so I could hardly see to turn left, so when I did, I drove for maybe 10-15 seconds when I saw eyes in front of me (it was about 9:15 in the PM) I turned lights on bright and I thought it was a homeless man walking along the road, but seeing someone walking down here when its dark is unlikey, I slow down ,I didn't know if it was gonna cross the road , I was driving about 35  in a 45 mph zone. As I got closer I noticed it was not a man, it was something else, like a bear walked up right with long legs and arms longer than a man, had dark hair, I couldn't really see the color very well. He was about as big as my grandfather and he is 6' 11'' . I was speechless, and my sister was scared to death because our house is 1 minute from where he was at.

"My buddy and I were camping on July 2, 2005, in the [Blue Ridge mountains] of western NC, several miles outside of [a mountain town].  At midnight, we were preparing to retire for the night to our respective tents, when we heard a prolonged howl which was about as far away from us as the 1994 Columbiana, OH, howl (on the BFRO website) seemed from its source.  At least, that's the best way I could determine the distance from us.  This howl was at least twice as long (I want to say even longer) as the Columbiana, OH, howl.  I'd estimate the howl we heard to be more or less ten seconds long. It was the length of the call, as much as it was the deep tone and strength of it, which attracted our immediate attention.  It just didn't seem to quit.  It wasn't interrupted, either, like if the creature took a breath and then continued.  This went on continuously for around 10 seconds. Although we only heard the one howl, it was so loud (for its distance from us) and so prolonged, and gained strength at the end instead of waning, that we were rather shaken by its magnitude .... commenting to each other that nothing human or zoological that we knew of, could possibly have made that noise. I have studied/researched Sasquatches since grad school in Idaho in the mid-1970's, even though my degree is in Literature/English.  I roamed the Rockies of the NW every chance I got for most of five years, looking for evidence, tracks, sign, sounds, anything......found zilch.  This is the first experience I have had, and even though auditory, it was exhilirating.  Both my friend and I were struck by the animal-like characteristics of this howl, and tried to think of things which might have made the sound, OTHER than a sasquatch.  No, we decided quite without hesitation, it couldn't have been a machine-made sound (like a siren) because it was too low in tone.  No, we decided, it couldn't have been fireworks, as they tend to ""scream"" and then wane, whereas this howl was low in tone and went on for a number of seconds (beyond 5 or 6 secs.) and gained momentum and strength toward the end, so we ruled fireworks out.  Since it was July 4th weekend, that's why this was a consideration.  No human could make that loud a howl for that period of time.... human lung capacity way too small, we concluded. And, on we went, trying to explain to each other the howl/sound by some origin other than a sasquatch.  He and I had been joking and talking for the past several years about perhaps encountering one, hearing one, etc., but never really expected this to happen.  When it did, we wanted to try to cover all the potentialities for the source of such a sound, and a sasquatch is all we could come up with, esp. Since I had heard the Columbiana Ohio sound on your website, and was immediately reminded of it when hearing (and replaying in my head) that sound on 7/2/05.  We went back to that same campsite a few weeks later, hoping for a ""repeat performance,"" but no such luck. We had a lab-mix retriever with us both times.  The night we heard the sound, the dog became very animated, very intently listening to that distant howl, but because it was so far away, it didn't seem too bothered by it, though it DID move off into the forest toward the direction of the howl, but soon returned.  Both the dog and we maintained something of a vigil that night, but no other indications of that critter's presence were made known to us.","I'd rather not give any more specific a location than I have given for on-line use, as we hunt in this vicinity and the fewer people who know about it, the better for the critters AND us.

"It was the first week of December 2002. I was camping with my friend [edited], in Macon County, North Carolina. We had been there 2 days. We decided to take one of our usual late night walks. Because of the weather we were one of only three sites occupied. There was an icestorm on the way and we were planning to leave early the next morning. We had crossed the river and walked about 200 yards to the gates when we were startled by a scream that made the hair on my neck stand up. I have spent my entire life in the outdoors, much of it in wilderness areas and I have never heard anything like this in my life.  I was carrying my sidearm and immediately drew it and aimed my maglite in the direction of the scream. The next thing we knew,several rocks were thrown in our direction.

We listened to a few songs; when we decided to play the Sierra Sounds cd with bigfoot recordings on it.  As we listened to the cd we all became jumpy and the feeling of someone was watching us came over us.  We then started hearing sounds of what sounded like saplings being broken up above us; higher up in the mountain.  We just laughed it all off as nerves.  Then we heard what sounded like a tree about ten inches around being broke then slide down the mountain at us.  All us became scared and ran to the porch of the house for protection.

We were probably traveling about 35mph. we looked at each other as if to see if the other was seeing the same thing i leaned forward in my seat to see if it was a bear, about that time we realized it was walking on two legs and was kinda side stepping and it was staring right at us. it was moving from the left side of the road to the right and then just disappeared into a field. we slowed down just as we approached the spot, it was and it was gone, no sign of it at all. this was something that neither of us had ever seen!

"I backpack in Uwharrie with a group of up to six kids on a regular basis as a trip leader for a wilderness outing program.  This past winter I experienced the same strange occurrance on two different occasions in the same spot at a primitive campsite our group had scratched out along the Super Tree Loop in the Woodrun area of the forest.  During the wee hours of the morning in Dec. and once again in Jan. I've heard footsteps crunching through the heavy layer of dried leaves on the forest floor.  This ""person"" was buswhwacking and not walking along the trail.  ""It"" also came from the direction of deep woods just behind my tent and not anywhere near the main trail.  Both times it crossed over the trail and continued on bushwacking through the woods in an easterly direction.  I have to admit I was a little nervous about even moving around in my tent because I didn't want to attract attention.  I laid there frozen both times until the thing was gone and didn't get a look at it.  Both incidents happened on especially cold nights in Uwharrie (mid to upper teens).  Hunting season was long over as well.  Whatever it was did not use a flashlight and walked through the dense woods of this area smoothly without missing a step.

A friend and I was camping at Arrowhead Campground at Uwharrie Nat Forrest. We heard something in the woods on the outskirts of the camp probing the camping area. The next morning my friend asked me if I heard something. I told him that I did and I just did not think anything about it. I asked him what he thought it was. He said it was definately walking on two feet and it was not a person. By the sound of the breaking branches he said it had to be big. It was late October and the ground had a lot of leaves and sticks on the ground. We where at campsites 14a and 14b if I recall correctly. Arrowhead Campground is located near Badin Lake and wildlife is abundant including deer. My friend was a skeptical before that but he was a little stifled by the sounds we heard that night. I asked him if it could have been a horse wandering from the above horse camp or a bear and he said it was walking on two feet like a man but had to be much larger because of the amount of noise of the breaking branches and leaves.

"A friend and I were camping in the Big Creek Campground in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park right on the Tennessee and North Carolina border. It was dark. We just finished cleaning up after dinner and were walking to the restroom to get ready for bed.  We heard crashing and the excited snorting sound deer make when startled.  We had flashlights with us and shined them on some deer that were looking toward the forest.  There was a trail which went up the side of the mountain in the direction the deer were staring.  They turned their attention toward us for a second but then continued looking toward the trail. They ran a few feet and made some noise and stopped again to stare in the same direction.  We figured a bobcat, coyote or something scared them. Eventually the deer slowly calmed down and crept back to where they were originally browsing.  This all lasted about 5 minutes. We were walking back to the camp when out of the dark (in the direction the deer were looking) came a long call. It echoed through the woods.  We thought it sounded like a primate - some kind of monkey or ape. Eventually I stumbled on your website and read how you use gibbon calls to attract sasquatches.  I then got curious and started checking out different animal calls.  The call of a gibbon is exactly the sound we heard that night. I wish at the time we had thought it could be Bigfoot, but we didn't, so we never took off into the night to look or it or look for prints. The noise wasn't a recording.

"I was around seven years old when this happened. I have never forgotten what I saw! My sister and I have talk bout it a lot, but I have not talked to outsiders in fear of being labeled crazy, or being laughed at. It was in the fall of the year, late September 1967. My father raised tobacco in the small community called churchland, one of the many small townships in Davidson County. At that time we were renting an old homestead owned by a lawyer, who is now deceased. We lived out in the sticks, right next to the Yadkin River, which separates Davidson County from Davie County. My father was on the tractor coming from the tobacco field that evening, my older sister and some friends where on the back on the trailer that was used to haul tobacco from the field. It was dusk my father had just turned on the tractor lights. I was setting on his lap. We were almost to our tobacco barn when this huge thing stepped out in front of the tractor into the lights. It stopped right in front of us, turned toward us and paused. The face resembled a man, much lighter than the rest of him, but his body was covered in dark hair. It was taller that my dad who was around six foot and it was a lot bigger than him. Its arms were dropped past its waist. It acted like we were no threat, and turned and took a big step and it was in the woods. My dad put the brakes on, left the tractor running, left me sitting in the driver's seat and jumped off to follow it. I started crying, because I didn’t know what it was.  I even thought at that time it was the booger man that would get you if you were not good. That is what my parent’s would tell us kids. My father came back, not saying a word and took us kids back to the house. He told my mom not to let us out. He then took his coon hunting gun and left to hunt it down. He later returned that night. He could not find the thing we saw. We had to stay in the front yard after that. We later moved to a farm that my dad had purchased a few miles away from this one, still the Yadkin River, flowed right next to our farm. For years I wondered what the heck it was that we saw. Years later in the late seventies, more and more was on TV about what is now known as Bigfoot.

"the morning of april, 24, 2007. it was around 330-345 am. i was getting ready for work. after getting dressed, i took the dog out for his morning walk. it was a very still morning, no wind or any other noises to notice. it was unseasonably cool. the dog always has his normal routine, walk out the door, go to the edge of the driveway and use the bathroom. about the time he was making his way toward the end of the driveway he starts growling towards the treeline in front of the house. i was very attentive to him as he had never done this before. i stood there for about a minute trying to see into the darkness of the trees. as i was starting back to the house with the dog by my side. i heard a bone chilling howl and something that sounded like wood being hit on the trees. the sounds were, or it seemed only a matter of feet away. i quickly turned in the direction that i thought the sounds to be coming from and for a moment thought i caught a glimpse of something standing beside a tall tree along the treeline. i stood there for just a minute, but never noticed any more movement. after going back inside, i finished getting ready for work, went outside, as i was walking to my suv i could here twigs breaking from the footsteps. after getting into my vehicle, i put it into reverse and i could have sworn i saw something huge walk around the fenceline, up the adjoining driveway, around a pond that connects the two properties. at lunch when i returned, i noticed what looked like distured leaves on the ground in the area where i had seen and heard the thing. my dog to this day still will not go to the edge of the driveway without me. the howls sounded just like the ohio howl.",Edit,Davidson County,North Carolina,Spring,Report 18943: Possible pre-dawn approach to property outside Winston-Salem,35.95815,-80.2084,5/3/2007,18943,Class B,dnquwcfp2u,69.11,60.41,51.71,56.24,0.78,0.69,0.54,0.0004,0.56,rain,1018.93,Mostly cloudy throughout the day.,6,8.57,40,4.39

"On Aug 26 around 2:20-2:30am my two cousins were driving back from Minot, they took the back roads to get home faster. They were about 2-3 miles from home on Counrty Road 7 when they said that they were just talking and notice on the left side in the North bound lane a large brown hairy 7-8ft tall thing was standing there, they said they were going about 50-55mph and slowed down a bit, as they passed by it they taped on the brake and in the brake lights they saw it and punched it back home, they said they were so scared that they were going aleast 90mph to get back. As they got to one of my cousins house they went and wroke my Uncle up and told him that they saw big foot. Then they drove to my house and wroke me up, so i said them ""yeah right like you seen a big foot around here"". They were both scared and shaking so thats when i knew that they saw something, so I took two spotlights a 5 million and a 3.5 million, my Uncle had a 1 million light also. We asked them to show us, in which they were both agreed after the calmed down a bit. we left there car and took my Aunts van and headed north, they showed us the spot and i marked by throwing out a full water bottle and I asked them which way do you think it was going and if they seen more, she said that ""it might of been moving West"", so we headed West bound on Country Rd. 6 just North of White Shield as we headed about 1-2miles west from Country Rd. 7 we turned North bound on Country Rd. 5 as we were spotlighting in the cut Wheat Fields. I was on the passenger side and my Uncle was driving we were both looking around with the lights when I picked up a bright RED reflection of eyes, as i told my Uncle to stop i notice that this thing was on all fours  moving west towards us and then it stop and what looked like it sat down, i mean it looked like a gorrilla from the movies. As we stoped and sat there we must of been watching it for about 3-5mins, It seemed unreal to me but as i started to realize that this is happing and that we don't have gorrilla's in North Dakota that is when my Uncle notice two more sets of eyes behind the one we were watching, my cousins started screaming and cussing at us to leave and to get the Cops and Game & Fish, so after that we started to turn around and head back in i noticed it stood up that's when i said hurry up lets get Game & Fish out here. When i arrived at my house my cousin called the BIA and they said they will contact the Game Warden. My Uncle and I told my cousin to tell them that we are going to go back out there and wait for the Game Warden, my cousins stayed. My cousin husband wanted to go with us. As we started to turn on country Rd. 5 thats when we noticed the smell of pee and old sweet and slew odor, it wasn't us because i checked the smell inside that van and it smelled better then the  outside. We stoped and jumped out and started to listen, thats when we noticed the truck lights on Country Rd. 6 it was the Game Warden. We flashed him down and talked to him and gave all the info so he said he will check the field out and left moving East with all his spotlights on. As we talked my Uncle said ""try to call it"" so my cousin husband made a howling sound and sure enough another sound came back a faint bellow South West of us about 1/2-1mi. There is no cattle around there so we started to head in that direction and stoped where we thought the sound was at. we had the windows down and started to listen for any sound, there was none not even crickets or birds or grasshoppers chirping so we turned around and left, stoped Game Warden and we stated looking untill 7am that morning, we noticed that there were lots of slew and deep weeds a place for a good hiding spot. On the next day we started looking for prints and we found some impressions in the cut wheat field and ditch, the prints were close to 15 1/5 inches and about 5 1/2 - 6 inches wide. We stoped a BIA officer and told him that we found some imprssions so he came out there and took some pictures, the foot prints pointed in a East direction as we started to track them we found 3 other sets that seemed like they were zigziging around, after an 30min or so we track it to a tree row where it seemed that there were spots of cut hay put into piles and pine tree branches 2in thick snaped off, the sap still ozzing out from the break, and sunflower or tall weeds stems in that spot, there was no tall weeds around that spot, so we walked around and found a slew just at the end of the tree row about 200yards away, had the same stems from the weeds. On the 31st of Aug my Uncle and I kinda made a path of direction, it looks like they follow slews and small ponds maybe for drinking water. The direction was taking them to Lake Sakakawea, has we tested taht theory we were West of White Shield when we heard a low scream, a dog that lived at a farm house started to bark. Where the spot we seen it and to the location where we heard it, are theory was correct. On Sept 4 since we left them alone for a couple of days we went to the spot where we thought the would be at.. NO Luck they weren't there so that was the end of the search or hunt, until Sept 9 when 6 kids saw a tall black thing running on two legs heading West on BIA 1 just 1/2mi North of White Shield, I talked to the kids and the said when it was running in the field it was black and on two legs and as it crossed the road it took 3 steps and it was on the other side. This was around 9pm and the sun was setting. By the time the kids told it was dark, my Uncle and I drove back there and found nothing, the next day Sept 10 we tried to find the path where this thing or big foot crossed, we are still looking for signs or even better prints. Thats it for now.. will update later","From Garrison take Highway 37 west, keep going west when you hit 1804 to White Shild then turn North on BIA 1 which takes you thru White Shield, North of White Shield about 1/2 mile you will hit Country Road 6 that where big foot was seen crossing the road...",McLean County,North Dakota,Summer,Report 12562: Multiple witness sighting near White Shield,47.71188,-101.8886,8/27/2005,12562,Class A,c8rx3mwvze,75.24,60.49,45.74,48.76,0.7,,0.78,0,0,,1011.85,Clear throughout the day.,0,,316,8.84

"The following occured in 1975 when I was 14 years old.  My family lived in Bellevue, Nebraska (near Offutt Air Force Base) where my father had recently retired from the U.S. Air Force after 24 years of active duty.  I now live in Florida. Actually, this incident was a series of three encounters over a three-day period.  A bit of background seems necessary.  My girlfriend lived on the next block.  Our houses were separated by a field with a stand of trees on the north side of the field; the stand of trees was approximately 20 feet wide at that time and ran East-West.  The stand of trees ran to the East to Bellevue Blvd.  On the East side of Bellevue Blvd. was a heavely forested area that was either a part of, or bordered, Fontenelle Forest.  I would go over to my girlfriend's  house and visit until it was time for me to go back home (my curfew was 10:00 pm during the summer). The first incident occurred as I was crossing the field on my way home around 10:00 p.m.  I was walking in a NW direction with the thick stand of trees to my right.  I heard heavy foot-falls and occasional snapping of branchs within the stand of trees.  Whatever it was within the trees was paralleling me.  When I stopped, it stopped.  When I began walking again, it began walking.  It was very dark in the field and I could not see anything.  After several stops and starts, I became somewhat frightened and ran the rest of the way across the field, climbed over the 4-foot chainlink fence that surrounded our backyard, and ran up our backyard (it was basically a hill) and into the house. The second incident happened the very next night.  This occurrence happened exactly the same way as the first incident. The final incident happened on the third night.  As I crossed the field I again heard the heavy foot-falls and snapping of small branches within the stand of trees.  However, this time I was not being paralled; the thing was heading in a SW direction which placed it on an intercept course to my NW direction of travel.  I could hear it getting closer, but could not see anything because of the extreme darkness.  Near the point of interception, I began to smell a foul odor.  The odor was very stong and almost made me gag.  By now the foot-falls were very near.  I could feel the thing cross in front of me very close, but could not see anything.  The foot-falls were now on my left.  At this point I became extremely scared and began running across the field.  I'm not sure, but I suspect I cleared our 4-foot fence without even touching it. About half-way up the hill (our backyard) I stopped.  I can't explain why I did this, but I simply felt compelled to do so.  I turned around and saw what had crossed my path.  The backyard and a portion of the field was nicely illuminated by a flood-light my father had put on the back of the house. Standing at the edge of the field next to a clothes-line pole, was a creature on two legs.  It was covered in dark brown hair.  I estimate the height at 7 feet.  This is based on the fact that the clothes-line pole was 6 feet in height and the creature's head was a good foot above the top of the pole.  I was approximately 40-50 feet from it, but could not make out any facial features.  I recall that there was eye-shine, but I can't recall the color, possibly reddish.  The thing was extremely thick across the chest.  The arms hung almost to the knees.  This thing was very muscular.  We stood there staring at each other for approximately 20 seconds before I turned and ran into my house (I chickened out before it did). There is no question in mind that what I saw was a bigfoot.","Georgia Ave. and Tulip Ln. run East-West  My house was approximately 1/3 of a mile from Bellevue Blvd., which ran along the heavily forested area of Fontenelle Forest.",Sarpy County,Nebraska,Summer,Report 7809: Teen has nighttime sighting near Fontenelle Forest,41.134,-95.88,1/6/2005,7809,Class A,9z7f40nqfj,9.8,8.595,7.39,1.68,0.82,0.31,0.86,0.0009,0.52,snow,1020.34,Mostly cloudy starting in the evening.,2,8.21,212,1.49
"I was looking around on the internet last night and ran onto to your site and it brought back a memory of something that happened to me when I was around 18 years old. The best I can recall was that it was around 1979. So I thought I would go ahead and report it just incase someone else has also reported this. I have told several people about this but most just think I'm crazy but I know what I saw. It was a very cold winter morning (maybe December 1979 or January 1980), I lived on a farm. We had a long driveway and the mail box was at the end of the driverway. Just west of the mail box was a long shelterbelt with lots of trees. I went down to get the mail and pulled up to the mail box in my pickup when something caught my eye walking in the field so I pulled up to see better. What I saw was a large man like thing walking south in the field toward the sherlterbelt. It was approx. 1/4 mile west of me and approx. 10 to 20 yards north of the shelterbelt. I saw it for about 10 to 12 seconds is all. I remember it being dark brown with long hair. The wind was blowing fairly hard out of the north and I remember seeing the hair on it's arms and face blowing toward the front of it because the wind was at it's back. I also remember it having long arms and it took big steps. It kind of turned it's head and looked a little toward me and then walked a little faster and disappeared in the trees. I know it wasn't a man because no one would have been walking out there on such a cold morning. I had a high power rifle with a scope in my pickup but didn't have time to even pick it up and look through the scope at it. I wanted to go out there and look for tracks but I was afraid to. There was snow on the gound maybe about a foot worth. This field was a paster that it was walking in. The shelterbelt consisted of large old cottonwood trees and some pine trees.

"We live near Omaha, Nebraska. I am speaking on behalf of my mother. My mother first saw this ""thing "" when she was 10 years old. You have to understand the way the neighborhood we live in is set up. The house my mother lived in when she was 10 is less than a quarter mile away from the house that she lives in today. All of the yards in that neighborhood sort of connect with somewhat of a gully in the middle. The first time my mother had any knowledge of the thing, her sister and her were swinging on a double tire swing in her backyard. The next thing my mother knew, her sister had jumped off the swing and was running and screaming. My mom didn't know what to do, so she ran after her sister into the house. Her sister was hysterical saying she saw something in the back wooded area of their yard. I guess my grandpa did find some sort of large footprints. This was the first incident. The next incident was when my mom was outside her house when she was young. She saw a large thing covered in hair walking across her driveway. My mom told me that the ""thing"" walked almost as if it was bo-legged. She also said it's shoulders moved from side to side as it walked. Now my mother lives in the house I grew up in. As recently as two weeks ago, something has been seen in my mother's back yard. It hasn't only been seen by my mother, but also by my sister who frequently stays at my mom's house. About three years ago (April of 2002) is when my mom had her most vivid and frightening encounter with the ""thing"". She was letting our dogs out in the backyard and they both went barreling towards the fence surrounding our yard barking. My mom walked out in the yard, thinking nothing other than the dogs were just being dogs, and was standing waiting for them to use the bathroom. It was then when she noticed something moving in the next yard. She said it was about seven feet tall and standing behind a tree. She said as fast as the dogs had ran up to the fence to bark, they were running back to the house yelping. My mom said she froze. She always tells me the fear that she feels when she sees this ""thing"" is overwhelming. She said it then ""leaped"" from behind one tree to another. That's when she started running. She said she looked behind her and it was now coming forward towards her. She ran in the house and locked the doors. My mom lives in a brick house and she has also told me that on occasion she will hear something that sounds like something beating or throwing itself up against the side of her house. My mom is completely afraid of this ""thing"". We would really like someone to contact us or something. My mom doesn't really talk about this to anyone because she feels that they'd all think she was crazy.

"Audio Experience only: Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, wooo.... Sunday, September 12, 2004 at about 03:00 AM I was woken up from a sound sleep by a very loud noise.  I listened for a while and tried to figure out what could make such a loud, repetitive noise.  It wasn't a coyote howl or fishercat screach, didn't sound like any owl I know of, wasn't a raccoon or tree rodent...  After 15 - 20 minutes, I went to sleep. My dog woke me with frightened barking at 4:00 AM when the sound was twice as loud and I knew the critter was within 100 feet of the house.  Also, there were two responding calls, one sounded fairly close and one was in the distance.  I got up to make sure the sheep were OK in their pasture with an electric fence around it and there was nothing by the barn where the goats were.  I flashed the light over to the chicken coop and nothing was there either.  I flashed the light throughout the yard and into the trees to see if there was any clue or any danger to the animals.  I saw nothing and while I shone the light, the calls ceased. All day I asked EVERYONE if they knew of any local animal that made the noise and repeated it all day long.  A friend suggested that I look it up on the internet.  I listened to all sorts of animal vocalizations with no luck.  When I finally typed in the words of the actual sound it was an identical match to this site!!!  I'm not saying I had a bigfoot encounter, but I definately encountered whatever the campers up in Lincoln, NH encountered last summer!!!

"I had never thought of looking on the internet to report what my ex-girlfriend, a friend, and I saw one night. Didn't know a nationwide report site was on the net. At the time we were students at the local college. We drove one night out to Red Cloud campground, adjacent to Chadron State Park, and parked in a parking pad at a campsite.  We were in the car with the windows up. I recall the exact campsite.  It was a full moon on a fall night in September of 2003. The grass was still green.   This location is in the Pine Ridge, an escarpment, a part of Nebraska National Forest, just adjacent to Chadron State Park. We were parked facing up a ridge. We had been sitting for about a half an hour, when uphill in an area clear from some trees (this area is mostly covered by ponderosa pine trees), about 40 ft away we saw something on two feet run across our view out the front window, had to be running at least 30 miles an hour.  From the silhouette that we saw, it was very tall, not exceptionally bulky.  It had a rangy or sinewy build and looked muscular from the silhouette. It was a full moon, but there are no lights in or around this campground. It ran by way to fast to notice any hair features. We all looked at each other, like, ""What the f*** was that"".  We were all bewildered, and my girlfriend was really scared. I definitely knew we had witnessed something extraordinarily strange, and we got the hell out of there. We didn't even go around the loop to turn around because that was toward where it was running. Note that we knew there was no one at all parked or camping up there while we were there because we went around the loop upon entering.  We went back there the next day during the daylight to see where it would have been running.  There is a lot of brush, grass, stumps, and bushes where this thing was running through, and in my opinion, there is no human that can run that fast through there even in the daytime. I've told people I might have seen Bigfoot, but like most people, they just think I'm full of it.  I don't lie, and I would never have anticipated seeing something like that. As to my knowledge at that point, there were reports of Bigfoot in the Pacific Northwest area, not Nebraska.  I camped at the campground last summer with my current girlfriend.  Didn't see anything unusual, but got really bad vibes after revisiting my past memory.  We were the only one's camping out there.  Every other time we went camping out there it was with multiple people.","From Chadron, you head south on US hwy 385.

"[Editors note regarding classification of this report: This report is  Class B for two reasons:  1) It was not written by the actual witness, and 2) the figure was distant -- 300-400 yards.] I am writing this on behalf of my father-in-law.  On October 29, 2006 he, his wife, and a friend were hiking on the lookout trail in Chadron State Park.  Walking east, they came to a place where the trail takes a sharp turn to the south.  As they rounded the turn, my father-in-law’s friend looked towards the north and noticed someone, or something, standing on top of a limestone ridge about 300 to 400 yards away.  He stopped my father-in-law (my mother-in-law was walking a bit ahead of the two of them) and pointed the figure out to him.  Even from that distance, they could tell that there were some unusual features about the figure.  It was unusually tall and covered from head to toe in black fur.  They watched it for five minutes as it stood on the ridge and swayed back and forth before it casually walked behind a limestone outcrop and disappeared into the pine forest. They have no idea what this creature is that they witnessed.  The only reasonable explanation we could come up with is that since it is so close to Halloween, someone was running around in the forest in a gorilla costume.

"This happened in the spring of 1975 in Pennsville N.J.  This part of town backed up to a wooded area that in turn merged with the wildlife refuge at Finns Point.  I lived in an apartment complex that backed up to the woods.  I was eleven  years old at the time but remember it like yesterday.  I was just after dark and I was taking the garbage out to the dumpster.  Two friends of mine came running from behind the building in a panic.  I ask what was wrong and they said they had seen a huge whitesh covered creature at the edge of the woods.  These kids were a year or two younger then me.  Me being the older decided to get my fathers 12 volt spotlight and take a look. As we made our way to the woods about 65 feet behind the nearest apartment, my flashlight caught a pair of glowing red eyes. About fifty feet from the edge of the woods.  There appeared to be a large creature on two legs behind a stand of trees.  The hair on my neck stood up and we all ran to tell our parents.

"April 29 2006 about 630pm I just left the Livingston mall and was heading home but got all turned about since I don't go up that way very often. Anyhow I was figuring that I was north of rt 78 and just kind of ""Lewis and Clarked"" it toward home via the mirror compass in my car and made the first left southbound that I could once I realized I was heading west and didn't recognize any landmarks. I turn down this road and notice some construction equipment not far off into the trees on the right side of the road. I was driving slower than normal being unfarmiliar with the area and since I kept peeking at the compass to make sure I was still southbound (looking back it must have been overcast since I would have just used the location of the sun as a reference to direction). As I was driving along I caught movement out of the corner of my eye and saw a young deer (judging by size) bolt out of the trees across the road from left to right about 100-200 feet in front of my car. I just took my foot off the gas and didn't need to brake, then I looked left for followers and saw what appeard to be a hunter in a dark colored ghillie suit burst from the trees after the deer. I couldnt make out any details of the face feet or hands but he/it was only around 6 feet tall or so and I'd estimate the low 200lb range but was unusually fast especially for someone dressed like that. The second thought in my head since I fish and shoot a bit was that it couldn't possibly be legal to hunt around that area since its fairly close to residential zones. Then I noticed that the hunter had no weapons in his hands. I got up to the spot where they crossed and looked right and noticed that the biped (hunter) actually closed ground on the deer and was still in pursuit. I don't know if the deer stopped to look back at some point as they some times do but this thing was in a full tilt sprint over what I would assume to be uneven ground and didn't stumble once. I didn't hear or smell anything since I had my roof up and AC & radio on at the time. All of this happened I would estimate in less than 20 seconds total.",I don't know the name of the road I was originally traveling on but I made a left onto what I was later told was Kennedy parkway southbound this is the road where the crossing occurred.,Essex County,New Jersey,Spring,Report 16604: Possible sighting by motorist at dusk outside Livingston,40.77545,-74.3516,12/17/2006,16604,Class B,dr5punfy4n,56.57,53.195,49.82,32.63,0.64,0.26,0.9,0,0,,1019.97,Partly cloudy throughout the day.,2,10,227,2.34

"On a friday night in October of 1969 at 9:30pm,  me and another person were sitting in a car on Serviss Ave in North Brunswick, New Jersey. I was 15 years old at the time, and had just come home from a night out. We were parked on the right hand side of the dead end side of the block.  There are two houses on the right side of the street, then there is woods, and then Lawrence Brook. The moonlight was shining from behind the car towards the brook. While talking I glanced up towards the brook when I seen two red eyes in the middle of the road about 35 to 40feet away. Immediatly I said ""whats that thing in the road?"" The driver turned his headlights on and thats when we could see that this thing was not a dog or, person, or bear.  This thing was hunched down on the ground, and from the ground to the top of its head, it looked to be three and a half to four feet tall. After the headlights were turned on it sat there for about thirty second. We saw that it was hairy with three to four inch length reddish/brown hair and while standing it was about five feet tall. After the thirty seconds it stood up turned around and sort of waddled into the woods at a snails pace.  We guessed it was ticked off by the headlights, and good thing because we were scared and locked our doors. Once it went into the woods I exited the car and ran into the house. The driver threw the car into reverse backed out into Nassay Street, threw the car into gear and sped off down to Livingstone Ave. After I went inside my house I told my mother, whose answer was it must have been a dog or bear, and thought nothing of it.  This was a one time occurance and I have not seen anything like it since, but I did hear other things when I lived there.",Take Livingston Ave  to Nassau St go up one block to Serviss Ave make a left and a you are there.,Middlesex County,New Jersey,Fall,Report 2271: Night time sighting by New Brunswick resident near Lawrence Brook,40.478,-74.4611,12/11/2005,2271,Class A,dr5n38g16w,38.56,32.735,26.91,22.96,0.77,0.41,0.37,0.0005,0.39,snow,1003.75,Mostly cloudy starting in the afternoon.,2,7.05,246,1.75
"It was about three or four months (April or May) ago in the late afternoon, about 5-ish when my brother and I and a few friends were hanging out on our back deck. My brother saw it first. I saw nothing until my brother gave me a better point of reference, then I saw it. It was sitting on a large rock on the hill side, a grey ape-like creature. My brother went and grabbed his BB gun. He took a shot in the general direction of it. It was seated in profile to and turned its body to look at us. It then got up and climbed a large rock face (about six to ten feet high) behind it. It was climbing hand over hand like a man or ape would. Once it reached the top it walked off over the ridge and out of sight.

"My wife and I were hiking at Wildcat Ridge Wildlife Management Area in northwestern New Jersey on the afternoon of March 11th 2006.

"It was at least 2:00 am, in January or Februrary. The temprature was in the low teens. I was dropping a friend off at his home, the back of which was separated from the Highway (Rt.72) by about 150 to 200 yards of woods and a dirt road. There are no homes or streetlights on this part of Rt.72. The east side of Rt.72 is completely untouched woods for miles into Burlington county. This area was the end of a development that had never been finished.  Work stopped in the late 1970's, as part of the Pinelands Preservation Act. There was a dirt road about 30 yards behind the house,which connected to the East into a grid of unfinished, unpaved roads. At that time his house was the last house on that road, completely surrounded by woods. We were talking beside the car under the streetlight for at least 20 minutes, when we both heard a woman screaming.  It sounded like it was coming from the unpaved road behind his house. We both thought someone was in trouble, so we ran inside his house and grabbed a flashlight, knife, and a hatchet.  We ran into a trail along the right side of the house, (south-east) which led out to the dirt road. We could hear the screams getting louder and more to our right in the woods.| We were only about 40 paces into the woods, when I started feeling very uneasy, and I started to realize that this wasn't a woman screaming. I could hear it now to my right, more like a loud whistling now (not ahead in the dirt road like I had thought) about 15 yards away. We both stopped and listened for a few seconds, my friend had the flashlight scanning the woods which was new growth oak saplings, blueberry bushes (waist high) and 12' to 14'ft. scrubby pine saplings(20 years old?). I could hear it heaving as it breathed in and exhaled out with a very loud high pitched whistling, we couldn't see anything but It was very close to our right as we faced southeast -- within 10 yards. My friend immediately turned toward me and said ""that ain't no girl screaming"" and quickly moved past me back toward the house. I was standing still and listening, it was still screaming right at us. At this point I knew it wasn't a girl at all, more like a loud whistling is how I could best describe it. There was no noise other than the screams. There was no movement at all. No sound of struggle. I thought that it might be a wounded animal, like a deer or something. It was so loud and the deep breathing noises were from a much bigger animal than a fox. I could distinctly hear it breathing in and out rapidly to make the screaming noise.  I remember thinking that it's dangerous to be this close to a large wounded animal.  It was not like anything I had ever heard in my life. I turned and headed back, looking and listening. It was still screaming, but did not follow. We immediately called the police and reported it. Within 15 minutes we went back outside, now the screams were further toward the south-east, very faint now. It had definitely moved off quickly. The screams faded totally within 10 minutes. We listened for at least another 45 minutes but it was gone. I don't know what the police had done after we'd called. I had always thought it was a wounded animal of some kind.",,Ocean County,New Jersey,Winter,Report 12825: Possible vocalizations heard in undeveloped section of Ocean County,39.7384,-74.2975,11/13/2005,12825,Class B,dr54j64hyy,61.55,59.05,56.55,48.9,0.79,0.19,0.42,0,0,,1024.06,Partly cloudy starting in the evening.,3,8.54,204,6.56
"2 weeks ago i went into the pine barrons in manchester nj ,deep in forest to shoot a pistol. i left the gun in the car and scoped out the area before i started shooting. i started down a trail and when i turned the corner i heard heavy heavy footsteps run away from me and smell a skunky/homeless person type oder. i looked around area but saw nothing. then i walked in another direction and found a stream or pond.  then something threw a rock into the water making a good size splash. i now went back to the truck and got my gun when i went back to the trail. i saw nothing but thought this might be a bigfoot. couldnt stop thinking about it so i went back a couple days later with a bigger gun and an axe. when i got to the spot where this hapened i heard a loud call like choom choom choom choom. this startled me and i cocked the hammer. i then heard footsteps coming tawards me in the thick vegitation. it came within 15 feet away and stopped. i could not see it through the brush. with my gun pointed in its direction it threw a large stick that landed along side of me.  i said ""hello ?""  any body there, but no reply. i almost emptyed the gun into the bush but desided not to because i cuoldnt see the creature. i could smell it ,feel it, here it, and it threw something at me twice! i backed off and walked back to my truck the whole time ready to shoot if it atacked me.when i reached the truck this thing let out another call only much louder and much closer choom choom many times. a small bird on a tree branch began to act crazy. i took this warning and left. this sunday i went back with food, i took food to the spot where it threw the stick and backed away. then i heard some vocalizeations and got one of them on mini disc recording. sounds kinda like / coo coo kaa kaakaa coo coo ka kakka. went back to the trail to see if food was gone and was met by more stange bird behavior. many birds fleww rapidly out of trail as if some thing scared them out. when i looked down the trail i heard a loud snap of a tree or branch being broken. i backed away and soon after heard some low moans and groans, much too low to be a person. i also smelled the same oder again. this thing has an exeptional abilty to hide. all three times it was very close to me but for some reason i could not see it. i am convinced this is a sasqatch or more than one of them. i can take you or researchers to this place in nj pine barrons. this story is not a hoax and i dont beleive a person would be dumb enough to throw sticks and rocks at a man with a gun! i saw alot of good size trees (5or6inchdiameter) broken in half.",Edited out at the request of the witness.,Ocean County,New Jersey,Summer,Report 15062: Possible intimidation in the Pine Barrens,39.934,-74.3966,7/27/2006,15062,Class B,dr555jf03t,89.01,80.445,71.88,71.5,0.79,0.42,0.08,0.0055,0.65,rain,1014.63,Rain overnight.,6,8,208,3.63
"Even after all of these years, I still find it difficult to discuss what exactly I saw.    I still vividly remember the encounter and how terrified my friend and I were afterwards.  It’s amazing how time slows during intense moments, every detail is burned to memory, but in actuality only several seconds passed.  To be honest, I don’t know exactly what I saw that summer evening long ago.  As a child growing up, we were taught in school the legends surrounding the Jersey Devil and weird happenings in the Pine Barrens.  Hopefully this story won’t be viewed as lore that the region is famous for.  The only thing I can say for sure is, it really did happen and I will do my best to portray the event as I remember it. I grew up in a middle size town, a few miles from both the Jersey shore and the edges of the Pine Barrens.  My neighborhood & town were undergoing a growth spurt and wooded areas where I played as a kid were now strip malls or homes.  My house was on a corner lot and the neighbor’s house directly in front was a summer cottage (they were not there at the time).  I was 18 in 1989 and recently graduated from high school, with a strict midnight curfew.  My friend dropped me off on time with the passenger side of the car facing the front of my house.  I was outside of the car talking to Scott through the passenger side window, when we both heard a rustling sound near the trees on the corner of my neighbor’s property, about 30 feet away.  There was a street light on the opposite corner, and I could not make anything out beyond it.  We didn’t think much of it and continued to talk.  The rustling returned a little louder, and with a sound that I remember as something being dragged on concrete such as a stick. At this point I asked Scott if he saw anything over there.  At first he replied no, then he hesitated and said he sees something like a big dog that is sitting by the trees.  Not wanting to be bit by some rabid dog, I got in the car.  We went up the road and turned the car around on the opposite intersection.  Once around, we were facing my house, and there was what appeared to be a large grayish dog directly under the street lamp.  We started moving very slowly towards my house, and as we got closer it really didn’t appear to be like any dog I had every scene before.  When we were about 50 feet away, I turned to Scott and asked him to turn on the high-beams.  It is here where things happened very quickly, and I will try to capture it as best I can.  To our horror, what we thought was a large dog stood up and began to run on two legs.  It crossed the car and ran on an angle at first towards the middle of my house, but then quickly changed course and went around the dark side of my house.  We were both yelling, “what the h**l, was that” repeatedly.  The creature was very tall, his head was taller then the top of the windows on the house so I estimate around 8-feet.  He appeared to be a light gray in color, but it could have been the lights reflecting off his hair.  His arms were long and lanky, and sort of swayed forward and aft as he ran.  The creature had amazing speed/agility, and ran with what one would consider to be an odd gait.  His head was tilted forward and he might have been slightly hunched over.  His head swayed between looking forward and looking at us.  I will never forget the way his eyes reflected in the headlights.  The total time we had eyes on the creature was between 3-5 seconds.  Once he disappeared, the car accelerated around the corner and Scott slammed on the brakes.  Expecting to see the creature in the headlights, there was nothing but dark road…..he was gone. Not wanting to get out of the car we proceeded to Scott’s house a few miles away.  After a quick phone conversation with my parents, they ordered me home.  They were waiting out front when we got there, and we tried to explain what we saw.  My parents would hear none of our tale and assumed we were either drunk, or on drugs.  We were both rather shaken by the event, and my parents began to question their original assessment.  Over time came the inevitable ridicule of family and friends, and with their mocking I never really wanted to discuss this with anyone again. It took years before I was comfortable being alone, especially at night.  After spending time in the military, I came to the realization that he was as scared of us, as we were of him.  While I no longer have the fear, there isn’t a day that has gone by without me thinking of that night.",Residential neighborhood that is on the outskirts of the Pine Barrens.,Ocean County,New Jersey,Summer,Report 24738: Man recalls incident years before among homes near Brick,40.053,-74.1301,1/25/2009,24738,Class B,dr57c5kjek,29.38,24.435,19.49,3.16,0.43,0.15,0.98,0,0,,1027.19,Mostly cloudy in the evening.,3,10,300,2.31
"I don't know what I saw, but I have been hunting the woods of New Jersey for over 16 years, and I have never come across a thing like this. I got to my tree stand just before light as I do every time I hunt the mornings.  It was the rut, when bucks chase does to mate.  So the woods had a musky ordor to it.  But this was a smell that was differnt than the smell of deer urine.  This smell was more strong and foul. I hunted the morning but didn't see a deer.  Around 10 oclock I called my buddy who already got down that I was getting down.  He told me he was going to get breakfest.  So I got down and slowly hunted back to the truck.  I took the long way back on an old logging trail.  As I hit the logging trail that strong ordor came back.  I thought that maybe I should knock an arrow.  As I began to knock the arrow I felt that a deer stepped out onto the trail, but it wasn't a deer, I don't know what it was it wasn't a bear either. It looked at me , stopped for a second and turned back and walked back from where it came from.  It was about seven or eight feet tall about four or five hundred pounds may be more with long dark hair and short brown hair on his neck and head.  I paused for a second thinking may be this was a joke be played on me, but my buddy said he left to get food and he is no where near as big as the thing I just saw.  I called my buddy but our phones were out of range.  I ran out of the woods in the opposite direction as the thing. I thew my bow and nap sack of so I could run faster.

"Me and 2 friends were walking up the gas pipeline to fish a natural spring on the mountain, now privately owned by a hunting and fishing club. As we crested our first hill, all three of us all stopped at the same time. We saw a Bigfoot about 200 ft up the pipeline. I would estimate it to be over 7ft tall, brown and very shaggy.

"I work for (removed at request of witness). The headquarters dispatcher reported some customers were without water in the Rocksprings community. I responded and went up to the storage tank site which is located approximately 1 1/2 miles Northwest of the Sagebrush Bar. I checked the tank level and found them to be empty so I proceeded back towards Highway 264, the road to the tanksite is a dirt road. I was about 150 yards from the highway, the only light was from my unit's headlights shining straight down the road. My mind was traveling around the water system thinking about the scenarios that would be causing this water outage.About 20 yards from the truck I saw something walk out from behind a Juniper tree that is located on the west side of the dirt road. Right when it stepped out into the lights of the truck, it hesitated and it looked towards me,I stopped the truck at that moment. It then started to walk faster, picked up it's stride a little more. It took about 4 steps walking across that road, it did not cross the road in a straight manner, it crossed at an angle on the road and walked behind another Juniper tree that is located on the East side of the dirt road. I had stopped the truck as soon as it had stepped out onto the road, my visual contact time with what I now refer to as ""the Creature"" was about 15 seconds. I waited there to see if it would come back out or if I could see any type of movement, I did not see any. I sat there for awhile thinking,what did I just see ? My mind went through an elimination process, I thought, that was not a horse, a cow, a deer or an elk, 4 of the large animals that are prevalent in this area. The creature had a shiny brown hairy coat, it was approximately 7 feet tall, it's face was like a monkey's and the eyes were big and black, like a big teardrop shape. it's head was small and it came to a long point towards the back. The torso was skinny, narrow shoulders, the arms and legs were about 3to 4 inches in diameter, it had elbows and knees but I did not see any hands, fingers or a type of foot or toe structure. The hand and foot area were just rounded off, like nubbed. The only closest description would be like the way an amputee's arm or leg might look, rounded off.It took about 4 steps for it to cross the road,it's gait was long. I sat there about 30 seconds wondering if I should start driving forward towards the highway or turn around and use the other turnoff further west. Also at that time, a chill came over me and I hurriedly locked both doors, I did not even want to look out towared my side window because a fear had come aver me at that point. I just revved the engine and drove fast towards the highway. I drove fast down to the pumphouse and found the problem, it was a power outage to the wellsite. I had to go back to Ft. Defiance to pick up some fuses, I did not want to go back out to the area alone, so I had the dispatcher contact the Electric Line standby and I went back to the well along with him and  I got the well back in service. The next day, my co-worker and I went back to the site and found the footprints, he had a digital camera and he took some photos of the footprints. The footprints were about 4 to 5 ft apart, we tracked it to the East into the brush area.

"My uncle, my six year old cousin, and I were on one of our little weekly expeditions to explore the surrounding mountains in Winnemucca, Nevada. We were walking up the foot of a mountain on the ridge of a wash and there was still about a foot and a half of snow on the ground when my cousin said that she saw a guy standing on top of the mountain and I said ""There's no one up there, it's to far from any civilizations. It's probably just a juniper bush."" But about five minutes later, our 95 pound Doberman/Greyhound mix made a mad dash underneath the truck by the foot of the mountain. (And our dog was not one to be scared off easily, it scare's away anything that comes close to the house, and it even took on a mountain lion once, it has the scars on it's underbelly to prove it.) Just about the time me and my Uncle looked up towards where my cousin was pointing, we heard a low, droning howl and what I thought was the juniper bush, was animated now, walking downwards, and swaying side to side slightly. It spooked me and my uncle because on the way up we saw a totally decimated cow carcass! About that time we headed out to the truck because we were pretty shaken up by what we had just seen.

"It was Saturday, July 16, 2011, about 12:30 a.m. early last Saturday morning. We were going to the Chuska Mountains on the Navajo reservation for a family reunion. We just left the main paved highway through Narbona Pass, Indian Service Route 32, Hwy 134, between Sheep Springs, NM and Crystal, NM. We went south on a dirt road, Indian Service Route 32, into the Chuska Mountains. we were about 5-8 miles into the mountains, when we came upon a small hill that curved towards the east, then to the south. As we approached the hill to go up, the road quickly turned right/south. As we reached the top, we saw the full moon and it lit up a flat green pasture that was on top of the hill. As we made the turn to the right/south I noticed a big black figure standing. As I looked at it, it stood with the full moon behind it, so that all I could see was a black outlined form. I kept my eyes on the figure while making the turn right. I said to my wife,  ""Did you see that?!"" She said, ""What?"" I said, ""Something is standing over there by the road."" As I looked, I noticed that the figure was standing by a small pond, which was about 10-15 feet from the road. I could see the figures reflection in the pond, along with the full moon. I would say when I first saw it, it was about 75 feet away. As we got closer, our headlights turned to the right, away from the black figure, but I still could see it, because the moonlight was so bright. It just stood there, still, as if it was waiting for us to leave. I told her I was going to pull the truck onto the edge of the road. The road being dirt, and because of the rain, it had been plowed, so there was a ridge of dirt on both sides of the road. So, I pulled the vehicle, left towards the ""Bigfoot"" to flash my headlights on it. As my headlights flashed the ""Bigfoot"" it turned. We could see the legs (two) turn, the arms (two) turn, and it started running away from us up a small hill into the trees. It was a quick smooth run, I mentioned to her that it ran, Ninja-like, smooth and stealthy. In less than 5-6 seconds it was in the trees. As it was turning and running, we didn't see any clothing, buttons shining from the headlights/moonlight, we saw a huge mass, a body running on two legs, we never saw any eyes. We noticed the legs and arms, and for sure it ran on two legs up the hill. We were about 30 feet away from it when it ran up the hill. We could see that it was not a bear or human. It stood at least 7-8 feet tall. It was wider and taller than a person. After it ran away, we were in shock, we sat quietly in the truck, still for about 15 seconds. Then, all of a sudden my oldest daughter, screamed and said,  ""Daddy what was that."" I was shocked that she was awake the whole time. I thought only my wife and I saw it. But, she was terrified, asking me, over and over, Daddy what was that. I couldn't say anything but tell her, it was a Bigfoot. My wife and I aren't crazy nor are we believers of Bigfoot until now. In fact, we were the biggest skeptics. But we can't deny what we saw. I have to believe it because it was real. My wife also admitted that she saw it too, as we first approached the hill, just like I did. She, just wasn't sure at the time if it was the same thing I saw. It was eerie and exciting at the same time. We also went back there on Sunday to look for tracks. There weren't any, the ground was extremely hard where it ran up the hill. Along the pond, we saw hoof prints from cows, dog prints, deer prints, no noticeably Bigfoot prints. By the way, the pond was only about 10-15 feet wide, it was just runoff of rain water, so it isn't always there during the year. It seemed to me, that it was not wanting to be seen. I believe if I didn't turn my headlights towards him it would have probably stood there until we passed by, then it would have left. I think it was very intelligent. Because it watched us. And even before I could get the headlights turned onto him, he had already started to turn away from us. It had to have known what we were going to do next. That is probably why we didn't see any eyes. I have lots of stories from my grandma about Bigfoot. She said they have been here since the beginning of time. And, that they were like us, living among us, until they saw ""humans"" start to fight among themselves. Then, they didn't want any part of us anymore, so they went into hiding. They, know that if they kill a human or make contact with one, they know that nothing good will come of it. So, that is why they stay in hiding.","We were on a dirt road, Indian Service Route 32, going South into the Chuska mountains.

"We hear screams almost every night throughout the spring and summer months. This particular incident occured after midnight, approximately 1:00am. I was awakened by all the neighborhood dogs barking. Even my dog was barking outside my window. Suddenly my dog began to cry. I sat up and walked into the living room and opened the sliding door enough to peek out side and listen to what the dogs were barking at. When I heard a loud scream like screeching then it turned into a loud holler. This screaming sounds went on for about ten minutes and came closer to my home. I then closed the sliding door and continued to peek out my living room window. I saw this tall hairy thing like a man standing next to the other window looking inside my home.

" Around 11:00p.m. my sister in-law ran in to my mother in-law's house from outside and said that she seen something very tall walking on the trail below the house. She said it was walking back and fourth on the trail below before it came up to the house and stood at the corner looking at them sitting there. That's when her and her friends ran inside and told me. We checked outside around the front but saw nothing. So they went in her room after that.  Me and my girlfriend stayed in the living room and watched TV. When we heard some noise in the dinning room I said,""what was that?"".  She said I dont know so I jumped up to see. Some of the girls came out to see what the noise was. It was like somebody throwing stuff around in the room.  When I got to the dining room I saw a large hand reaching in the window. It reached across a table by the window and pulled out a bowl that had some food in it. We all got scared and I called the conservation office. Nothing else happened after that. This thing has been hanging around this town [Mescalero] for about 2-3 years now. About 2 years before that, a bigfoot followed my brother in-law home from a friends house about 12:00am He saw it down the road, about 150 yards away. He got scared and ran home.  When he got to the door he started pounding on it. He didn't know it had followed him, but when he looked behind him he saw that the bigfoot was standing there looking at him, about 10 feet away. When they opened the door my brother ran inside. He said the thing left after about 5 minutes. Another sighting was about a year ago at the same house. My mother in-law went out to get her clothes off the line. There was snow on the ground. It was about 8:00am. She saw two sets of tracks, a very large set and a smaller set, like it had a smaller one with it. The tracks went between the house and the clothes line. Some of her clothes were on the ground.

"I am new to this stuff, so I won't even try to cover everything related to this trip. That's for others to talk about. I can tell about what I observed and heard. There were about twenty five people at the BFRO's Jemez Mts. expedition in northern New Mexico a few weeks ago. Several things happened during the expedition. I'll only describe what I observed personally, from where I was standing or sitting at the time. If you were on this trip, and you don't see me mentioning the other incidents that happened closer to your positions, then please write them up yourself. This is what I personally experienced. Pam R. Albuquerque, New Mexico [Portions below are edited by BFRO editors] Thursday, August 11th: Day : Bright and Sunny I, along with my sister our two boys, followed the expedition group along mountain roads near the first base camp to help find views over elk grazing areas where the guides could blast and listen. Several good spots were found and noted by GPS units. All of were at high elevations and had breathtaking views across vast mountain forests and canyons. The guides needed to see as many of these locations as possible while it was still light, so we kept moving most of the time. We explored these mountains for hours and only passed two other vehicles and one ranch house. Night : Rainy and Windy Most people headed out for the view locations visited during the day.   My sister and another lady remained at the base camp to rest and listen for sounds in that area. Blasting at first location :  Nothing heard. There was a lot of wind and rain from the west.  No animals were heard responding to the blasts, not even coyotes or owls.  The decision was made to move around to the east facing slope, away from the winds. Blasting at second location : We heard some things. Unlike at the first blasting location, there was very little wind and rain on this side of the mountain. The guides said the east side of the mountain would get the usual afternoon rain coming up from the Gulf of Mexico, but it was pretty sheltered from the storms blowing in from the west. There was only a slight drizzle once we got up on the east slope, and there were patches of fog hanging in the gullies. My two boys (Nick and Will), and I drove past the blasting site (#2) about 1/4 mile (using left fork in road at blasting site). One boy was asleep in the bed of the pickup truck. Around the first curve, the headlights lit up a small cloud of dust swirling in the road, as if an animal has just got off the road in a hurry. We drove slowly through the dust swirl. The ground was too rocky and gravelly for tracks. Not far beyond the swirl of dust, a bank of thick fog covered the road. We drove into the fog bank and pulled up to a clearing on the left, about 1/4 mile up the road from the blasting crew. We stopped and shut off all lights. Both boys were in the bed of the pickup truck and I was inside with the windows down. I heard nothing for a while. After a few minutes, the boys said they heard the sounds of sticks breaking inside the tree-line. The fog was too thick for us to see inside the tree-line. The source of the sound did not seem to move. There were occasional branch snapping sounds coming from one direction. This lasted for about two minutes. We could hear the blasts from down the road, but heard no responses to the blasts. After about an hour of hearing nothing more, we drove back down to the blasting team.  At the blasting site I continued to listen for several minutes. I was very tired by now and cold.  I needed to relieve myself, and I'm female, so I turned on a flashlight and marched up the road just far enough away to find some privacy. I walked in the opposite direction of where we had seen the dust swirl in the road. When I rounded the first curve in that direction, I was ""hit"" with a series of low pitched growls (about 7 or 8) that seemed to come from the tree line directly ahead of me. I stopped for a few seconds to make sure of what I was hearing. The growls were distinct, but very low pitched and just barely audible. I could feel the hum of the growls in my chest area. It seemed like I could feel the sounds better than I could hear them. Then, there was a louder growl which I could hear much better. That caused me to run back to the truck and my boys.  I went toward the truck and whispered to Nick and Mike that I had been growled at. We walked back toward where I had heard the growls. On the way down Mike stopped me and said he saw movement in the brush. I heard branches snapping in the same direction. The three of us moved back to the truck and tried to call the others via the walkie-talkie. As I fiddled with the radio I heard loud moos and bellows from some cows in a gully below us. I had the impression that they were spooked by something. I got in the pickup truck to warm up. Nick walked with Mike Sedillo and the other guys down to where the leg of a young deer was found in the road. Will and I sat bundled up in the vehicle with the windows down. After 20 or 30 minutes we heard a wild clamor of fighting coyotes in the woods uphill from us. Among the fray of coyote sounds was something odd.  It was a strange yowling. It stood out among coyotes'  yips, yaps, and snarls. It sounded more like a human or an ape. This went on for about 45 seconds and then died down. I think a few people near the blasting area recorded it. [See the link to the sound clip at the bottom of the page] People were spread out at bit. Other people heard sounds that I did not hear from where I was. Many were distant sounds, some were closer. There were lots of different animal noises in this area (frogs, coyotes, owls, cattle, elk, etc.) compared to almost no animal sounds near the first blasting area. It was getting very cold around 2:30 am.  The plan for the next day was discussed. It was obvious that there was a higher concentration of animals in this area compared to the first area. About six or seven people, including me, insisted that we also heard something that was not a 'known' animal. Everyone agreed that we should focus on this area, and move the base camp closer to this area. Friday morning, August 12 : Packed up Base Camp #1. Everyone helped pull up camp near the first blasting location, and relocate it closer to where the sounds were heard the night before.  Friday night, August 13 : At Base Camp #2 the guides recommended that we blast Tahoe screams and Ohio howls and some other sounds from base camp that evening, because the sounds would echo through the area where we were the night before. They said if what we heard the night before was actually a sasquatch, the blasts would likely attract it toward the base camp. After the second blast a short but distinct ""return call"" was heard. It sounded very similar to the Tahoe recording, which is what they were using to blast with at that moment. Some of the other people who heard it said (over the walkie-talkies) that it might have been a loud echo of the Tahoe recording. They radioed for Ed to blast it again, to see if they could hear the ""echo"" again.  After a few tries, there was agreement that what was heard originally could not have been an echo, because we could not reproduce it. Within 30 minutes or so, some of the other people said they could hear something walking in the woods on the north side of camp. There was some talk about how to respond to this, so as not to scare off whatever was stalking the camp, but rather to encourage it to come closer. I didn't get to hear those sounds. My own tent was about 100 yards away from that group (Los Alamos team). What they heard at that point, and later on, is for them to tell. Saturday morning, August 12: We returned to blasting area #2 during the day and searched the area where Mike and Nick said they had been paralleled through the woods by something. We found some freshly overturned aspen trees and cow bones. We also found the spot where I think the growls had come from.  Lots of possible impressions. The ground and leaf litter was too thick to make any identification of tracks.  Saturday around sundown, August 12: The group I was with drove up the road beyond blasting area #2 and dropped off five of us (Nick, Will, Mike, Pam (me), and Brooke) to walk the road downhill.  The drivers moved the vehicles ahead to make various sounds from their positions. They gave warnings over the radios, then made a particular sequence of sounds which they have heard in other areas. We could hear it clearly from our position. Everyone stood still and silent and listened for responses. There was no immediate response. After about twenty minutes the sequence was repeated. Within a few seconds we heard at least two faint, womanish shrieks in the distance. The shrieks frightened my extremely skeptical sister. We assured her that those noises were peanuts compared to the ones the night before. We listened for another twenty minutes and heard nothing. It started to rain so we drove back down to Base Camp #2. It was not far down the hill. Blasts made from the base camp could be heard from this area, so we figured we could lure it toward the base camp by blasting a few times from there. We went back and blasted from base camp. For about an hour we heard no responses, so we turned in for the night. While in our tents, the four of us, who were camped farthest away from the other tents, heard whistle noises coming from the woods on the slope above us. There was more than one whistler and there might have been three. They were not whistling continuously. It was an occasional back and forth exchange, but this went on for about an hour and we probably heard about 30 or 40 different whistles. They were definitely not elk whistles, and were too variable in tone and pitch to be bird. They sounded more like short, soft human whistles calling back and forth to each other as they moved to different parts of the hillside. I fell asleep eventually but then awoke to the sound of two loud, heavy footsteps directly outside the tent. I thought at first that someone from the group had silently approached our tent and expected to hear someone call our names. I whispered to my sister, ""Did you hear that?"" She tapped me on the shoulder twice, which I thought was a signal to go back to sleep. As it turns out, she was trying to tell me that she had heard it as well and wanted me to simply be quiet and listen some more. I  went to sleep, and heard no more sounds that night. The next day several people took time to look around the hillside where the whistles were heard. Several possible tracks had been found on a different part of that hillside the day before. More were found on Sunday. Bill and Brooke from San Francisco cast a few those. Some brush structures were found and photographed.

"[Note - At their request, the witness's names were removed from this report.] It was back a few years ago when we were still scouting put-ins and take outs on the non- commercial sections of the San Juan River. We would drive these narrow two track roads to find river access. And then float and scout these sections accordingly. We could not find any real information either in print or on the web about the river from Shiprock, Nm,  down to Montezuma Creek Utah. We had to explore it ourselves via kayaks and canoes. Nowadays, we have a river company through the Navajo Tribe, and take people down this sections all the time. We found a put-in at mile ten just out side of Shiprock. It's about ten bumpy bad road miles to the river, but provided a good launch area. We used my truck to put -in with the boats. We had already dropped a truck off at Four Corners Bridge. (some 17 river miles away) The day was fairly warm for early March, mid 60's I think. We did the run in under 5 hours. We loaded the boats and gear in the truck,and headed back over to pick up my truck. It was getting dark by the time we got there. My ex wife, and my partner pulled up out of the small canyon before me. We carry walkie talkies on the river and in our vehicles. I turned mine on, and told them to wait up. My partner replied ""sure no problem""--just then before he let go of the button, I heard XXX (my ex-wife) screaming. ""What's going on up there!"" I shouted through my walkie talkie. ""XXX sees somthing up by that old sheep corral, turn your bright's on, I can't see it because I'm trying to get outta here, and not reck this truck, she says look it's on your right, you'll be coming right up on it!"" Sure enough, I got right behind them, I saw the back of it as it turned in my headlights. A few swings of it's arms, and it was out of there. This was not what I expected to see at all. I would put it at about 7 feet tall, skinny, gray in color, arms past the knees, like looking at the back of a grinch head-pointy. XXX got a better look at it then I did. She said it looked right at her. Does not much want to talk about it. J p.s.

"Big foot sighting Saturday June 15, 2002 At approximately 8:30 pm I was on my way back from a dinner with my grandfather Near Shiprock, NM.  While sitting on the passenger side of my mom's truck I was looking out the window. On state highway near crystal NM. before bowl canyon turn off.  At that moment I was feeling calm, bored and frustrated with trying to calm my younger cousin who was very hyper. So. while I was looking for something to amuse him I sighted something unusual moving, it was HUGE. It was as tall as the cedar trees that are around there. I was very scared and shaken when I saw it. I thought ""What the heck is that!"" It looked like a man but, as I was watching it I noticed it had hair covering its whole body with a mixture of grey/ dark brown and white on its chest. The head and the feet also the hands were all dark in color and the legs were dark grey. The face was lighter in color and when I saw the face it was turned toward my direction. The forhead was most unusual and it really stuck out with no neck. It had a little slump in the shoulder and its arm spanned down to its knees. It took large steps and its arms swung back and forth.

"My sister is in town visiting from Texas with my niece and nephew. She wanted to visit my grandmother's summer camp up in the Chuska Mountains before she headed back to Texas. We left on Friday the 5th of August from Albuquerque and headed through Farmington to Shiprock. We didn't arrive until about 2330 at the location of my grandmother's home which is abandoned now and dilapidated. The door faces east the back portion of the home the roof has collapsed. We set up camp in a clearing north of my grandmother's home near my aunt's home and my uncle's home, just to the west of the clearing and east of a small grove of pine trees. We finished setting up the tent about 0030 the 6th of August (Saturday morning) with the main tent door facing south and the other 3 small doors facing west, south and east. We ate a late dinner of warmed up hamburger patties my sister made earlier in Albuquerque. We finally bedded down about 0115. I was near the west door and then my mother, my niece and nephew and my sister was near the east door of the tent. We said goodnight goofing around saying ""good night John Boy"". It was then I shut off my cell phone to conserve the battery and it listed 0128. I settled in and looked up thru the rain cover, it has a clear plastic portion in the center of the tent and I couldn't see any stars because of the clouds. Also due to the rain cover I could not smell much from outside the tent. The outside of the tent you couldn’t see without a light source, the best you could see was about 2 feet in front of you and the rest was pitch black. About 15 minutes later I heard what I thought was leaves blowing from the northwest direction. The reason I thought it was leaves at first was because I only heard it when the wind was blowing from the southwest. When the wind started again I heard what sounded like leaves but then it occurred to me there are only pine trees around and only pine needles were on the ground. It came close to the tent still on the northwest side of the tent and bumped into the nylon rope used to secure the rain cover of the tent. I heard the nylon rope pull the rain cover and snap back. Then it moved to the door I was nearest. From there it walked around, even when the wind stopped blowing for about 30 seconds. The sound of the footsteps was muffled and was bi-pedal. Earlier (about an hour) there were dogs barking to the west on the other side of the lake, so I thought it was a dog at first, but it was walking on 2 legs. It then moved to the southwest portion of the tent but did not yank the other nylon rope staked down. It moved closer to the tent, near where there were 2 nylon belts for the rain cover staked down in the ground. It sounded like it squatted down and started scratching the rain cover. I heard about 10 scrapes or so, like it was wondering what this structure was made of. It must have pulled up the stakes up because when the wind blew that portion of the rain cover started flapping. I couldn't see any shadows from outside because of the overcast. It was still squatting by the corner when I heard a second set of footsteps to the southeast of the tent about ten feet away. This is when I got nervous because now there were two of these things outside the tent. I didn't hear the second one come close to the tent. About a minute later I heard rocks clicking from the northeast direction, but it was a distance away. I got more nervous thinking there might be three of those things out there, so I hit the panic button on my sister's SUV key chain. The alarm went off. That's when my sister woke up wondering why the SUV was beeping. I told her there's two of something outside the tent. I didn't hear the one near the tent (southwest) leave but the other started walking away and it stepped on a branch as it left. Then about 3 minutes later I heard the rock clicking again but this time from the southeast direction and this too sounded quite a distance from us. My sister couldn't hear the rocks clicking. She's a little hard of hearing but she did hear the branch breaking as one of them walked away. All of this occurred in about a 20 minute time frame. I waited for 10 minutes more but didn't hear anymore footsteps and I turned on my cell phone again to check my time which listed it as 0215. I stayed up for about 30 minutes and finally went to sleep. When morning came I heard my sister wake up her kids to head to the outhouse just west of our camp. I got up to see if there were any footprints. I didn't find any. The grass was growing randomly and was already trampled by us. This is when I found the tent stakes were pulled up about 4 inches from the ground. There were no marks on the tent where the scrapping occurred. Then I checked where I heard the second moving and found what looked like a footprint. There were outlines of toes facing south. The whole track looked about 8 inches long.  I compared it to my hand which measures 7 3/4 inches. We had breakfast and left the location about 1030. Before we left I took a look around and found 4 trees bent from about 4 feet from the ground.",[Removed],San Juan County,New Mexico,Summer,"Report 12271: Possible visitation at a camp, 10 miles northeast of Whiskey Lake.",36.14505,-108.8548,8/6/2005,12271,Class B,9w6tdun25m,66.88,61.375,55.87,50.38,0.72,,0.05,0.0004,1,rain,,Clear throughout the day.,0,,113,0.5

"A friend was visiting from out of town and so we decided to take advantage of the clear skies and mild temperatures and go for a road trip.  We had just been down near Window Rock, AZ and were heading back to Farmington, NM.   The easiest way to do so is going over Narbona Pass.  The speed limit on this road is 65 and I was travelling at 65 when coming around a corner just south of the picnic area (there is only one area that is located east just off the highway).   As I came around the corner I noticed something moving rapidly in a diagonal direction up the side of the hill just where the forest meets the meadows lining either side of the highway. It would be the east side of the road.  I slowed down and said to my friend ""Did you see that?!""  he had seen it as well.  I hit the brake to get another look but knew that by the time I backed up it would have been long gone. What we saw was larger than a black bear or elk.  Blackish-Brown hair that could be seen hanging from all over its body.  It was running on two legs up the hill.  It never looked over at us and we only saw its side and back.  Broad and at least 7 ft tall. We were both under the impression that we had startled it and it was quickly trying to get into the forest cover. We stopped a mile or two up the road where the road crosses this creek at an ancient lava flow.  The whole time we were out looking at rocks there was an eerie feeling that we were both getting that something was watching us.  We stayed around for an hour and when the sun started to get lower behind the mountain we decided it was best to leave.

It was upright but crouched over useing it's arms to propel itself across the road. This was no oversized monkey. It was dark, but it looked to be a dark brown color, and the body covered in a thick shaggy looking coat. It was roughly 5 foot in height hunched over. It's startling feature was it's broadness. We only saw a side and back  view, so we could not make out any frontal features. As we passed the point were we saw it crossing the road, we looked in both directions of where it had ran to, and from where it had come. Looking in the direction of where it had come we saw a dog standing at the edge of the property barking. There was no sign of the creature in the direction it ran.

"October 1994 wharton forest. I picked up my hunting buddy at his house and went to his hunting spot. When i parked to let him out we decided to waste some time and b.s. It was early morning,dark and very still. We stood outside the truck talking when something let go a roar that made the hair on my neck stand up.Whatever it was, it was about 50 yards away and it wasn't moving. We shined our flashlights in its direction but didn't see anything. We got in the truck and got out of there. It was loud,like a lions roar. In late october or early november the following year, we were hunting about a mile from where we heard the roar. I got into my tree stand one afternoon at about 2:30 and waited for the deer to start moving. We where hunting on a deadend road that stopped at a thick swamp. No wind and cruchy leaves perfect for listening for deer. Dusk was setting in when i heard something making alot of noise to my right. It sounded like someone shimmying down a pine tree. It began walking across in front of me but about 50 yards away. It was heading towards the road, then it went away from me. I thought there must be another hunter in the woods besides me. I listened to it walk and it changed direction and was now walking away from the road. I said to myself, this is a deer or a hunter who is disoriented. It now was walking towards me. I stood up and got my bow ready just in case. As it came into veiw [ at about 10-15 yards ] i could see it wasn't a deer, but it looked like a man dressed in solid black. I pulled out my flashlight shined it on him and whistled. It stopped mid-stride. I put the flashlight away and tied my bow on my string and lowered it down. I then got my light back out and looked for the guy. He was gone. I never heard him leave. By now it was dark as i climbed down from my stand. I walked through the woods to the road and headed for the truck. When i got to the truck i asked my hunting parner if he had seen anyone walk by or drive by and he said, no its just you and me here. I told him i thought i saw another hunter by my stand, and he was wearing all black. The more we thought about the more it didn't make sense.

"This sighting had happened when me and my girlfriend were driving on one of the dirt trails off Route 72.  We had just gotten on the trail and I wanted to stop for a second.  After being stopped for a few minutes, I looked up and noticed my girlfriend looked like she had just seen a ghost.  She said that she just saw something tall and light brown walk across the road we were on.  So I said it was probably just a deer or something. I got out and looked around, and I saw some bushes moving and heard some rustling.  As soon as I turned my head I saw this face of an animal about 6 feet high looking straight at me through this big pile of brush.  The face itself was black but the hair was a dark sandy to light brown color.  It looked like the face of an ape.  The hair on the top of its head was somewhat long. After looking at it for a few seconds I shook my head to see if i had seen what I thought I had, while I was doing so the animal had run away.  I saw it running for a second but then I turned back  to my car and got in.  Once I was in I asked her what she thought she saw.  She said that it was the same thing she had seen when we went camping six months prior to this. We went camping near Tuckerton but we had taken a detour to Apple Pie Hill.  There is a ranger lookout tower there, so went to the top and she looked down and said what the hell is that.  I pointed my flashlight in the direction but didn't see anything.  She said she saw something running in front of the tower and it looked like the same thing she had seen. But once I had gotten back into my car I looked around for it again but didn't see it.  So I put my window down and started driving, I could hear something running toward my car so I stopped and turned off my car again.  I still heard something coming my way, it sounded like a human or something running on two feet as opposed to a animal on 4 feet galloping through the woods.

Boundary Peak is the highest mountain in Nevada at over 13.000 feet. It is located in the White Mountains East of Bishop, California. One of my roommates is a loan executive for a bank in Idaho, and the other is a farmer. We left Boundary Peak trailhead on the last Saturday morning of July, 2004 around 0600 am. Around 2:00 p.m. we were several hundred feet from the summit of Boundary Peak. There were two climbers making their way down the trail towards us. The last 300 feet of the climb is steep with lots of obstacles, and the trail is very narrow. We waited at our location so that the two climbers combing down would have room to pass on the trail. As we were waiting I spotted a lone climber making his way across the rim rock trail between Montgomery Peak and Boundary Peak. He caught my attention, because he kicked a rock off the West side slope of the sheer rock cliff. When the two climbers reached our location I observed something moving south about 300 feet down from us in a large bowl. The movement was too fast to be another climber, because the area that it was in was full of small shale rock. This rock is extremely hard to walk in and keep your balance on the steep mountain side. There were also several large boulders in with the shale rock where the trail was that this climber was using. When I first observed this subject, I said out loud; ""Look at that guy go. He is wearing a funny hairy climbing suit."" My first thought was that he was some expert climber wearing a modern high tech climbing suit. All five of us looked at what I just pointed out, and there was a dead calm silence among us. We all sat there for about two minutes and watched as this creature made its way to the trees below us. While I was watching it, I made the listed observation: This creature would run on two legs upright until it came up on a large boulder, and then it would crawl over it on all four legs and run for a while on all four legs. After a short distance, it would stand back up on two legs and run until it came up to another obstacle. This creature was between 5' and 5'6"" tall. Its arms hung down to almost its knees. The head area appeared to have a long hair around the face and head. It appeared to be a light brown in color with darker hair around the head and groin area. Once it reached an area of heavy vegetation, we lost sight of it. It took over 90 seconds to reach the vegetation from the first place that we observed it. I asked the other climbers if they knew what it was that we just saw. They did not say anything. My first thought was that it looked like an orangutan. I told this to one of my friends and they replied, “Yeh, maybe it escaped from captivity...” Everyone left it at that and we all started back up the summit, while the other climbers made their way down. Before the other climbers left, I asked them where they were from and they said Southern California. As we were going back up I spotted the other lone climber crossing the divide between the peaks. He was about 1/2 mile south of Boundary Peak. I thought to my self that this climber might have scared the creature from his hiding place when he knocked a rock off the cliff. Once we were on the peak, the lone climber met up with us. He was an Asian male. I asked him if he saw anything down the South slope of the divide that he just came across. He said he didn't see anything (i.e. anything unusual). All three of us in our climbing party had cameras. They were all in our back packs when we observed the creature. I initially thought of trying to take my gloves off and taking off my pack to get my camera out. I realized that my camera did not have a zoom on it, and that a regular 35mm would only show a dark spot at a distance of over 300 yards. When I returned home I told a couple of my close friends about the creature that I saw. I did not want a lot of people to know about what I saw, because I did not want them to think that I was loosing it. In February of 2007 I bought 10 acres of land about 5 miles from the area that I saw the creature. I did not know it at the time, but this is where I am going to retire. I was talking to one of the local residence and I told them about what I saw up on the mountain. They did not seem surprised, and told me about a local prospector who saw something in the forest that scared him to the point that he does not want to talk about it ever again.

"My family had moved from the city of Rochester to Wolcott, a small town about 50 miles east of Rochester in July 2003. We were living in an old farmhouse on approx. 77 acres of woods & creeks near Lake Ontario. This incident happened sometime between the 18th-20th of September. My sister's birthday is the 20th and I recall a small group of family and friends were visiting the house for that occasion. My future-stepfather took a small group, including his brother, my four sisters, and a few other friends out for a ""tour"" of the property. I was not present, I had stayed behind at the house. As the group returned to the house, my stepfather lingered behind in an area of the property where a strip of woods runs between two fields. My stepfather was in the field closer to the house, we'll refer to it as field #1. He noticed to his left something in the woods and turned to see a tall, white, hair covered creature standing just off the path in the woods. He ran ahead and told his brother, but did not tell the rest of the group. His brother rushed into the house to get me, telling me that something was in the woods and I should come see. I followed him outside where my stepfather relayed the story to me and the three of us walked back to the area of his sighting. As my stepfather showed me the spot where the creature had been standing, we all noticed that the creature was still present, but had moved further back, to field #2. At this point, the three of us were standing in field 1 and looking through a small strip of trees at the creature in field 2, maybe 200 yards away or so. My observations of the creature are as follows: It was approximately 7' tall, covered in hair, white but with a dark area on the face, think and lanky, with a head that came to a slight conic shape. It was too far to distinctly see its face but there was a definite darker colored area where the face would have been. The creature was clearly observing us, as it paced back and forth, looking around trees, standing up taller, ducking down, etc. to get a better look at us. After approximately 45 seconds, the creature retreated to an area where we couldn't see it clearly. I walked through the trees into field 2 to get a better look at it, but it had disappeared. The area where it had been walking was matted down, but there were no distinct prints. Judging by nearby trees, I estimated its height to be 6.5 - 7 feet.","East on Route 104, near town of Huron.",Wayne County,New York,Fall,"Report 26566: Man observes tall, white hair-covered creature during a family gathering near Lake Ontario",43.27314,-76.89331,9/20/2003,26566,Class A,dr9q4m8h21,70.3,60.38,50.46,52.06,0.67,0.35,0.81,0.0007,1,rain,1020.92,Overcast in the morning.,5,10,286,1.64
"The town of Albion is small, there are woods, fields & streams just on the outskirts of town. With the time being around 2:00am in the morning, there were no sounds of any traffic or industrial sounds. The weather was excellent; no clouds, not the slightest breeze. My girlfriend and I had turned in for bed at around 1:30-1:45 am. We were talking to each other, just little chit chat when we both heard a far off howl/moan! At that time of night and that there was no wind to disturb the trees and hamper what we heard, it sounded like it came from the south maybe a mile or a mile and a half. The sound started low and kept going up in pitch for about 5 seconds. We both looked at each other and said ""What the hell was that?!"" Now what really freaked us out is that it did it again, only at around 6-7 seconds! It was like, ""Ooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh-----"" Now I consider myself an excellent observer with a very keen ear. I can hear things that most people either don't, or just overlook. What we heard was NOT anything mechanical nor was it a whistle. It sounded like it traveled over some distance; not like it was down the street. I am very fimiliar with all kinds of traffic noises that are associated with small towns. Even before we had heard it, we both had noticed how silent it was for quite some time. After the howl/moan, there was an echo. The sound went up in scale and didn't go down like a siren or anything like that. It wasn't a cry for help or a wolf nor any coyote (I have heard a coyote three times, once from only 200 yards)","The incident took place right in town, but being so early in the morning it was dead quiet; no traffic noise, no wind, nothing.",Orleans County,New York,Summer,"Report 7939: Powerful vocalizations heard near town of Albion, NY",43.2265,-78.1946,8/22/2002,7939,Class B,dr8muthktg,82.25,74.145,66.04,64.99,0.79,0.74,0.49,0.0008,1,rain,1016.09,Overcast throughout the day.,4,8.33,239,4.76
"Hi, in the end of Jan. 2003 my wife and I were spotlighting for deer and coyotes in Waterport NY.  We were driving my 4x4 truck through the apple orchards. The lane went through a large hedge row with a small stream in it. When we got to the other side we spot-lighted along the woods. About 75 to 100 yards there is an old spot they use to dump garbage.  There was something standing next to the old fridge. I have hunted these woods since I was a little boy and never had seen anything like this. Its belly was about the top of an almost 6 foot tall fridge. I know it was an animal because its eyes reflected in the spotlight. It looked almost like a bear standing on its hind feet but there is no bears in this part of the state. As we sat there trying to figure out what it was it started to turn and walk into the woods.

"I was getting ready for work one morning in the late spring of 2004.  I walked out of my bathroom and there is a window in my bedroom, directly outside of my bathroom door.  I thought I saw something peripherally and turned to look and see what wildlife might be outside my home this day (my backyard is completely wooded).  I gasped and RAN back into the bathroom. What I saw when I looked out the window was no further than four feet from the back of my house and striding by the window when I looked.  Whatever it was stood about 7 feet tall and was covered in brown hair.  It was moving very quickly and was walking on two ""feet"".  I don't know if it saw me, but I saw it. I stood in my bathroom for about a minute trying to gather my thoughts and I peeked out.  At this point, I saw nothing.  I'll be honest, for the past year I've tried convincing myself that there was a bear outside and that I couldn't possibly have seen what I did see.  I do remember specifically saying for the next two weeks (around the house to my significant other and my daughter only) that [a] bigfoot lived in our backyard.","The witness does not want the specific location  published.

"This account happened on the night of the lunar eclipse back in 2003.  I was camping with my friend Pete in NY up behind his cabin (about 1/4 mile up the hill).  It was about 11pm and we were both in our bags in the shelter we built. Pete was already asleep... I was trying to sleep but couldn't so I was poking the fire with a long stick.  I heard something coming down the hill (heard rustling leaves, etc) but figured it was deer coming down the game trail.  It is tough to tell where sounds come from at night and judge distance in the woods because it's so quiet.... but I figured it was pretty far out (about 150 or 200 yds) moving to our left.  I heard some sort of popping sound like the trunk of a tree being hit with something solid or two 2x4s being smacked together and a few growls (kinda like a lion but higher pitched, kinda like a stomach growling)... I still didn't really pay any attention.  I dismissed the popping as trees cracking and the growling to Petes stomach or a low volume snore.  Whatever this thing was, it circled our camp keeping the same distance away.  All I heard was the rustle of leaves or twig snaps.  I kept hearing the popping sound occasionnally but I still wasn't freaked out.  The sound eventually stopped basically where it I started hearing it.  I starting thinking that whatever it was, it was a predator (showing stalking behavior)... I figured it was a bear, fox, or some other predator/scavenger that thought it was a good idea to leave us alone.  But then I started getting a really creepy feeling that I was being watched.  I thought my mind was playing tricks and I was imagining it...  but it got worse and worse.  I couldn't hear anything definitive in the woods but was still getting creeped out. I could only see part of the woods because only part of our shelter is open... but I started looking around (from my bag inside the shelter, not walking around) and what I could see was lit up pretty well because of the full moon (after the lunar eclipse anyway).  I looked into a stand of trees and saw a really big dark spot... it looked like a broken off tree trunk darkened by shadow... in basically the same spot where the noises stopped.  I looked around the woods a little more and came back to the  same spot where I saw the tree looking thing... and IT WAS GONE!!  I woke Pete up so I could tell him what was going on... and so I would know I wasn't crazy if I heard something again.  I was telling him what was going on when we heard the popping/thudding sound again... He loaded his gun (Pete has a permit to carry a handgun in NY). We got out of our bags and restoked the fire and I heard his stomach growl... really loud!!  He said, ""Man you must be hungry.""  I said I thought that was his stomach and we just looked at each other.  We went to investigate where I saw the disappearing shadow thing and we made a lot of noise to scare off whatever it was (breaking branches, kicking at the leaves, talking/yelling to each other).  We looked around the woods a bit... I heard something up on the ridge keeping pace with us but moving away.  It didn't run, just moved away from us at the rate we were moving toward it.  We stayed up for a little while longer and heard nothing so we went back to bed.  Pete was out like a light and I stayed awake just listening. About 30 minutes later, THE THING CAME BACK!! I woke Pete up as I heard it come down off the hill from the same direction it started from... it was making a truck load of noise banging trees (we think it actually pushed one over too). It growled a few times,  and it's foot steps were really heavy... based upon how Pete and I sounded moving through the woods earlier, this thing had to weigh much more than both of us (I'm 6'2"" and 250lbs).  It came in on our left and walked behind our camp about 30-50 yds... We couldn't see it because it was on the non-open side of our shelter and we didn't want to pop out and provoke an attack.  It kept walking in the same direction and eventually was out of earshot but we figured that was enough of a warning. We packed up and went back to the cabin. There are many screwed up things about this.  First, I've been hunting for years and I don't get spooked... Pete is ex-military and no slouch in the woods either.  But this spooked us bad enough to make us want to pack up the gear at two in the morning (leaving some of it on the hill) and come back to the cabin.  Second, two of us heard this thing so I know its not just my mind playing tricks on me... it was definitely there!!  Third, this thing was massive... It made a whole bunch of noise when it walked behind our camp (more than any animal I have ever heard) and it's footsteps almost shook the ground.  But here comes the most screwed up part of the story.  I have hunted for 15+ years and know what animals sound like coming through the woods... I have heard deer, bear, fox, etc... just about any animal in NJ, NY, PA, and ME... and, ofc ourse, other hunters.  I can tell you with 100% certainty...  THIS THING WAS WALKING ON TWO FEET!! I checked the area the next day and found a large foot print in soft earth... about 3 inches longer than mine and about 2 inches wider (I wear a size 12).  I tracked the animal (or whatever) for a few hundred yards but only found one other definate track and it was the same size roughly.  I also found a dead tree that was knocked to the ground probably the night before (fresh earth on the roots, leaves under/around it disturbed)... I presume it was the large crash we heard the night before.",,Steuben County,New York,Fall,Report 19836: Campers describe incidents over 3-4 hours with unseen animal near their camp outside Prattsburgh,42.54346,-77.36516,11/9/2003,19836,Class B,dr8fp8b3t5,33.96,24.41,14.86,17.21,0.81,0,0.52,0.0035,1,snow,1039.21,Heavy snow (1–2 in.) in the morning.,3,10,167,1.8
"Visual Report: My name is Alan Y. on about Mid-November 2012 I had a very unusual experience that at first kept me very mixed up, but always stayed in my mind until I started doing research. It was about 2 to 3am in the morning. I awoke to go outside and have a smoke. The area of the town of Bath, NY is semi-rugged with hundreds of huge foothills. There is a vast amount of forest, lakes, ponds, wildlife and many state parks. Much of the land is posted ""no hunting"". The hills are super steep, so climbing or hiking is difficult. We rented the full basement apartment of a home. Our entryway was in the back of the home semi-underground. There was a deck over our entryway. I am an ex-US Army Intel (Special Tasking veteran) who served in central America and the Middle East. I am telling you this because I am a trained observer and weigh out everything I see. I am super aware of my surroundings. That morning I went outside and lit up a cigarette. It was very dark this night and cool. Deer would constantly wander through and many times I could be 10 feet from a deer and be silent so as not to spook them. As I lit up my smoke some movement caught my attention about roughly [140] yards directly in front of me to the East. A cinnamon brownish colored figure was pacing back and forth over and over. On each side of this clear cut there is a couple homes. This thing was at the far end by the next tree line pacing back and forth moving towards the last home and back again moving appx. North to South then back the other way. It was moving erratically pacing back and forth like it was confused or undecided if it wanted to go closer to the home. As I looked at first, I thought it was a drunk person? But in all the years I lived there, I never seen anyone out there. As I watched what really caught my attention was it looked like it was floating across the ground as there was absolutely no head bob at all. The ground rose between myself and this entity and went back down on its side so I could not see the lower legs good. It kept on pacing back and forth for about 3 minutes. At the position I was at under the deck, in the shadows, I was not observed by this creature. I’m not a afraid of too much, but for some reason the hairs stood up on the back of my neck and I got into what I call (combat mode). I wanted to bellow out at this entity (Ahh) but something said do not do that. Around 3 to 4 minutes of this pacing, I turned my head for a second and it was gone. I got a fearful sense of where this thing went and had a feeling it may try to flank me around the 2 homes, so I went into the house and awakened my wife and said “there’s something weird out there."" I did not think of ""Bigfoot"" right away, because it was not the Patty type I seen on the P&G film. I also thought that they are in the Northwest, not really here in New York State. It was I believe 6-7 feet tall, a slimmer build. Wide on top and slimmer than Patty. More like a fine-tuned athlete than a body builder, long arms and an awfully long shaggy head of hair (which stood out too me, WEIRD. The reason I even saw it was because there was a light on that home as he was pacing towards, that lit up it and some of the area.  Upon seeing it (after the fact), I realized that there was a hedgerow running parallel to it, and a large ravine behind that that ran into the woods. Across from this property was a road, couple mobile homes then a very step wooded foothill (small mountain). For years this baffled me, and I could not get this out of my mind until I visited the BFRO website and seen at least 6 reports entirely around my area.

"This was recorded very soon after it happened in our camp journal. It was the weekend of May 11th 2002.  My wife and I were at our seasonal camp on Lake George for the early season.  We had bed for the night in front of the fireplace.  There were only a few lights belonging to other early season camps across the lake.  It was a calm night.  My wife was sound asleep.  She often sleeps through thunder storms.  I was up throughout the night.  I was awake for the sound of the first scream. The first cycle did not wake my wife unfortunately the second closer scream did.  Someting screamed four times in the distance.  Thirty seconds later it screamed again, on our property.  We have less than a quarter acre of land.  The time was around 2:30am.  Thirty seconds to a minute later it screamed for the last time in the distance at a third location. The scream was in an evenly spaced pattern of four screams.  Each scream was about three to five seconds apart.  The volume was that of human sized lungs.  However, there was no attempt to form words or partial words.  The scream did not change pitch.  It sounded much like a human female.  There was no sound of the creature crashing through the woods.  Please note that a few years back a similar sound was heard by a camp only five down from us.  Other sitings have occured very near to my camp.  The screams made the hair on our necks stand up.  Very frightening.  There have also been sightings of mountain lions in the area.

"This happened in summer sometime between 1980-82 approximate. My then husband and I liked to hike. We lived in Lake George,N.Y. and were aware of the rangers road up the back of Prospect Mtn. We foolishly figured it wuld be an hour up and and hour back and we'd be home by supper and didn't take a flashlight. It took 2 hours up and the sun was beginning to wane. Now my husband had a habit of walking very fast sometimes out of my sight and I kept yelling, almost crying,"" Wait ,wait for me!""As it got near dusk, the road was darker and darker and I finally grabbed and held on to his arm so I wouldn't be left alone and behind. Then we heard something big crunching up the ground just off the road in the woods beside us and following along with us.If we stopped, it stopped.

"My friend and I were hiking on a trail called Five Mile Mtn. We were at the top of the Mtn when I had this eary feeling about the woods ahead. I have never felt like that before in the woods during daylight. We started to smell rain in the air and it was getting chilly quick. We were already 2 hours into our hike at least. Anyways, we stuck with our gut feeling and starting heading back. About ten minutes later, a big rock came flying from the left heading towards the right and hit another rock and made a loud crack. The rock must have rolled for at least 5 seconds afterwards. I could tell by the sound the rock made when it hit, that is was a big rock. And the fact that it rolled for such a long distance afterward. It had to be someone or something very strong. We stuck around the area for another 5-7 minutes to see if we could see or hear anything but no luck. I had already known that this area has had its own encounters with bigfoot so I suspected that this was what it was. I decided to start throwing rocks back into the woods in the direction of the 1st rock as we continued walking back. I continued this down the trail. I was hoping to get a rock in return, and before long, I did. Another rock came in our direction. They were not thrown directly at us but above us and behind us. We were in shock. I just couldn't believe that someone or something was throwing rocks back at me. I continued throwing rocks into the woods as I walked and the rocks were returned. I felt as if it were playful at first, but it then became aggressive. We came to a pond and the trail wrapped around part of the pond. We heard a tree moving but it sounded like it was being shaken. the wind was definitely not making the tree make that sound. Keep in mind that something has been rock throwing for at least 20 minutes now. We stopped in this area and was trying to see where the noise was coming from. I couldn't see a thing. I decide to take a step in the direction of the noise and I felt my stomach drop. I knew there was something there. I couldn't see it but I could feel it. It was one of those feelings you just have to have yourself to understand. I moved back onto the trail and I decided to pick up a few rocks and start throwing them in that direction to see if I could get a return rock. It didn't take long before one came flying back. I decided to be brave again and try to step off the trail and throw a few rocks closer towards where the rocks were being thrown at me. This time I had a rock the size of a baseball. As I was throwing my rock, a rock bigger than mine was also in the air coming towards me. It came extremly close to my head. My friend was on the trail behind me so she had a clear view of the rock coming towards me. The rock hit a tree behind me and bounced onto the trail. There was no denying that these were not rocks now! The proof was there. It seemed that whatever they were, they were getting annoyed with me. The rocks were now being thrown directly at me instead of around me. We decided to knock it off for a little while and get the heck out of there. about 5 minutes down the way, I suspected that we were being followed out of the woods. So to see if something was still there, I picked up some rocks again. I started throwing them one after another without stopping. I must have thown about 5 or 6 when a rock came soaring down from the high cliff at us. I said to my friend ""see I told you they were still here."" I knew that whatever it was, was just as curious about me as I was of it. They continued to fire a few more rocks off the cliff at me; they were definitely trying to hit me! I looked so hard into the woods but I couldn't see a thing. I thought maybe it was just a person, but I don't believe that is was. Especially from the high cliff. A person would have been noticed easliy. The last but not least rock was the icing on the cake. I was not even expecting it. We were walking and talking for a few minutes and I was not throwing any rocks when a rock the size of a softball came down and wizzed past our heads. We both ducked and covered our heads out of instinct. If we did not duck, one of us would have been hit. That was it for me. I knew it was time to get out of those woods and stop messing around. It was an expierence we will never forget. I have no idea what is in those woods up there but that was the wierdest thing that has ever happened to me. We will chalk it up in our memory book.

"while camping in the Lake Luzerne/4th lake area we heard several hoot-whoops on July 24th at approx 0130--200.prior to hearing these whoops, I heard something large walking approx 20-30 ft away from our camp. a distinctive ""cracking"" noise was made as if something very large either broke or stepped on a large branch these vocalizations were between 2, and possibly a 3rd animal. they were heard moving away from our area. I almost wonder if they were herding prey for hunting purposes. approx 02 hrs later I heard them again as they moved back into our area.I have heard these noises before and I immediately recognized the sounds as they are so unique.there were 7 people in our tent. 4 teenage girls (my wife myself and our 10 month old son.we all heard them and needless to say the girls and my wife were a little startled.",,Warren County,New York,Summer,Report 26338: Possible vocalizations heard by campers In Lake Luzerne area,43.32,-73.81,7/26/2009,26338,Class B,drew2qjjq3,77.49,70.25,63.01,67.01,0.89,0.6,0.17,0.0029,0.83,rain,1010.44,Mostly cloudy throughout the day.,9,6.38,205,1.02
"This was years ago. I'm 38 now, but when this happened I was 14. My father worked with a guy who had some prime property in Naples, NewYork. Being that I was 14, I was not old enough to have a hunters license. So my father let me go with him, and I had the task of pushing the deer to him. We got to the property just before daylight, Dad went about 200 yards up the the road, and I went the opposite way, and went into the woods. It started getting light out, and I remember that it was real cold that morning. It had snowed the day before but there was only patches of snow on the ground. I had been walking through some thick sections of brush and was getting tired. I was walking in a shallow gully with a 20ft ridge on both sides of me. I walked up the ridge (I believe) to my left. There was a large tree laying down, so I sat down with my back against it. I could see pretty clear, the whole area. I guess I dozed off for a bit. I woke up, hearing what sounded like a large branch had snapped. I looked to my right, and then to my left, but as I looked to my left (paning the view) I saw something on the the oppisite ridge across from me. There was this large dark figure just standing there turned my way. It had heavy fur like hair all over it. I could'nt make out a face because it had long tangled hair hanging down. Now this figure was maybe 30 ft away give or take. Being cold as it was, I remember it breathing through the hair in front of its face (that really creeped me out). I sat there up against that tree with my heart racing out of my chest, afraid to move. This went on for minutes, feeling like a lifetime.Then all of a sudden it took one step torwards me (I think it was its left leg).That's when I jumped up, turned, and ran as fast as I could. I remember, I had run into a high fence line earlier that morning, that took my some time to scale. Well I jumped through this area of the fence from total terror of what might be chasing me. I managed to get to the road and ran full sprint to the car which was a ways down the road. The car was locked. Thats when I looked around, but nothing was after me (thank god). I waited about 2 hours and finally saw my dad walking down the road. He was pretty upset with me leaving the woods as early as I had but I told him what happened, and what I saw, and he did'nt believe any of it. He figured I was just cold and tired making it up. I had never even heard of bigfoot when I was 14. I didnt know what it was, but I know for a fact that it wasn't a bear.This figure was dark brown but lighter colored around its shoulders and thighs. Its arms were, I thought, too long for its body. I figure it was at least between 7 to 9 foot tall. It had to weigh 4 or 500 lbs. at least. From reading some of your articles, people have said it smelled bad, but I didnt smell any odor that I remember.",,Ontario County,New York,Fall,Report 7368: Morning sighting by deer hunter near Naples,42.6153,-77.4028,10/7/2006,7368,Class A,dr8fqtvh05,62.85,51.8,40.75,36.35,0.71,0.22,0.52,0,0,,1031.13,Mostly cloudy in the morning.,5,8.42,127,0.56
"I witnessed a Sasquatch at about 225 yards distance for approximately 15 seconds, while it traveled around 75 yards along the back of a stone quarry near Middleport, NY in the Fall of 2002/September. I stop there to look for deer in a large field behind the quarry that are always there and immediately noticed when I exited my truck a dark biped moving very rapidly through waist high field grass on very uneven rocky terrain. It seemed to float through the grass as I could not see its legs due to the height of the grass it moved through. Immediately I noticed that it was completely the same color and it seemed to hold its arms at its side as it moved very, very quickly from left to right. At first sight I thought it was a girl with very long hair but quickly noticed that it was completely the same color with no obvious clothes coloration and moved much too fast although at the distance I was I could not make out any actual features and at no time did it look in my direction, but I believe I startled this creature by pulling into the stone driveway which makes considerable noise. As it crossed a path next to a corn field and angled slightly away from me I noticed that its glutteal area was somewhat lighter colored. The biped then moved directly into a standing corn field and was not seen after that time. When I say traveled very quickly, I mean it was really moving very rapidly but at no time did it seem like it was running as you or I would look if traveling at that speed due to fact that there was no discernable movement of its arms as it ""floated"" through the tall grass. I am convinced that this was a sasquatch I witnessed as I have been an avid outdoorsman since a very young age, hunting, hiking and camping for over 40 years and very experienced with animals in the wild and I know what I saw that afternoon was remarkable.",Mountain Rd. runs parallel to Rt. 31A and parallel to the Erie Canal about 1/2 mile North of sighting location.

"My wife and I have had our farm near Treadwell, NY in Delaware County since the summer of 2001. The farm is above 130 mostly wooded acres (I don't want to give the exact number of acres to avoid someone figuring out which one it is), with about 30 acres of fields, with a few trails throughout the woods. The property is bordered by probably 2,000 or more acres of continuous woods (privately owned), and countless more acres of woods and fields that lead all the way up to Canada by just crossing dirt roads, except for one major highway (88). I have had a fascination for Bigfoot since I was young, and read about reported sightings, etc., so I am keen to notice things that could be attributed to these possible creatures others might not notice. I say possible creatures because even though I have a strong feeling they exist, I have not seen one with my own eyes. The first thing that happened was not long after we got our place. We were sitting around a campfire we made not far from the house, when we began to hear the sound of wood being pounded against wood coming from what seemed to be our woods up on the hill. The distance up to those particular woods is probably 300 yards or more, but this sound was clear and strong. I told my wife what I thought it could be and she told me she didn’t want to hear anymore about it because it frightened her. There was no other explanation that could explain that distinct sound to me though. I tried to duplicate the sound in the woods myself, but could get nowhere near the resonance that must have been produced to carry the distance I think we heard it from. On another occasion I took our dog out for his nightly walk, and heard a tremendous short howl/scream/yelp with a whole lot of modulation. It gave me a chill down my spine. It was just a huge sound. We have coyotes all around here and I have heard them make some strange sounds, but I have never heard that sound from a coyote. Whatever made that sound I would imagine had to be a pretty big animal. It did not seem far away either, so after shinning the flashlight along the edge of the woods, I hightailed back to the house checking over my shoulder often. Perhaps along this same line, my wife was out with the dog one early evening in the field, and this is the mildest dog you will ever encounter, it has only ever growled while asleep and chasing something in its dreams. My wife told me that she had never seen our dog behave this way, and it doesn’t even pay attention to deer when it sees them anymore because it sees them so often. The dog was looking intently at something along the wood line and growling. My wife could see nothing, but the dog saw something that scared it. It may have been a bear, as I have seen tracks and sign occasionally? The last incident, and probably the most convincing to me are the tracks that we saw in our woods this past winter (2004). We have never been able to get into our woods in the winter because the snow has always been too deep, and the hill to those particular woods to steep. The snowshoes that we tried in the past just sunk in the powdery snow. We tried a new type on a snow with an ice crust and we were able to get into the woods for quite a ways. We came across a trail of two pairs of tracks going in a couple of different directions and meeting up again a hundred yards or so later that no humans could have made. I at first I thought the tracks could have been made by deer leaping, but the tracks appeared to be a two legged stride with one foot pointing a little right and one a little left alternating perfectly. I am 6 feet tall, and I took my snowshoes off to see what king of stride I could make, and I was about a foot or two short of reaching the stride of these prints. The prints were pretty old as they had been snowed on, so I couldn’t see much, and tried to feel for features like toes, but could not say for sure that I felt any. They were quite long, but the snow could have melted to make them bigger? What struck us was the length of the stride though. So, that is our experience to this point for what its worth. I only wanted to let you know that there could be something to these incidences. I would not dare ask my neighbors if they have had any strange thing happen, even though they are very good friends of ours. I find it ironic that they may have had more significant encounters and may be afraid to say anything to us about it. One neighbor did say they heard what sounded like a dear being attacked and screaming in the woods in the night. They have never heard anything like it, so that was their only explanation. One of them works for an environmental agency that I won’t identify and spends a lot of time in the woods.",Location directions withheld by request.,Delaware County,New York,Winter,Report 8953: Multiple observations over three year span,42.36176,-75.0116,3/1/2003,8953,Class A,drd8vpdpph,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"My unusual experience occurred during the first week of October 2005. I was scouting for deer in a very isolated and limited access area in upstate New York accessible by a 4 x 4 trail. I had scouted another area earlier during the day and had about 2 hours of good daylight left to scout this area. My standard practice is to drive the entire length of the valley to check the parking areas as to see where other hunters are located before scouting. On this day, like most during pre archery and archery season, I was the only person and vehicle on the 4000 acres. I turned around and headed back up the valley to where I wanted to scout. It was a nice sunny fall day but the sun was beginning to drop. I parked my truck, grabbed my backpack, and headed down a steep ravine into a creek bed. I crossed the creek and proceeded up the other side of the wooded ravine. There is a field at the top of the ravine that I crossed and a hedgerow that separated a hidden field on top.  I wanted to check some apple trees for apples. On the far side of the hidden field is a large pile for rocks that appear to be the foundation of an old homestead. I usually climb on top of the rock pile because it is high enough for me to glass the entire field to the top, which is a couple hundred yards. I glassed the field and saw nothing, which is odd for that time of day but not unheard of. A deer trail crosses in front of the rock pile and heads into a marsh area with a thicket on the backside of the marsh. The thicket is a few hundred yards wide then breaks into a mature open hardwood where I wanted to scout for a tree stand location. I was about halfway across the marsh when I heard a very loud, deep, resonating growl or roar. It stopped me dead in my tracks and came from the thicket I was headed into about 100 yards away. I have never heard anything in the woods in my 25 years of hunting like it. It was not a cat, coyote, dog, and I do not think a bear. I did see a very large bear the season before in this area at 20 yards but he did not make a sound when I waved him off. He just stood up and looked at me then turned and ran off about 50 yards before walking again. I had a rifle at the time and the bear did not see me until I waved at him. He was walking straight down the mountain at me where I was sitting on stand next to a huge boulder. One year I did spook a bear out of a small orchard and he kind of ""woofed"" at me as left the area. But this sound wasn't anything like a ""woof"" it was more of a roar that lasted about 1 to 1.5 seconds. I was shocked and taken back by it. After stopping dead in my tracks I spotted a big flat rock a few feet away. I climbed up on the rock and took my pack off. What ever made the noise was very large so I dug out my hunting knife and put it on my belt. I usually carry a sidearm when scouting but they are not allowed in this area. That day I wish I had one with me. I glassed the thicket with my binoculars but I could not see anything that could have made the sound. After about 5 minutes of looking, I wrote it off as a bear and decided to change direction and go check another field that is over the hill from the field I crossed to get to the marsh but at other end of that field. I started walking up the marsh parallel to the thicket and to my surprise and shock; whatever was in the thicket was walking parallel to me or flanking my right side. I could hear it snapping limbs and twigs as it walked. This was something heavy at least the size of a deer, bear, or person. I never heard anything scamper or scurry in the leaves like a small animal will eventually do if you listen long enough. I could hear it busting through the saplings. At this point I decided to get out of the marsh and into 75 to 100 yard wide hedgerow and that runs between the field I crossed and the marsh. This also would lead me away from the thicket. I could not hear whatever was in the thicket after I got into the hedgerow. I was about in the middle of the hedgerow on an old logging road that runs parallel to the field I crossed to get to the marsh when I ran across something odd. There were two trees about 20 to 25 feet in height bent completely over and parallel to the ground across the logging road. The trees were a good 4 to 5 inches in diameter. There was no obvious damage to the trees and the trees were alive with green leaves on them. I kept walking up the hedgerow and toward the field at the top. I arrived at the top of the hill and top of the field I had crossed to get into the marsh. There is a hedgerow that separates the two fields. I glassed the second field for a few minutes and saw nothing. I had yet to see any kind of wildlife on this scouting trip. The sun was starting to get very low in the sky so I decided to start heading back to my truck. I knew if I followed the top hedgerow down the hill I would pass a couple apple trees and it would lead me to the top of the ravine. I kept following the hedgerow down the hill until I almost reached the top of the ravine. I stopped to check for deer sign around a couple of apple trees. As I was looking for sign, I heard a series of ""knocking"" noises coming from about the area where I crossed the ravine on my trip up into the fields. I would estimate the knocking was 200 to 250 yards away. It was not a woodpecker because the time between knocks was too long and it was a more dulled whack rather than a hollow sound a woodpecker makes. A woodpecker has an almost machine gun sound to it. I heard a series of about 4 or 5 knocks then 20 seconds later another series and then another series. At this point, I got kind of spooked because it seemed whatever was in the thicket had backtracked me to where I had crossed the creek and ravine at the start of my scouting trip. The sun was starting to set behind the mountain and it was going to start to get dark quickly. I was literally miles from any main road or person and in the middle of nowhere. If whatever was backtracking me continued to do so, then we were going to end up at the same place, my truck. My original plan was to walk the top of the ravine back down to where I had crossed the first time because it is easier to climb back up the hill.  Well, that is where I was hearing the knocking noise coming from so I decided I didn't want to get any closer to the source of the knocking. I headed straight down the side of the ravine into the creek bottom. It much darker in the creek bottom and everything was in shades of gray. I stopped for a moment to catch my breath before I started up the other side of the ravine to my truck. As I was standing there catching my breath, I started hearing rocks landing on the rocks in the creek bed a couple of hundred yards downstream from me. I could not tell if they were rolling down the hill and landing on the rocks in the creek bed or being thrown. I could hear the rocks land on other rocks and roll around a bit. This happened 5 or 6 times. After hearing this, I just headed straight up the other side of the ravine grabbing trees to pull myself up and got out of there as quickly as possible. I hit the jeep trail about 75 yards above where I parked. I made a beeline for my truck, dumped my pack in the passenger side and drove out of there as quickly as I could and the trail would let me. It was four wheel drive low range all the way out. I kept checking in my side and rearview mirrors for anything on the road behind me. I never saw anything on the road behind me. Was it a bigfoot? I can't say that. I can say that I have never heard a roar or growl like that in the woods. I researched the Internet on animal vocalizations but could not find anything that was an exact match. The closest match was a snarling wolf but it was not the sound I heard. I listened to the bigfoot vocalizations on this site and can not say that is what I heard either. The thing roared or growled once and it was kind of short. It startled me and I didn't get a second chance to hear it. After reading some of the reports on this site, the unusual events that occurred that day match other people's experiences. There are also reports on this site that are from the same area as I was scouting. I was back in the area again during gun season 6 weeks later and did not see or experience anything unusual. I usually don't spook very easy and travel the backcountry alone quite often. I will admit, that day I was spooked by something.",Witness requested location details be kept confidential,Delaware County,New York,Fall,Report 14373: Possible daylight stalking and knocking heard by hunter near Deposit,42.0837,-75.38025,10/1/2005,14373,Class B,dr6rktjg2f,71.6,57.33,43.06,44.3,0.81,,0.94,0,0,,,Clear throughout the day.,0,,219,1.11
"My sister and her two children, my wife and I and our two dogs went to Nuclear lake in Dutchess county for an overnight camping trip. We set up camp in a field next to the lake a few hundred feet off the applician trail. We had two tents and went in them to sleep around 11:00p.m. My sister was feeling uneasy so I sent my male dog to her tent to sleep with her and the kids. My older dog, my wife, and myself were in my tent. I turned the opening of my tent to face my sisters tent door so she felt less stressed. An hour went by and the kids my old dog and wife were sleeping. Suddenly I heard foot steps coming from the woods heading toward us. It was a very dark night but I saw no flashlight shine. Then my young dog in my sisters tent started to make this whine/growl and I could clearly hear a person walk behind my sisters tent, but still no flashlight shine! All the while my sister was awake and my young dog freaking out almost crying and he is a pitbull not afraid of any critter. I KNEW it was a bigfoot and told my sister not to worry because she hates the woods and couldnt sleep. The next morning she looked very tired and we only spoke about it a month later on the phone. She said she knew it was a biped and couldnt sleep all night. My wife, my two dogs and I are trail runners and twice a week do 6 mile runs on this section of the Appalacian trail. It is remote and rugged and I have Moose dropping on my fireplace mantle from that area and bear sightings are common. A few miles up the trail is a large beautiful swamp also. This is not my first time I had the feeling bigfoot was around. My wife and I are in the woods more then anyone I know. We hike and back pack all summer and log 25 miles a week in the woods trail running. I made a report a few years ago when we were hiking up Buck mountain when a bigfoot was smashing trees and making that loud click noise like I can do with my tounge but 10 times louder. I know a woman who had a daytime visual in st. lawrence county n.y. and I also know a man who had a visual in penn. when he was hunting deer. What is the real story on bigfoot. Are they so slick that no one can get a good picture or do they just scare people so much that the powers that be dont want the cat out of the bag.

"I was driving on a backroad in Rhinebeck, NY. I was heading to a rehearsal at the Rhinebeck Center of Performing Arts at about 6 :30 in the evening. The road is called Pilgrims Progress Road. While I was driving on this road, I passed a 20 mph road sign because it's a sharp right turn, but on the same road. The road is very curvy. I passed this turn, and in the middle of the road was a Hannaford bag with an open cereal box, and a log placed in the bag. I had to go in the left lane to miss the bag. As I passed the bag, something darted behind my car from the left. I looked in my rear view mirror, and saw this big, black thing right where the bag was. At first, I thought it was a bear because it looked like it was on all fours. I kept driving, looking in my rear view mirror. After a few seconds, it was out of my vision. I kept driving down the road until I pulled into a driveway on the right, and turned around to see what it was. As I got to the location where the bag was, I noticed the bag was missing. I kept driving for about 0.2 miles down the road, past the 20 mph sign. As I turned, I saw something walking on two feet about 50 yards in front of my car. It was walking on the side of the road. I could see that it was definitely not a bear. It was black, and it looked as if the hair was short. It's back was towards me, and the shoulders were very broad. It looked like it was slouching, and I couldn't really see it's arms. I don't know if it was holding something, or if it was the way it walked. I'm about 6'5"", and It looked like it was taller than me from what I saw. I saw it for a good three to four seconds, until it leaped up this little hill to the right. I sped up to the location I saw it leap from, and got out of my vehicle. I looked all around because there weren't many trees. The grass was very high though. I didn't see it after that.

"I didn't have an encounter exactly but we are owners of a camp in a remote region of the Adirondack Mountains.  This camp is only accessible by hiking to it.  There is rarely anyone ever around our camp.  We have found strange things that have occurred. 1) Fall 2002: We went hiking for the day  and when we got back we found a small pile of rocks at the back door that were neatly stacked with a stick coming out of them.  These rock were not there when we left.  They appeared to be deliberately stacked.  We understand that these could have been made easily by a human, but there is never anyone around up there. 2)  Fall 2003: One night around 7:30 pm (dark) my wife and I  went outside with 2 dogs.  We smelled something very strong and musty, like nothing we smelled before.  It wasn't the dogs or anything we could identify.  The 2 dogs got very antsy and wanted to go inside right away.  This was very strange and freaky, these dogs are generally not scared dogs.  They also are large dogs about 80 lbs. each. We had never seen them act this way.  When we bring them out at night or day they run all over the woods this night they wanted nothing to do with that.  Almost like they smelled something that scared them. 3)  The same exact night as number 2.  I went outside around 9:30 pm to relieve myself.  While I was doing that I heard large heavy stomping behind me. The stomping was loud and heavy as if something was fleeing.  The strange part is it sounded like it made 4-5 bounds then stopped.  I heard nothing else after that.  I looked around a little but the happenings of this night made be uneasy so I went inside and locked up the cabin. I don't know what did all of this and maybe it is easily explained away but these things altogether make me think it might have been a bigfoot.",,Essex County,New York,Fall,"Report 11956: Unusual events at remote family cabin near Keene Valley, NY",44.1856,-73.8094,12/28/2005,11956,Class B,drge27txu2,30.95,30.695,30.44,21.53,0.89,1,0.91,0,0,,1007.56,Foggy in the morning.,1,8.51,104,0.52
"On June 10, 2006 I was driving with my brother on a back road (unpaved) in the Adirondack Park. We were heading for a trail head that led into the Hudson River Gorge. This area is almost dead center in the park and surounded by many mile of unihabited and very rugged terrain. It was late morning on a clear day. I was driving as fast as i could on this road because we had to get back to town by a certain time. As we turned a bend I saw a very large, brown, furry, object lunge into the dense woods up the road at the next curve about 50 yards ahead. It was obvious that the creature was in the road and was startled by my speeding SUV. I told by brother, ""Hey, there goes a moose."" We reached that spot in about 3 seconds, and i slamed on the breaks - expecting to see the moose right there in the bushes. At that spot, through the bushes, was a decent sized clearing and then more dark woods that went down a hill. There was nothing there at all. Everything was still. We started off again and took our hike. The more I thought about it, the more I thougth I just could not have been a moose. First of all it was the wrong color - a light chestnut bown. (The color was very visible because the sun was shinning in the area. It was a striking shade against the ligth green of the brush.) Moose are never that shade - they are always a very dark brown. Second, the size and shape were wrong. This thing was huge - at least 7 feet tall. And the shape was not like a Moose rump. The more I thght about it, the more it seemed like it was the upper back and head of something. Finaly, if it was a moose, it would not have utterly vanished so quickly. My vehicke got to that spot in just seconds. Moose, at least the ones that I have seen, don't tear off into the wood. We should have seen it in the clearing. It wan't a bear, either. Not even close. I wished I had stopped to investigate further. Unfortunately, we were in a hurry","The road that pases through Minerva NY. Go north for about 10 miles. Take a left at the ""North Woods Club"" Rd.

"Bigfoot Sighting Date: Early August 2010 Time: Approx. 8-8:30 am Place: Cascade Lakes, NY (near Keene) Weather: Clear with a few clouds I spend most of the summers camping in and around the Adirondacks in my Dodge Caravan. This particular summer I had stopped at Cascade Lake to spend a few days camping. I had slept soundly the previous night and had woken up around 7:00 am. I decided to get up and start making my breakfast. I had just started the kettle on the camp stove when I looked over at upper Cascade lake and could see the mist rising off the surface of the lake. I grabbed my iphone and walked about 50 yards to the edge of the lake to get a picture. As I approached the breakwall, I noticed a dark brown object on the opposite side of the lake at the shore. At first I couldn’t make out what it was but it seemed to be sitting at the waters edge. I then realized that it must be a bear. The animal looked like it was doing something in the water with its paws as I could hear a faint splashing sound. I thought it would be a good idea to get a picture so I brought my iphone up to face level and tried to focus in on the animal. As I was focusing in, the animal stood up on two legs. I was startled and pulled down my phone to see this with my own eyes. It took a step towards the treeline and stopped. Almost methodically, as it stopped, it turned it’s whole upper body to the left and stared at me for a couple of seconds. It turned back and in one step, disappeared into the tree line. I immediately went cold and got scared. As I ran back to my campsite, my only thought was that it was going to go left or right. If it went right it would have to go into the water and if it went left, it was headed directly for my campsite. I decided that it was best to get the hell out of dodge so to speak. I arrived back at my campsite in under a minute. My dog was still asleep on the front seat and didn’t stir at all. I opened the passenger side sliding door of my van and started to throw all of the camping gear back into the van, making quite a mess inside as I did. I closed the door and then jumped into the drivers seat and floored the gas to leave. As I was driving out, I kept looking out my left drivers side window to see if I could observe it again, but I saw nothing. I drove all the way into Lake Placid and parked at a mall parking lot to gather my thoughts and think about what had taken place. I was pretty shaken up as I kept replaying the experience over and over in my head trying to make sense of what I had seen. Observations: I could not ascertain its height exactly, because of the distance, but I would guess that it was approximately 7-8 foot tall. It was covered head to toe in shaggy dark brown hair or fur. I could see the sunlight shining off its back as it turned to go into the treeline and could see the brown coloration as it turned away from me. When it turned to stare at me, I could not make out any facial features but I knew that it saw me. The upper body was massive and stocky like a football players build. It had very long arms that went well below its waist. I could also make out what I assume were the shape of hands. It walked upright and paused before slowly turning its upper body to look directly at me. It stared at me for approximately 5-10 seconds and turned back to face the treeline. It took 1-2 steps and disappeared into the forest. I could see a couple of branches move after it went into the trees. It was then I decided to leave. I did not hear anything other then the initial splashing it made in the water with its hands when I first thought it was a bear. I did not return to the area until three years later with a friend to camp. Nothing has happened on subsequent trips to the area of Cascade Lake. I have had two other odd experiences in other areas of the ADK’s on other trips.",Cascade Lake,Essex County,New York,Summer,Report 64192: Camper describes morning sighting at Cascade Lake near Lake Placid,44.22388,-73.87529,8/6/2010,64192,Class A,drg7wftwub,65.27,50.27,35.27,50.88,0.73,0.38,0.88,0,0,,1005.7,Foggy overnight.,7,9.997,272,6.71
It was about 130 in the morning and me and a buddy were driving up to Caroga lake on rt 29 when my headlights caught something crossing the road in the distance. When we got close enough to see whatever it was crossed the guard rail like it wasn’t even there and proceeded to walk into the woods. I couldn’t tell what color it was but it was big we went back the next day and my buddy who is 6’2 tried to cross the guard rails and he had trouble doing it so I would have to say it was at least 7 feet tall.

"My friend and I finished preparing for a big outdoors event and we were sitting outside his home.  It was around 11 p.m and his wife and dog had gone inside for the evening.  Across the road from his house there is a large swamp that goes up to a small mountain.  Our talk was cut short by an odd scream about 75 yards into the swamp on the right at ground level.  I asked my friend, an avid hunter, what animal screams like that?  He didn't know but we talked that maybe it could be an owl or a fisher.  A few minutes later, in the woods on our side of the road, a large animal broke a lot of dead branches all at once.  It wasn't running but seemed to have just turned around in one location.  A minute or two later three owls hooted between themselves at treetop level in the woods behind his house.  The owls seemed to have been about 50 feet apart.  We commented about this sudden weird activity when something came from the woods and landed in his yard behind us.  We were still facing the road and didn't see the object but I assume it was something around the size of a baseball.  He doesn't have a manicured lawn and it would be impossible to know exactly what it was.  I've thought about this incident for a couple of months and could write off the first three occurrences that evening but the object landing in the yard made this event too much to ignore.

"I was 15 years old at the time, I remember because I didn't have my drivers license yet. My brother and father and I were hunting squirrel. The funny thing was, this was our first hunting experience except for our father. Dad was born and raised in this part of the country. We had moved to Springboro, which is south of Dayton, when he decided to take us on a ""hunting trip.""... Me and my brother were not the ""outdoors type,"" both of us being born in Dayton. My father had borrowed the guns we were using, since we would probably never go again. Me and my brother both knew how to shoot a gun, just never hunted wildlife before. Anyway, we were on our first ""safari,"" very excited and scared at the same time. The year before, my brother and I had got walkie talkies for Christmas. Not the cheap kind, but a nice set with a range of a ""mile"" under normal circumstances.. which was..... ha ha apparently not hills and ""hollers."" Sorry, back to the sighting... We had split up a few hills back, each combing a hill or two. I heard a few shots from two different directions before it got very quiet. Birds had been chirping as the sun was high and the temperature had to be well within the 80's. I was at the top of a ""holler"" and decided to go down, instead of staying on top of the hill. As I descended, I got a weird feeling, as though I shouldn't be there or something else. I started to call my brother on the walkie talkie when I heard a loud sound coming from the right of me and fifty some yards down. I thought, why is someone running? As I approached it from behind, I turned off the walkie talkie so I didn't disturb what I was about to see. At first I thought it was a bear, but it was sitting on a large rock. Then I thought it was my father playing a trick on me, trying to scare me, but he didn't have a costume when we started to hunt. Did he bring one earlier? As this is going through my mind it stood up, I was coming quietly down the ""holler."" I now could hear noise to my left and then right, like people just walking, not trying to draw attention to themselves. What gets me is that it never turned around, like it knew I was there. I was above wind, so how? As it stood, I was maybe 30 yards behind it, I never saw what was to my left and right, but it took off like a shot of lightning. I am now 6 foot 2 and 300 pounds, this thing was at least 8 foot tall and between 350 pounds and 450 pounds. I stood there for what felt like forever, a horrid odor had filled my senses, making me want to cry. I decided to go back up the ""holler"" away from what I had seen. I stood on top of that hill, calling my brother on the walkie talkie telling him to hurry. My father got there first, which I never understood, and he looked old and tired. I asked why are you standing so alert? He said ""we should leave now."" As we were leaving in the truck, I asked why leave so early? He said ""son some things can't be explained.""

"My husband and I and three children decided to go camping for the 4th of July weekend at the Shawnee National Forrest Park in Ohio. We left on friday July 2,2010 and came home on July 6th. On July 6th at 4:00 a.m. in the morning my husband was awakened by a very strange noise and thought maybe raccoons were in our trash but then listened and thought that it couldnt be raccoons by the noise it was making. It sounded like it was calling the other one from the woods into the site. We heard the other one walking behind our tent and my husband started to yell ""HEY HEY GET OUT OF HERE"" and then they ran into the woods and it sounded like stomping.....we then knew it was something very very large. I got the kids and we ran to the car. We drove into Portsmouth for about an hour and half...we couldnt think of any animal that could make that noise or stomp like that through the woods. Maybe a bear but bears couldnt make that noise. So we went back to the campsite this was about 5:30 a.m. and my husband went up first to check it out....it was a liltle light out but not light enough to see into the woods... after he was up there for a little bit i went up and we herd something breathing heavy and then a stick was thrown at me and it made that noise again and we both ran to the car and just slept in our car. Finally when it was like 8:30a.m. we went up to the site and looked around and couldnt find anything missing and our garbage was ripped open but not spread out all over the place.....and my husband went up into the woods and found a pack of our raymon noodles that was opened but not eaten( i thought that was weird most animals eat anything).. So we packed everything up and left. Later that day when i was home i was thinking about the night before all this happened that when i was sitting by our fire i could hear something throwing stuff at our campsite and felt like something was watching us but i thought i was just scaring myself...but it all makes sense now they were watching us and finally came into our camping area the last day we were there! We were camping at 2 different sites that week the first site was xxx and the site that everything happened at was right next to that one just farther back in the woods and that one was xxx.....

"It was toward the end of summer in September 2011 that I had my sighting of a tall hairy bipedal creature. I went to bed around 9:30pm on September 5th and it was a warm summer night approximately 70 degrees outside. I usually don’t get much sleep as I get older and it seems to get worse the older I get. I had awakened at about 2 a.m. in the early morning of the 6th, I had decided to go outside and smoke a cigarette because I don’t smoke in my house. I proceeded to the living room where the french doors are located to go out to the rear deck on my house that is positioned on the S.E. Corner of my house. I walked out on the rear deck and I stood there just in front of the french doors where the ashtray was sitting on the hand rail and I noticed that the moon was mostly full and set in place and that the temperature was rather warm. I was facing my back yard and enjoying the moon light and I might have been there for approximately two to three minutes when I heard a low guttural growl coming from my left from the cornfield. I live on a dead end street and the property that is located beside me is a corn field that belongs to a gentleman that lives up the street. There is a single line of large pine trees that divide my property from the corn field and as I looked over to my left after hearing the growl I couldn’t see anything even though the moon was shining in my direction. I still continued to stand there and about one minute later I heard this low guttural growl once again. I proceeded to extinguish my cigarette and walk back into the house not telling anyone about what happened. The next night I went to bed approximately ten p.m. and again I couldn't sleep and had awakened about one a.m. and  I got up and headed out to the rear deck totally dismissing what I had encountered the previous night. I was standing in the same area again enjoying the warm night and the moon was only showing at about sixty percent but it was still bright and very little clouds that night. The same thing occurred again, it must have been a few minutes as I stood there and I heard the low guttural growl coming from the same area from my left. This time it seemed to be a bit louder and I looked over between the pine trees but I couldn't see anything but darkness. I originally thought it might have been a bear but after checking bear sightings I dismissed it because none  has been reported for my area. At this time I am getting a little nervous because whatever this was it sounded extremely large and seemed to have a large set of lungs. I proceeded back into the house and just as I entered through the door way my wife had gotten up and she was headed to the door to go out to the rear deck. I stopped her and told her about the growls that I have been experiencing that night and the previous night. She replies with “I know,I have heard them before” and with a look on my face I thanked her for not telling me. I hadn't went outside at night for the rest of the week because I had no idea what was lurking in the shadows and I didn't know if it was still hanging around. The next day I had contacted my oldest son and told him what was going on around the house and he said he could come over on Friday the ninth after work and we could check things out. Now it's Friday the ninth and I got home from work at about 5:30 that day and my oldest son was already at my house waiting on me. We proceeded to walk through the the tree line that connects to the south eastern corner of my back yard and it runs along the edge of the corn field and as we were walking through we started to notice strange stick structures that didn't make sense and it seemed to rule out something done by nature. We finally got to the end of the tree line and it meets a large field with tall grass that gets five to six feet high and part of it seems to be swampy and has some cat tails growing on the one side. The temperature that day was warm and sunny with very little cloud cover and no rain but the ground of the field still seemed to be wet and muddy and definitely a paradise for ticks. My son and I made it partially through the field and we stopped to look across the field toward the wooded area and we were facing the south eastern direction over at some crab apple trees that was located on the tree line on the other side of the field. We were standing side by side and out of my peripheral vision I noticed some movement out of the corner of my left eye at the edge of the tree line that was approximately two hundred feet from where we were standing. I asked my son if he had seen the movement as I pointed in the direction of the wooded area and he relied “No I didn't see it” I then said lets go investigate that and see what it could have been. It was about five fifty p.m. by that time and I didn't know if it was deer or anything else because I just saw the movement but couldn't tell shape or color of the subject in question. We finally made it through the field to the tree line and there was a small creek about three foot wide with very little water flowing through it and we also noticed a trail where the deer had been crossing that creek in that same area and it was heavily traveled because the tree roots were showing. We both jumped across the narrow creek and started to walk the deer trail which followed the edge of the narrow creek and I told my son that I was going to check the creeks edge for any type of prints because I know I had seen something move over in that area. My son elected to wait up on the trail while I was searching the creeks edge. I was looking on both sides of the creeks edge when my son alerted me and wanted me to come look at something that was odd to him so I proceeded up the small embankment and walked over to where he was standing. He said “stand where I am and follow the creek down to a large tree on the creeks edge and tell me what that is”. I looked down to the tree which was about a good three hundred feet and I noticed something dark that seemed to be squatting behind that tree but I couldn't tell what it was but I know it wasn't moving so I dismissed it as a log or tree stump. I went back to the creeks edge to continue looking for any type of prints in the soft mud but came up empty handed. I told him we should go into the woods a little deeper just to see what else we can find and I walked back up to the deer trail and just for curiosity I went to the spot where I previously stood to look down to the large tree where we both seen that dark object and this time the area looked different. We walked the deer trail which followed the narrow creek and had noticed the narrow creek tees into a larger creek that was about 15 foot wide but we didn’t see a good spot to cross until we followed it a little farther and we had found a shallow spot that we could cross. Once we crossed the larger creek we split up and I headed south and he headed north and I had been looking around for about five minutes and I heard him call my name and wanted me to go to his location. I walked over to where he was and he was standing in a small clearing that had the greenest grass I had ever seen and this clearing was surrounded by thick brush in the shape of a U. He had noticed an unbearable smell in that area and he asked me if I could smell it and I replied “Yes” but then I asked him what it was because we couldn't pinpoint what type of smell it was because it had a combined odor of rotten eggs and rotted flesh. We both started searching that immediate area for a possible dead animal or anything that could have made that nasty odor. We didn't come up with anything and it was starting to get about 6:30 that night so I told him that we should go but we can come back another time and he agreed. We went back to the large creek and crossed over and walked along the deer trail until we got about twenty feet from the area that we had originally crossed the small creek that took us to the field with the tall grass and he was walking in front of me he stopped and he was looking to his left and I asked what he was doing. He said “look” and as I looked over to my left I couldn't see what he was looking at so I asked him again what he was looking at and he pointed to his left and told me to look with a more stern voice but yet again I couldn't see because I had a tree and limb covered with leaves obstructing my view. I hunched down about six to eight inches to look below the limb and about 100 ft. from us we saw a huge hairy creature standing in a bipedal fashion with a forward gate staring in our direction. There wasn't much between us and this creature but some brush and small saplings and as we stood there in amazement because of the size of this human looking creature I asked my son what it was doing and he replied “It's moving its upper body back and forth” at this time I really don't think that it had set in to our minds what we were exactly looking at but I can say that it seemed as though time stopped and I have no idea how long we actually viewed this thing. We both just stood there and watched this thing and we never moved an inch because I think we were in shock from the massive size. This unexplained creature appeared to be at least seven and a half foot tall and had to weigh a minimum of six hundred pounds. The hair was a dark reddish brown and it had a matted and dirty look to it and most of the face was covered with hair but from what you could see it appeared to be of human trait. The ears were covered with hair and it was standing at an angle to us but I could see the legs were extremely muscular and large and the arms length seemed to go just slightly past the knees. I just couldn't help but to stare at this creature because I couldn't believe the size and just how big it was. I believe that as it was swaying its upper body back and forth because I knew that it knew that we were there but I don't think it knew what our exact location was and it was trying to find us as we were kind of hidden behind some brush. It seemed as my son and myself broke out of some type of hypnosis I looked at my son and said “we need to go”. He agreed and he said he was running but I told him not to run and that we would walk out but we can keep an eye and see if we were going to be followed. We finally made it to the small creek and jumped across and headed across the field with the tall grass as we kept looking behind us to see if we were being followed but didn't notice anything. We made it across the field and took a short cut through the corn field and as we both stepped into my back yard we turned around and looked in the direction of where we just came from and just slightly north of us in the wooded area we both heard two really loud tree knocks and my son looked at me and asked if I heard that and I said “Yes I did”. To this day I will never forget what I had seen that day and I will remember it like it was yesterday and nobody can convince me that it was anything else other than what we call bigfoot. From that day I vowed to become a researcher in the bigfoot world and my goal is to get enough proof of this creature so it can be recognized to mainstream science and documented so we can protect this creature and its habitat.",About 1/4 mile north of Route 30,Stark County,Ohio,Summer,Report 42745: Strange occurrences outside a home lead to a daylight sighting by a father and son near East Canton,40.79438,-81.31219,9/9/2011,42745,Class A,dpq0jdqk2x,75.94,69.345,62.75,63.88,0.88,0.84,0.42,0,0,,1013.21,Foggy until afternoon.,4,1.59,308,0.68
"Well, this is kinda weird because I have been wanting to see a sasquatch for many years now and I believe I had a brief look at one about a week and a half ago. I was driving east on Sagamore Rd. in Sagamore hills Ohio at about 10:33 am to be exact. It was a very Hot muggy day with tempetures in the 90's. As I was driving east on this rd. their is a jogging trail that crosses the road and is actually part of the Cuyahoga Valley National Park system. The trail area was about 100 to 150 yds ahead of me when from the right side of the road I seen a dark figure come out onto the road with such speed that their was no way it could have stopped to look for cars before crossing, this thing was dark brown or black from head to toe. It crossed the road and the open area before the road when I first seen it in 3 strides and it was gone. This thing had the speed of an animal and it held its forearms up high kind of reminds me of the memorial day footage. I also seen a flash of silver or gray color by the forearm and head/face area like it looked my way in the last stride it took. When I first seen it I thought heck it had to be a jogger. The more and more I thought about it I felt that it couldnt have been a jogger for a few reasons, 1 it was 90F + and I couldnt imagine someone dreesed in such dark colors from head to toe, 2nd is the speed this thing had was not humanly possible, if I had blinked my eye I would have missed it, if I would have had a camera I would have missed it anyway because of the speed. 3rd is I am 5'10'' and it took me 5-6 strides just to cross the road in that area which does not include the area that is viewable to the right of the road where the creature first stepped out into.4th is since I have seen this I have driven that road many times to and from work, I have been at about the same distance in my van and have seen joggers cross the road and their arms look like toothpicks compared to what I had seen on that day, as far as guessing a height of the creature I would say it was well over 6ft. but cannot be any more sure than that because their is nothing their to have compared it to but it looked stocky for sure from that distance.",This Rd. is off of St. Rt. 8 obtainable through Northfield Ohio,Summit County,Ohio,Summer,Report 12157: Motorist sees hairy biped crossing road by Cuyahoga Valley National Park,41.35208,-81.57021,7/12/2005,12157,Class B,dpmgpzfmk6,91.22,80.315,69.41,62.35,0.55,0.64,0.19,0,0,,1015.97,Mostly cloudy throughout the day.,7,7.83,131,1.57

"Something heard. It was around 9:30 p.m. and a very dark night. I was unloading music gear from my truck in my garage. It was also particularly quiet. I first heard something that sounded like it may have been a man screaming. I stopped to listen, and heard it again much more clearly. It resembled the famous Columbiana recording, very very eerie. I recognized it because I was familiar with the recording from History Channel programs. I would describe what I heard as more like a roar than a howl, but still a combination of both. I estimate it to have been half a mile to a mile away. I was also able to hear it very clearly because of the quietness of the night.

"I saw Bigfoot from the chest up just below my house, it was in a wooded ravine below my house.  This was on June 4th, 2011.  It arrived there with a great deal of crashing and breaking down of trees.  I was looking to see what was coming when it stood up and looked at me.  It had greyish brown long hair, particularly over the face, wide set eyes, ears on the sides of the head, and a huge chest and shoulders.  It looked at me for maybe 1 minute, then went back down into the ravine.  Later that day it was making lots of sounds, like low grunts, my friend heard this as well. After that, it stayed in the Cuyahoga Valley area all summer, and I would often hear it calling, smashing rocks together, knocking on trees, and one day it sneezed a lot. Another day in September my cousin was using my large tractor to mow under the trees behind my house, and as I walked to my car from behind my house, I heard a terrific crash to my right, and there it was again, it had knocked over a tree and then I saw it run back into the ravine. I did not see any tracks, because since I knew it was down in the ravine most of the time I left it alone. It only recently seems to have left the area.

"Being out in the wooded area since around 7 AM, it was around 10 am, give or take an hour....I had left my watch in the car. I've been hearing activity in the brush for a while, I decided to seek a higher spot on the terrain to get a better view, so I was ascending this small knoll, or very small hill. As I crested the top, there it was, directly in front of me, and about 30-40 feet away. It was kneeled down, like a human does to tie its shoe, on one knee. As quickly as I saw it, it stood up, and we just stared at each other, eye to eye, for a few seconds that to me seemed like many minutes. I think somehow it knew it startled me, then I was overcome by this very strange feeling of calm. Within a minute or possibly less, it just turned and strolled into the dense part of the woods. It didn't seem scared of me, and looked back only once before it went out of sight. I opened my pack, yanked out my audio recorder, dropped it on the ground, had to reinstall the batteries, set my pack on the ground, and headed off after the creature. I roamed those woods for several hours only to hear some possible noises, but never saw it again....several times later that afternoon, while trying to locate my pack again, I heard sounds in the brush around me. sometimes it sounded like on two sides, not sure if the sounds were from small mammals, or possibly a couple of creatures. I never found my pack, and had to give up the search as darkness was coming soon. As for the creature, it was a male, looked young, around six feet tall. Its hair color appeared to be a light milk chocolate. It was stocky, by mans comparison, yet not really thick and bulky. the hair or fur was only about 2 inches long.","Very near the Grand River State Game Preserve, also near the Grand River, and west of the Mosquito Creek reservoir.",Trumbull County,Ohio,Summer,Report 9129: Man has close encounter very near the Grand River State Game Preserve,41.42579,-80.89096,8/7/2004,9129,Class A,dpq7xm348n,74.86,65.015,55.17,50.17,0.66,0.37,0.74,0,0,,1017.52,Partly cloudy throughout the day.,7,9.84,316,1.39
A friend and I had decided to go fishing one morning after working the night shift. We arrived at eagle creek around six thirty it was still very dark out but had our lanterns with us. As we stopped the car and got out we walked to the back of the car to get our equipment as soon as my buddy popped the trunk lock we heard a horrible scream and what sounded like someone yelling but the speech was backwards this sent chills down our backs. The sound came from the area we were headed. We waited a few seconds and tried to think of an explanation of the sound but couldn't come up with any thing. We fished  till morning light and then decided to walk the creek edge. We came across a sand bar with a lot of  mussels attached to some shale rocks that protruded up from under the sand as we got closer we saw signs that something had been digging at the mussels at first I thought this could have been any animal doing this but as we got even closer we saw two very detailed foot prints in the sand. There is no doubt in ether of our minds that someone had walked in the sand with bare feet. The prints were approximately 12 to 13 inches what puzzled us was what was someone doing out at six thirty in the morning in early spring with an outside  temp around 35 degrees because we had very heavy clothes on because of the cold and the prints led straight up a four foot embankment and into some very heavy thorn brush the kind that a you can't even walk threw  with out ripping your cloths to shreds. We walked the rest of the creek but couldn't find any other signs or prints.,I am not sure of the exact location but my buddy knows exactly where it is.

"My girlfriend and I left Akron about 1:00 PM to head south for the afternoon. My room mate had given us directions to a waterfall in a little-known back road park on the edge of Tuscawaras and Stark Counties. His directions weren't so great, and we couldn't find the place and ended up in the small town of Winesburg. After looking around we decided to head back, however we decided to ""get lost"" for some fun and took a couple of turns without noticing any street names. We eventually found ourselves on a class two state highway in Dundee, OH area. Heading north we passed a state gameland office on the left, and I started looking for a parking area to take a hike. I'm an avid hunter, and love the wildlife area's here in Ohio as they normally have nice trails and roads to hike around on. We came up on a set of railroad tracks from the south, and right before the tracks on the left there was a small one lane dirt road. It was marked as state game land, so I turned down it. It went down a hill, skirted along a swampy region, and then turned west a bit. The parking area was about 3/4 of a mile to a mile from the main road I'd say, and the road continued on past the parking area but there were signs saying no vehicles were allowed past that point. At the time we were the only ones there and got out to take a walk. We started out on the road past the parking area. It took us to the railroad tracks, and we crossed them. The road continued on from there, and took a small branch in the road. We first went right, and hiked a while. This branch of the road went towards the swamp, and was quite overgrown. We never really stopped to listen, but eventually turned around and took the fork in the road that went higher up the hill away from the swamp. This led to a very overgrown field, and we skirted along the West edge along the woods and along the edge of the hill that overlooked the swamp. At the end of the field, I decided to walk into the woods and stop and listen just to observe what was around, as I usually do when hunting. This is when it happened.  Across the swamp about 150 yards, we heard three loud evenly spaced knocks on what sounded to be a rather large tree. They occurred about three knocks in two seconds, I'd say. A couple of seconds later we heard three more knocks from what seemed a larger distance, probably 250 yards or more. After a short pause I brought my girlfriend's attention to the sounds. At that time we heard three more large knocks from in front of us, followed by three more louder knocks from the left. At this point, three knocks came from our right from across the body of the swamp. The water I'm sure obscured my judgment of distance, but with that in consideration now I'd say they were maybe 200 yards away. At this time, we heard four louder knocks from in front of us, then three to our left. At this time I felt uncomfortable enough to say I wanted to get out of there. After walking at a high rate of speed out of the area for a few hundred yards, I felt we were out of danger. My love for trains took over, and we walked for a 100 yards or so up the tracks to the south through a large rock cut and back to the path. We headed back to the car, and came across a puddle and I was showing my girlfriend a frog when all of a sudden the sounds came back. I don't know if whatever created the sounds on the far side of the swamp had moved, or if what we had perceived as the sound coming from our right was now in front of us.  In any case, we heard three more knocks from straight across the swamp from us, and then three more from our right again across the swamp. Distance was too hard to judge as we immediately started heading for the car. I knew there was a swamp in between us but I didn't like sticking around. On the way out we crossed paths with two hunters in camo and armed with bows. I said hello, but didn't bother mentioning the sounds as at the time I hadn't thought much about it. During the whole incident the thought of the possibility of Bigfoot crossed my mind, but I didn't let it stay long. Afterwards, while thinking about what happened, I said something to my girlfriend about how strange the sounds were, and that maybe it was Bigfoot. She shockingly agreed, saying she had seen TV reports of similar instances involving Bigfoot. I must admit a history of being very interested in Bigfoot as a whole, but never have I experienced something like this. I know of no animal that communicates like this. We both agree that it seemed like communication, either to us or to each other. The sounds seemed too big for humans to make, and the knocking was quite deep in pitch, indicating a larger sized tree. On return my room mate said he had indeed heard stories of people having encounters in that area, and I immediately turned here. I hope someone can validate this encounter, or at the very least tell me what other type of woodland creature communicates by regular banging on trees",North of Dundee off of State Route 93.,Tuscarawas County,Ohio,Fall,Report 5076: Multiple wood on wood sounds heard in the Beach City Wildlife area,40.6298,-81.5693,10/12/2002,5076,Class B,dpjzpu7j9x,60.57,57.09,53.61,54.54,0.89,0.85,0.23,0,0,,1020.28,Overcast throughout the day.,3,6.9,144,1.79

"On June 20, 2004, at 2 AM, I was lounging in my recliner watching TV. I noticed something like a large dark shadow looking in my window. We have four full length windows with no curtains because our family room faces the woods. I had no lights on other than the TV and my fish aquarium. The moon was slightly giving some light but not enough do make out any features. At first, I thought I was just imagining this. Slowly, I turned off the TV. When I did, the shadow moved over. I thought it was my imagination so I covered my head a went to sleep in my recliner. The next morning at 6 AM, I was still unnerved. When I looked toward the window, there was two large hand prints on the glass about 12 inches long. My brother wears a size 14 ring and these fingers were about four inches longer than his hand. It looked like a very large mans hand with fingers spread apart. I am retired from a Police Department and worked in fingerprinting and latent examination. I called my two brothers to come to my house and went into the bedroom to wake up my husband. I trembled in fear for about an hour afterwards. This thing had to be at least eight to nine feet tall to be standing where it was. I showed the handprints to my entire family. I did not want to report this because I am a foster parent and I was afraid people would think I'm crazy. On July 20, 2004, my dogs were screaming wildly. That night, my brother had stayed over since he was sick and was sleeping in the spare bedroom. At 4 AM, something was beating on the walls of my house so hard it knocked items off a shelf over the bed and dislodged my vinyl siding. This was new siding just installed in the spring! Needless to say, we were up all night. I was talking to my brother a few nights later at around 1 AM when I noticed another set of handprints on the window. Being a trained fingerprint technician they appeared to be not human and showed very little or no detail at all. The next day, we decided to clean these prints off our windows. We figured whatever left them would be back and leave some more. We used pure vinegar to clean the prints. Whatever was on its hands did not want to come off! It took some serious scrubbing to finally remove them. Other than the handprints, my windows were actually very clean. I have lived here for four years. My foster daughters told us twice that they were seeing a big man around our 1.5 acre pond. I didn't believe it was anything like this! We live in the country. Ever since we bought a large dog kennel to keep the dogs from running around this thing is getting brave enough to look into our windows and hit the house.

"My family owns a home on Chazy Lake in the northeast corner of the Adirondacks.  I spend many weekends there and often wake up early on Monday morning in order to get into work (about 1 hour away).

"My girlfriend and I were driving home from work in the winter of 2003. We had several inches of snow, so we were moving slow. I was driving down State RT 56.  I looked to the farm field on my left and noticed something walking along the creek. I slowed down to get a better look and asked my girlfriend if she could see what I was watching.  She said yes.  I pulled our truck over as far as I could get and got out.  I walked across the road to get a better look.  What we saw plain as day was covered in reddish brown hair, walked upright, had a conical shaped head, long arms, stocky build and was at least six feet tall.  We watched this thing for several minutes until we had cars backed up.  I got back into the truck and we turned off of the road to the next left where the creek crossed and the ditch turned into a small thicket which is the direction what we both agreed, without a doubt was bigfoot, was heading.

"I had fed deer out on our property for about 2 years.  One day my girlfriend and I were back along the gas well road that brings you about 2000 feet off the main road.  I was checking to see if the deer had been eating the cracked corn I left them.  Most of the corn had been eaten. I turned around to look back towards my truck and next to the gas well road was a large tree that was about 30 feet off the road. Next to the tree was a very tall, wide shouldered, very built, dark brown, hairy creature standing next to it.  The creature had pushed a fairly large branch away from its face so that he could watch us.  All I could do was stand there for a few seconds which seemed like hours staring back at the creature.

"I have never told this story to anyone besides my immediate family members because I tend to doubt myself. I believe there could be such things as Bigfoot, although I am not sure. I even went on an amateur investigation with my family last year in Salt Fork--we never saw anything but heard what we think were some other explorers whooping like us. I have hesitated to say anything because I don't want people to think I am making it up since I have been very vocal about my fascination with the subject to my students and friends. But seeing that someone else thinks they saw a Bigfoot near Meander Reservoir makes me want to tell my story too. Anyway, I am originally from the Youngstown area, although I live in Cleveland now. My husband, daughter, and I often travel to Youngstown to visit family in that area. On a drive home last year (it was in late March--the last time we went home before my father died) I swear I saw a huge figure standing flush with the treeline overlooking Meander. I was in the passenger seat so I got a decent look. We were driving over the bridge heading toward the turnpike to go back to Cleveland. The figure was huge--very tall and hairy. It was standing up and holding onto a tree looking out over the water. The location was among the trees along the bank closest to the bridge, if that makes sense. I'm not good at distances, but I was close enough that I could see it wasn't a person just from the massiveness of it. I have seen a lot of bears, and although some have been making their way into Ohio lately, it definitely wasn't a bear. I was in disbelief--I have always wanted to see a Bigfoot but I was speechless at the time it was actually occurring. I did say to my family ""I think I just saw a Bigfoot!"" but they didn't believe me. I talk about it once in a while, but since it happened so fast, and mostly since I had no clue it was possible for them to be in this area, I have convinced myself that I must have been mistaken. Now I don't think I was.","I-80 bridge over Meander Reservoir--heading West toward the turnpike.

"I was with my friends at one of their houses. We were spending the night in a tent in his back yard and we had a small fire going.

We could see it since the corn was recently harvested down to the stalks. The creature appeared for about 20 seconds and then looked in our direction and took off into the woods.

"My sighting first took place on my property in February of 2009. I had numerous contacts along with various evidence found and seen on the ten heavily wooded acres where I reside. 1st sighting. Feb 6th approximately 11:30 PM. Went out on the back deck to smoke a cigarette. There was a full moon and around 4inches of snow on the ground. The temperature was in the single digits. My family have been living at this location and I am familiar with the wildlife and sounds in the woods. I first heard movement in the woods that sounded like something extremely large. The snow was crunching and large branches and small trees were being broken. ( loud cracks like a gun fire) I was saying aloud: ""what the hell is out there!). As it moved closer I could see some of the smaller tree tops shaking. This activity continued until it was about 20 feet from the woodline. At that point it stopped. The full moon reflecting off the snow illuminated the entire area enough to play a baseball game but I could not see what was within the woodline. I vocalized aloud: "" why can't I see it"". Then another ash tree began to shake near the fence line. The ten acres of woods on my property is surrounded by another 50 heavily wooded acres as well so there is plenty of mature forest and dense cover. Then I heard a loud crack and a small ash tree slowly fell along the fence line. I still did not have a clue as to what this could be. (bigfoot did not even come into consideration). After the tree fall I went into the house, locked the door and went upstairs to alert my wife and see if we could get a better look from the second floor window. I woke my wife and raised the window facing the wooded area. My wife and I both could hear movement in the woods which was clearly bi-pedal, again large branches breaking. My wife suggested that I go out in the morning and look for prints in the snow to identify it. We do not have bear in this region of Ohio so I was mystified as to what it could be. The next morning I went out to investigate and discovered 9inch wide by 17 inch long bigfoot tracks. I could not believe it! I used a carpenters square and to reference the size and took digital pictures of the foot prints in the snow. I followed the tracks thru the woods which looked like a tornado passed through. 6inch diameter hardwood trees broken over, briar brush flattened ending at the 5 foot tall barbed wire fence at the rear of my property crushed down to a foot high. The barb wire was broken and stretched out straight as a frozen rope. We have a heavy deer population and I believe it was pursuing a deer. I found a hair sample on the barb wire. ( concealed as evidence in a zip lock bag. ) From there I found additional tracks which lead me to a fresh deer kill. There is no hunting on my property or the adjacent properties. The first thing that I noticed was the legs on the deer had been removed and the lower jaw was ripped off . All of the internal organs were missing yet no entrails or blood were found. I taking pictures of deer carcass and the bigfoot prints near the deer when I noticed the lower portions of the deer legs stacked together against a large tree. all of the legs were in the same direction like a bundle of dowel rods and there was clearly an imprint in the snow where ths sasquatch sat down in the snow against this tree and enjoyed his meal and neatly stacked the lower portions by the tree. At that point I turned to take a picture for evidence when a large stick flying end over end hit me on the back of my head and knocked my ball cap off. Thats when I realized this bigfoot is still out here. I grabbed my cap and ran out of the woods to the house. This story is just the beginning of an amazing six months of encounters and upclose sightings of an eight foot tall bigfoot that was very comfortable on my property and my family.

"My husband and I were on our way home late one night when I saw the headlights of the car shine on something crossing the road.  I shouted to my husband ""DID YOU SEE THAT?"" He said, ""See what?""

I was in total shock that night when I saw something really tall with long straight hair all over, dark rusty brown, and had a long stride as it crossed the road.  I was trying to see if it were a hunter dressed in some hunting outfit, but then remembered that it was March and NOT hunting season.

"My friend  lives outside of Cardington. It was about 6:00 P.M. when I got to his house and we decided to build a small camp fire just for the sake of fun. He lives right next to a small wooded cliff that follows a tiny  river. Right behind his house next to the cliff that leads into the small woods is his security light that stays on all night. It was about 9:40 P.M. that night and we had a really good camp fire going when he said “we are just about out of wood… do you think you could take the flash light and pick up some small twigs to keep this fire going.” At the time I really didn’t think anything of it and being a hunter and all I’m not scared of going into a woods at night. So, I said “sure” and took the flash-light and proceeded down a cut path on the face of the hilly cliff. The first step I took heading down that hill I will never forget for the rest of my life. As I took my first step onto the path I saw a massive black object/thing at the bottom of the cliff in a wall of weeds taller than me. Now, I’m about 6’ 1” and this black thing was a good 8 feet in height or taller. The weeds at the bottom were it stood are a good 7’ in height or longer themselves. With said, I just stood there froze in fear asking the same question in my head ‘what the hell is it?’ As I stood there it just moved side to side like a large animal studying it’s pray for the kill. At that time it looked up at me with its red eyes and that is when my heart dropped to the bottom of my small intestine. The red eyes on this thing glowed off the security-light at the top of the cliff and I was just scared shitless. After about two minutes of just standing their motionless, I finally managed to move my arm in a backwards motion to touch my friend on the shoulder. When I did that Josh said “what” and turned towards me where he got a fearful look at this thing as well. He then yield “shit” and took off for the door to his house leaving me just standing their thinking ‘o-shit he just left me hear by myself with this thing.’ About that time this large bear/human looking thing just took off running in a mad run for the riverside; crossing it towards the field on the other side. When that happened I took off towards the house door as I fell over myself just turning around. As for what I seen that night I really can’t say. But I do know one thing and that is it was no person or animal I’ve ever seen. I would also just like to add that later this past week myself, my friend, and some college friends took a walk down into the woods in the middle of the night where we discovered and photographed three large footprints coming up out of the river bed.",Just outside Cardington.,Morrow County,Ohio,Winter,Report 10863: Two young men have a sighting while tending a campfire near Cardington.,40.50945,-82.87663,1/13/2005,10863,Class A,dpjn6ne0ds,63.6,45.615,27.63,47.17,0.79,0.57,0.12,0.024,1,rain,1005.93,Breezy until afternoon and rain starting in the afternoon.,2,8.21,199,11.67

"It was July 17,2009 an evening i'll never forget.me and my older brother Michael were enjoying a night of fishing at a spot we frequented on many other occasions.the location was just west of the DAM at west branch reservoir on a secluded point that was only accessable by one road which was a dead end turn around where you have to park. our location was approximately 2.2 miles from the intersection of booth road and new milford road. it seemed to be a very peaceful night of fishing,the water was so calm and the air so still and quiet. after about an hour of letting our bait soak i decided to practice a little coyote/predator calling. its a perfect spot for predator calling because of the great distances the calls travel over the lake and beyond,you can really get some great responses from the local predators.

I was in a hunting chair back in some thicket I went in the woods about 5:30 about 8:00 I fell asleep in the chair around 8:45 heard some noise I thought was a deer I waited for a minute didn't here anything so I stood up and something started knocking over trees screaming running away at first I thought I scared a deer but deer will take an open trail or thicket to get away this was knocking over 3 inch trees and growling. I tried to follow the noise but it was gone in seconds so I headed back to my truck on my way back a buddy I was hunting with said he found a very big foot print it was in a foot of grass but one print pushed the grass down to the mud and you can see the print he was tracking a deer and found the print.,1/4 mile north on 127 from 725 left on Summer Rd.,Preble County,Ohio,Fall,Report 40315: Possible encounter and print find while deer hunting near Camden,39.65361,-84.66399,11/15/2012,40315,Class B,dp5c96tx40,45.16,35.97,26.78,27.78,0.78,0,0.07,0,0,,1028.5,Foggy overnight.,3,2.82,4,0.63
"I've been an avid outdoorsman in the Pike and Ross county areas for years. (Bow Hunting) On many, many occassions I have heard the growls, screams, holwls, and drum-like beatings; mostly in the early morning hours between (1am and 3am). Several times I have observed ""something"" moving across the edge of my vision, and when I tried to find tracks, or make a determination as to what actually occured; the only thing that I could find was scratch marks high up on trees. Since there are no grizzly bears in that particular area, it was easy to guess what made these tears in solid wood. INCIDENT: Near Lake Jackson (SE of Waverly): My friends and I were hunting/camping beside an old gravel pit surrounded by high cliffs and ponds. During the late evening hours we all smelled a peculiar ""wet dog/skunk"" odor emmanating from across the small pond. My best friend and I armed ourselves (feral dog do roam the area) and proceeded to the other side of the pond. There is a small dike that runs from one side to the other. Halfway across the dike there was a series of frightening growls coming from the edge of the treeline. Immediatley after bushes and medium size trees were being violently shaken, as if in a warning for us to stay away. (We took the advice and retreated back to our side of the pond) The rest of the night was spent listening to soft moaning, somtimes howls, and on one occassion rocksw and tree limbs sailed across the pond towards us. The next morning we once again armed ourselves and checked out the area across the pond. There were no trail-signs, no hair, nothing that would indicate a track. (And-I am a decent enough tracker). Throughout the next few years I returned to that area many times, and always had this very keen sense that I was being watched. Sometimes to the point that my hair would stand on end. There are still certain deep hollows (600' deep) that I ABSOLUTELY) will not go into. In one particular hollow; everytime I go down into it, there seems to be a sense that I am in danger. A survey of the area was startling: The hollows; which range from 25' to 900' deep, run along the entire region into WV and parts of PA. One could litteraly walk state to state, and never emerge into sunlight. I have since moved from Ohio to Wyoming. and I am sure the locals (many of whom have substantiaed my thoughts on this) still hear the screams and wolf-like howls.",Near and around Lake Jackson.

I was hunting in the area and was coming back down the trail when I looked up and saw something in the trail walking into the woods and looking up the trunk of a tree. I walked closer to see what it was and there was a creature about seven to eight feet tall standing and it was staring me down. I thought it was going to attack me. I was frozen with fear. It just stood there so I started to walk in the other direction when it let out a screeching howl. I stopped and my heart was racing and I couldn't breath. I turned back around and it was about 20 feet from me. I got the idea to slowly put my gun on the ground to show I wasn't going to mean it harm. The creature started to walk towards me so I stood very still. It looked at me with big brown eyes. It started to walk away and I tried to follow but it started running too fast.,The closest road is State Route 772 and State Route 50.

"About three weeks ago I was walking down south Leighton St. on my way home. It was around 9:45 or 10:00 PM. As I was crossing the bridge I heard a splash in the water under the bridge. I go fishing under the bridge all the time so I'm not scared to go under there. I decided to see who was down there so I walked down the side of the bridge to get down there and when I got to the edge I didn't see anyone on the bank so I thought it was a fish splashing. The river is not that deep..three maybe four feet. I started to walk directly under the bridge and I heard the splash again. Standing in the middle of the river was a big huge hairy ape looking thing. It didn't look like what I thought a Bigfoot would look like. That is if it was a Bigfoot. As soon as I seen it the words holy s**t just came out my mouth. The darn thing heard me and turned around and started running through the water towards me, making a weird gurgling noise. I hauled a** up the side of the bridge and ran across the railroad tracks and fell and cut my elbow open. I went home told my mom and she thought I was on drugs. After that night I would make evry effort to avoid walking across that bridge at night. Who ever said these things will not harm you are full of it.

"This is the second time I've seen one. The first was at a campground about 20 years ago by Mohican state park (Ohio).  I left the campfire to check on the kids. We were camping with a few other families and the tents were basically in a circle.  As I passed the tent next to mine there was what i take to be a young bigfoot (about my height, which is 5'7"") I would call it grayish brown, not like an ape, the facial features were flatter, more like a person's (not the big jaw an ape has). I stopped dead in my tracks and it stared at me and I stared at it. It frightened me since I didn't expect to see it but it never moved, giving me the impression it was just as scared. I went back to the fire and it disappeared. The second time was two nights ago.  It has been very hot the last few days so I was staying up later to do wash and put it in the dryer.  It was about 11:45 pm I was loading the dryer and glanced up at the open window to see a head and shoulders and the top of the back walking past the window. The window is about 6 feet off the ground so I guess it was roughly 7 feet tall.  It evidently bumped into something on the way because it knocked into the house. Personally I hate seeing it.  It scares me even if they are supposed to be harmless.   The second one was the same color, grayish brown, hairy, straight hair but obviously fur rather than human hair, more coarse looking. I don't tell people because they think you are nuts.

"My friend and I were heading down the trail on our mini bikes when we parked on the trail for a bathroom stop. We both went off to the left side of the trail and were still walking side by side. As we were walking, we were startled when a figure jumped out of a tree no more then 20-30 feet in front of us in the direction we were headed. The figure landed facing us on 2 feet and was very obvious it was like nothing we had ever seen before. I do not believe it was an adult due to the fact it was only about 5 ft. tall. It had brown hair all over its body and just stared at us. After about 5 seconds or so we freaked out and ran for our bikes and took off. We saw this thing in broad daylight at a close range.

I was on my way home from work at about 10:30 PM. I was heading east on Wilson Mills Rd. just approaching Chardon. I was especially alert due to the large number of deer in the area. To the right of me I saw a flash of glowing eyes in my headlights. I slowed down and looked into my rear view mirror and saw what appeared to be the silhouette of a very large man. It had stepped into the road behind me and I could clearly see it because the moon was full and very bright. There were no other cars on the road so I began to stop to get a better look. This thing looked to be nearly as tall as a stop sign with very thick limbs. It was walking upright but slightly bent. It proceeded to cross the street and disappeared into the trees. I drove home awestruck with the image burned into my mind. I decided to only tell my boyfriend what I saw and as I was sketching it out he went online and found this web site.

"I had been told about recent Bigfoot sightings in this area, so I’d been on the lookout for Bigfoot and sign ever since.  I knew that many sightings had occurred after rainfall.  One night last August, after a day of bad storms that ended by evening, on a whim I decided to drive to this park at night.  It was an eerie night with distant lightning flashes in the sky.  There’s a road that leads to a parking lot.  At one point the road sharply veers to the right into the parking lot.  If you were to go straight, you would be driving down a private drive. As I turned down this road, looking straight ahead down this private lane, I saw big eyes looking back at me.  There was one set of very large, close together, blue-white eyes high off the ground.  They almost looked cartoonish in shape, they were so large.  They were oval and sort of cocked toward each other like a cartoon figure.  They were totally unthreatening looking – in fact, my impression was of a gentle and frightened creature.  Halfway down this large creature I saw several smaller blue-white eyes.  I never saw a “pair”, though.  They were just random blue-white dots in several places halfway down the creature.  When I first saw the eyes, I stopped my car and just stared in disbelief.  The eyes didn’t move for several seconds.  Then the tall big-eyed creature’s eyes started to sway back and forth.  When it did that, the shorter eyes all started to move, appearing and disappearing and moving around in a smooth and floating manner.  I never saw figure shapes or fur.  Just eyes.  When everything started moving, I panicked unfortunately, turned my car around and got out of there as fast as I could.  What can I say?  I’m a female and I was alone at night in a park looking at strange eyes.  I went to my sister’s house 10 minutes from there and told her about it.  She got her son and his girlfriend, and the four of us went back to the sighting area to explore it with flashlights.  We saw nothing – no prints or sounds or smells.  However, it was a noisy night insect wise, but when we walked in the sighting area, it was eerily quiet.  Two things I noticed.  By seeing my nephew and sister in the same spot where I saw the eyes, it was apparent that the adult creature was much taller than they are.  Also, I was able to clearly see my relatives’ shapes and clothing.  I couldn’t see the creature’s shape, so it (they) must have been very dark from top to bottom.  My general impression was that I stumbled upon a female with her young children out walking around after the heavy rains that day.",Location edited at the request of the witness.,Geauga County,Ohio,Summer,Report 15088: Possible approach at night near Chesterland,41.50086,-81.28275,8/14/2005,15088,Class B,dpqhn758n9,73.64,69.295,64.95,68.18,0.91,0.78,0.31,0.0008,0.57,rain,1014.62,Mostly cloudy throughout the day.,4,6.73,30,1.67
"We moved to this location two years ago.  We only lived here a few weeks and my four year old came running into the house and said he didn't want to play outside anymore.  He seemed upset but not extremly frightened. When I asked him what was wrong he said he saw a monkey man looking at him through the trees.  I went out and nothing was there.  I looked around the area but didn't see anything.  My son took me to the tree and showed me where someone or something was looking at him from between a fork in the tree. That was two years ago.  Yesterday my oldest son aged 15 was standing in the living room and glanced out the picture window. He said something huge and black ran from some trees we have there to beside the garage.  I was kidding and said, ""Is it bigfoot?"" And he said very seriously, ""yeah, I think it was.""  I ran out the back door which is toward the opposite side of the garage than where whatever it was would be standing.  I ran behind the garage and to the other side but nothing was there.  I live near a heavily wooded area and the woods are close to the house behind and to one side of it.  The garage blocks the veiw of the yard and you can only see the front/side from the window. Whatever it was would have had plenty of time to run into the woods. Tonight my son's friend Bobby was visiting for the night and was outside getting things ready to build a fire when he called my husband from his cell phone to the house.  He thought my husband or son was playing a trick on him and trying to scare him.  He told him to come out and when my husband went out to him Bobby told him something big was running from tree to tree looking at him.  He said it was black and even though it was dark he saw the outline of the face.  Which is why he thought it was my husband or son. This would have been about 40ft ending to 20 ft away from him. He said it came from right outside the tree line from the yard and then went into the treeline running from tree to tree looking at him and getting closer to him. Like it was trying to hide from him but still keep an eye on him. When my husband came out Bobby turned away to ask him if my son was playing a joke.  When he turned back it was gone.  They came in and told me so we went out with the camera and took some pictures of the woods in the dark.  I don't know if I got anything or not. Whatever it is, from descriptions given to me, its about 6'-6'4 and since everyone says its about the size of my husband or son...husband is 6' 215 and son is 6' 240..

"I woke up on the morning of April 17, 2004, at about 5:45 AM and made my way out of the tent to make breakfast (I was on a camping trip with my father). As I got breakfast ready, I sat down to watch the water boil when I heard a loud scream/howl sounding very much like the Columbiana County, Ohio recordings on this website. As soon as I heard this I ran down a hill from my campsite to the North bank of Salt Fork Lake. On my way down I heard another howl. Both were slightly shorter than the Columbiana recordings but still the same sound. I know that they came from the southern bank and I would guess that they were most probably a mile or so away. I only heard the sound twice. I was still a little shocked and didn't tell my father until a few hours after he got up. The howls didn't wake up any campers that I know of. The two days before this incident I was walking on a trail and found a series of human-like footprints leading down the trail in the same direction I was traveling (west). I found one to still be in good condition so I cast it. It was of a left foot. It measured slightly over 12 inches long and was 5 1/2 inches wide.

"I get up every morning about 5:15 am to get ready for work. On this morning I got up a little early, so I decided to eat a banana. I wanted to look outside to see if there was any deer or rabbits outside. Out of the corner of my eye I caught a glimpse of a figure that was huge and black. I thought it was a deer at first, but the more I could see of it, I realized it wasn't. This thing stood up and walked right through the crab apple trees like nothing. Then out of the corner of my left eye, I could see another figure smaller in size, but still as black as the big one. It went running like a child after its parents through the crab apple bushes, kinda wobbling. As It moved through the bushes, I could see the trees shake back and forth hard. I wondered where the big one was and looked to my right, and there it was standing in some thick brush staring right at me in the window. I got sick to my stomach! We stood there staring at each other for less than a minute. I took one step back from the window, then it looked at my dog kennel, and started walking up the hill. The trees were shaking back and forth as far as I could see and then they were gone. The night before, I threw almost rotten bananas and cantaloupe into the back yard.

"My wife and I were having a picnic supper at Salt Fork State Park on August 18, 2004 at approximately 7:00 p.m.  After approximately 15 minutes we decided to hike down a path into the woods with our dog.

We were nearly 75 yards into the wooded area when we stopped and looked more closely to see what was making the noises.  The noise was heard again and I saw it, and began shouting at my wife, ""There it is!  There it is!"" Together we saw what appeared to be a nearly 8 foot tall, dark colored subject looking at us.  We watched it for about 10 seconds and then it walked upright, in a human form, deeper into the woods and away from us.

"I was catfishing by the spillway that runs out of Salt Fork Lake at around two o'clock in the A.M. I was only about 15 yards from my vehicle and had been there for about 1 to 2 hrs. I had a Coleman lantern which was lit and about 4 ft. away. The hole I was fishing is approx. 25 yrds across. On the opposite side is a small gravel parking lot. At the edge of the lot is a small line of sapplings. They are growing about 10 or 15 ft. above my line of site. At around two o'clock A.M. I had the strangest feeling that I was being watched. Now let me say this, I'm not an amateur outdoorsman. I was born and raised in the area and at one time hunted anything that walks, crawls or flies. Bowhunting for whitetail deer was my favorite thing to do for years. I've always been in tune with my surroundings when in the woods. At any rate, I had a headlamp on and that was my only source of directional light. Things were very quiet. No bug or frog noises that I can recall. That added to the erie feeling I had. I turned on my headlamp and scanned the line of sapplings across the water from me. I stopped when I lit up a pair of eyes staring straight at me. It was a little freightening at first but I told myself it was a deer. I kept the light trained on the eyes for about 30 secs. or so. They didn't so much as flinch. I then stomped my foot on the ground and snorted like a deer ( a sort of warning sound they emit when spooked). Typically this will cause a deer to give the same warning ""snort"" and abruptly run off. No such result. The eyes never diverted for a moment, There was still no movement or response of any kind. This is the point in time that I became quite concerned. Almost in a panic, I picked up several rocks and pitched them in the direction of the eyes. Once I'd thrown the third rock or so, the eyes moved away, directly back, like a person walking backward. This is also atypical of deer behavior. They always turn about 180 degrees and trot or run. There was still no noise as the animal did this. It then turned to its right (as best I could tell) and calmly, with no noise, walked toward the brush/ Wills Creek. I then quickly gathered my gear and left. I must say, I was fairly shaken up by the behavior of this animal. Keep in mind, my headlamp was only strong enough to light up its eyes and not whatever they belonged to. I would estimate the animal to be approx. 5.5 to 6 ft. in height. This also clued me in that whatever it was. It was not a deer. In the past I have also heard a sound like something beating a log on the side of a tree. I realize now this is primate behavior.

"It was Friday July 28,2006 at Salt Fork State Park in Cambridge Ohio. I was hiking with my dad, mom, 2 little sisters and my aunts niece. we have been into the whole bigfoot thing and decided that we would go hike and hopefully see him. well at about 6:30 pm or so we started hiking and had seen footprints. so we kept hiking hoping to see him, and as we were hiking i would here deep sounding grunts and out of the corner of my eye would see big dark figures moving. well we made it to the top of the hill which went to the road and my mom had told me that i would be to scared to walk back by myself so i did and my sister and cousin followed behind me. we started our way back into the woods and i ran down the hill and as i was waiting for my sister and cousin to make it down the hill, i got this feeling as if someone was watching me and i had got the goosebumps and there were no other sounds or animals around.it was about 7pm and i turned my head and saw a figure around the size of 8-10 feet tall on 2 legs, dark brown/black hair/fur and it had big yellowish eyes staring right at me. now i believe in bigfoot/sasquatch so i would say it was bigfoot. he was standing behind a big tree and was staring right at me with his big hand holding onto the tree. it was almost like he was peeking around the tree.i was so scared the i started walking faster and then into a run and my sister and cousin came running after me..... i stopped to catch my breath because i was crying n could hardly breath and looked over again and there he was again behind a rock. i had then told my sister that i had seen him and i thought he was following us. well my dad had told us if we see him to scream for him and run. well when i tried to scream nothing came out so we all ran about 2 miles back to our cabin. when we had gotten to the pavement my sister and cousin had came out and told me that they had seen him too but didn't tell me right away because they didn't want to scare me anymore. throughout our hike my sister and i heard grunts and would see tall figures but weren't positive of what they were.",over by cabin 53 u go down a hill and across a log and up the hill on the other side. walk on the trail closest to the lake and all the way up. there are huge rocks and trees...... as u walk u will be able to see a grassy area..... right before u get to the grassy area is where the sighting happened.,Guernsey County,Ohio,Summer,Report 15371: Possible sighting by teens in Salt Fork State Park,40.11632,-81.52101,7/28/2006,15371,Class B,dpnh0yynwb,83,77.59,72.18,70.2,0.78,0.66,0.11,0,0,,1015.45,Foggy starting in the afternoon.,5,1.79,225,1.66

"Me and my wife picked my mother up from work in Lima, OH at 2 AM. We were traveling down 117S/E and turned left on Philips rd. We were on our way home and drove across the second bridge when a dark shape on the south side of the road caught my attention, and apparently my wife and mother also. I had not said anything until they said they saw something, my suspicions were now confirmed. I stopped the car and backed up. Whatever it was appeared to have been laying in the ditch that goes under the bridge and when I backed the car up it appeared to get up and lean over as if shielding itself and seemed as if it realized we could see it. The creature stood up and rushed at our car. It seemed that it covered about 30 feet effortlessly, it was very fast I think we were all shocked. I floored the car without thinking. I asked them if it was still behind us. They said it had come out into the road behind us. I got the feeling that it had wanted to scare us off. I questioned my wife and mother about what they had seen. We all saw the same thing. I just seen the immense size of it and it looked like it had very coarse looking hair. My mother and wife said it had a very large belly and was of a very thick build.

"We have had sporadic, maybe a couple times a year, activity (sightings, tracks, screams, wood-on-wood, deer kills, bent and snapped trees) on our property in Harrison Co. for the last 25 years. We have had several reports filed with BFRO. The investigators think this may be a migratory route between two remote areas. We have not heard or seen anything much for about the last year and wondered if the activity had ended. We were there for the weekend last week and had some 10 overnight guests staying in our cabins. It had rained nearly all day on Saturday or up until about 2 to 3 PM. We retired around 1 AM. At about 3 to 4 AM Sunday morning, many of us were awakened by wood-on-wood. It hammered on and off for about 5 min. in series of 5 or 6 hits and all was again quiet. We could not really tell the direction nor the distance. All spoke of the noise the next morning and why someone would be making the racket. We explained what we thought that it was and all agreed that it made sense. What fool would be beating on a tree or log or cutting wood with an ax at that time of the morning since no one really is out in the wet woods on steep inclines. The neighbors don't burn wood. It was too warm for a fire anyway and who cuts wood with an ax anymore. Also, my large dog saw something after dark across the hollow the night before and went ballistic with his hair standing on end.

"In the summer of 2010, my family had met my sister and her family at the end of a bay at Tappan lake in Harrison county, Ohio. We were fishing at a point of the bay where you had to walk approximately 40 to 45 yards to the lake shore. My wife Amy had decided to walk back to our van for another chair and I decided to go with her because the trail was a bit winding through the woods. As we went, we heard a ""whooping"" sound not too far from our location. My wife asked me what it was and having never heard anything like it at the time and thinking rationally, I said it was an owl. Then, about a year later, while watching an episode of Finding Bigfoot, she heard the same sound that we heard that night at the lake.

The first was within 100 yards and the next two were fairly distant. Cj answered the scream and the nearest location returned the call. After about five minutes of silence we returned to fishing. About five minutes later we heard a loud splash that resembled a dense object landing in the water. I've heard ducks landing and beaver tails slapping on the water and these did not resemble that. It happened about four more times, so we decided to pack up and leave. On our way out we stopped where the path to the fishing area met the road.

"Hello, I live in Millersburg Ohio. On June 21st 2012, I was driving home from a nearby town called Loudenville on state route 39 going east toward Millersburg. West of a very small town called Nashville, on a straight away in the road, I saw something on the side of the road. I couldn't tell what it was for sure but thought it might be a man walking there. As I neared, whatever it was crossed the road (from left to right) a ways in front of me. What was weird is that I could tell it was there, but it seemed to blend into the woods, so it looked like a dark figure. It only took only three steps to cross the two lane highway. I slowed down as I passed the place it crossed and looked to my right where it had gone. By then I was almost stopped. When I looked up on the bank there was what I thought a man walking in the field...but as i looked I saw it was very big, and hairy. I thought it may be a hunter....but no clothes, no gun. I could see the hair shimmer as it walked. This thing walked like a man. It never turned around but kept on walking toward the tree line...it had hair from head to foot...it swung its right arm as it strode away and seemed to be unconcerned that I was there.  I got really scared that it might turn around so I drove away to the town of Nashville and called my son. No one believed my account until months later when I stopped at the farm where the field was...I told them what I had seen and assured them I wasn't crazy or a storyteller. To my surprise I had been the third person to come to them with almost the same account...they asked if I thought it could have been a bear....""No, beyond a shadow of a doubt....NO"". There is a game trail coming from the left where I first saw it. And one of the people who saw it went with the farmer to investigate but didn't find anything.

"Hello,  I live in Huntsville, Al. I have a friend who lives near Steubenville, Oh. She has told me that she has found large human-like footprints on her property several times over the past few years. Her son and nephew had a sighting of a Bigfoot a year ago. Now, she says that over the past week and a half or so, she has been experiencing some things. One of her sons and she went out in the woods behind her house 10 days ago or so, and she felt like she was being watched. Shortly afterwards, she smelled something that she described as ""rotting garbage."" Then, she heard a loud knocking noise nearby. She described it as sounding like a log being banged against a tree. She noticed leaves stripped off trees that were out of her reach. And, she said to me that the sounds, and the feeling of being watched have continued to the present time. I asked her if it was OK that I contacted you, and she said that was fine. I then asked her if she would be willing to talk to someone about these happenings. She said yes. But, she feels a little uncomfortable about this, and wants me to be sort of a liaison. I told her I would email this in, then you can contact me, and I'll keep her updated. I wanted to tell you ASAP, in case you had an investigator who could run by there before these happenings quit. I'm not sure at this time, but I think if the investigation was discreet, she would allow one on her property. I'll have to talk with her some more about that.

"I have been an avid hunter for over 25 years and I am convinced that bigfoots are out there. This encounter happened in mid to late october in the 2002 deer bow hunting season. I was working 2nd shift at the time. Their were four of us who experienced this. I got off work at about 11pm. picked up my hunting buddies and drove down to southern ohio where we hunt. We arrived at about 2:30 to 3:00 am. Parked the truck and decided our next move. Everyone was hardcore ready to go. I personally have no problem with cat-napping in a tree-stand , We piled out of the truck and proceded to get our hunting clothes and gear ready. Down the road in both directions (east-west) you could here two barred owls hooting back and forth. I personally thought nothing of it. I've heard and seen lots of owls and they did'nt sound any different than owls I've heard before. We got ready and then proceeded up the hill to where we were going to split up. This was a large hill we climbed and when we reached the top we followed the ridge out to where it converges into a larger ridge. When we reached the top of the hill we took a breather and I had noticed the two owls had crossed the road and were in the hollows on either side of us. One on one side one on the other. We caught our breath and proceeded to follow the ridge top to where we were headed. The owls followed us down the ridge in either hollow but now they were not only still hooting they were making one hell of a racket (branches breaking and stuff). Not like normal owls at all, let alone following us. We travel close to about a mile down the ridge to where we split up. The owls (which I don't think are owls anymore) followed us on either side the whole way. We get to the place where we are supposed to split up and stop. A couple of the guys ask me about the owls and all the stick snapping commotion as we came down the ridge. I tell them I have no clue other than maybe the owls were pushing deer. We talked about the hunt and where we would meet up at noon. unless one of us took a deer. We were there about 15 minutes and all of a sudden we here this noise that I can say kinda started as a growl that turned into a scream. This had to be close(within a hundred yards) because it was like you were at a rock concert and you feel the base drum reverberating in your chest. It was really loud! Everyone was like ""what the heck is that!"" We were all a little mortified and I think they did'nt want to split up. We waited about another twenty minutes trying to figure that scream out and get our nerve up. We decided to hunt anyway and all kinda joked about it being a couple of bigfoots and how if one of them came by our treestand we would kick it in the teeth. We split up and got into our treestands. It was probably about 4:30 now, I personally couldn't get over how quiet the woods were from then on out. The sun finally came up and I was pretty glad. We hunted until noon and then met up with each other. Everyone had the same story, It was absolutely death quiet until about 11:00am, no birds, no squirrels, no nothing, you could hear a pin drop. We decided to get out of there and hunt somewhere else. I firmly believe that the moment we stepped out of the truck that they were watching our every move and followed us. I think we got a little too close to one or more of their positions and they gave us a warning. I think they are nomadic in general and were just passing through that area. I'm hunting on over 2000 acres of private land that has lots of logging roads all through it. We have a lot of the locals tresspassing on atv's and railcars.

"My buddy and I use to do a lot of cat fishing along the banks of the Ohio river and during the winter we would fish down at the hot water discharge for DP&L since the boilers kept the water in the low to mid 80's. We'd arrive at dusk and fish until around 8-9 am the following morning. Depending on how cold it was we would sometimes build a small fire to keep warm and help us to see our lines. On this particular day it was very cold but relatively clear skies with little to no wind. After walking down the winding trail from the highway to our regular spot we began to setup our poles. I cast my lines out and began to gather kindling and driftwood for a fire. While walking the banks for wood I noticed small barefoot human like footprints in the sand just at the waters edge. They were approximately 5-6 inches in length but abnormally wide and surprisingly deep. I remember thinking that it was awfully odd that someone would allow their child to run around barefoot during the winter, especially in an area that was littered with random fish hooks and broken glass. I pointed it out to my buddy and we joked about it. We brushed it off as a freak occurrence and didn't discuss it any further.

"On the morning of May 10th 2009 me and my friends were camping at my girlfriends house in Mechanicstown, Ohio. Mechanicstown is in Carrol County, just bordering Columbiana County. We were out @ about 3:00 in the morning trying to get the fire going in the back yard. As we were lighting the fire, I heard a loud howling coming over the hills. I stopped and asked my cousin if he heard the noise too. At first he acknowledged hearing the dogs barking off in the distance. However, he did notice the howling I was talking about. We both stood at the fire and listened to the howling continue for a couple of minutes. We are not from around this area, so he asked me what I thought it was that might be howling like that. I told him it was probably a bear...but it was still some distance away...my estimate being 4-5 miles. We brushed the noise off, and went back inside. The next morning i tried as best as i could to describe the sound to my girlfriends parents, who are residents of the area. They told me they dont know what i heard...but it did not seem to resemble a bear because bears in this area do not howl like that. The next day, I happened to be watching MonsterQuest on the History Channel. It was about Bigfoot legends from around the US and they happened to play a clip from a unknown howling recorded in Columbiana County, Ohio in 1994. As soon as I heard the howling...i recognized it. It was the EXACT same sound we had heard the night before. I decided to google Columbiana County, Bigfoot, 1994 and actually found the clip of the sound on this website. I listened to it...and am 100% positive that was the exact noise i heard. I sent the clip to my cousin, and he too confirmed that was the noise that he heard as well.

"My mother and I went riding that day. Weather was nice and clear, just the right temperature to take a leisure ride through the park. Even the wind was with us, blowing behind us and keeping the bugs off. Since we didn't have anything to do that day we thought we'd take a longer trail. It's a stand of white pines. Not the one that leads to a campground, but one adjacent to a field. I don't remember the color designation or the exact name, we call it the hangman's trail due to a tree, but it may be the whispering pines. I was deep in thought, not really paying attention to my surroundings. I turned to see if my mother was alright, seeing as she was quite a ways behind me. My gelding tensed, which instantly had me turning around to see what was wrong. My first impression was an object standing vertically. I figured a tree top had fallen down and was being propped up by a log. I waited for Goke to figure this out and settle. Boy was I wrong. It moved, we moved. Goke swirled around and went off at a dead run. He generally starts and stops, like running in place when he spooks. He stops, settles, and investigates. Even when a dog was attacking him he never ran so fast and so uncontrolled a gallop. He practically bulled over mom and her horse, and soon the mare was following and the two horses didn't stop until we were halfway back to camp. So whatever it was scared the shit out of him. While Goke was running I still had my head turned looking at the object. It ran off towards the field, whether it exited the forest or not I'm not quite sure, we entered the pines blocking my vision. A break in the forest directed sun in my face at the initial sighting, so more or less I got a blurred perception of the creature as we both changed position. But it was enough to tell me this was no deer or man. One, whatever it was ran upright. The proportions looked wrong for a man, bulk in the wrong place. Height was also an issue. We still use that trail and the landmarks are still there for comparison. Looking at the log it was standing behind I'd say it was 7-8 feet. It was dark, but the 'halo' around it made the edges appear a dark chocolate. Mom said I was white as a ghost and Goke was jittery for the rest of the ride. We must have been pretty shook up seeing as mom told a friend to explain what was wrong. It's just not in her nature to relate things such as this.","I'm sorry, but it's been a rather fruitless search online for the bridletrail map. I know they have a pamphlet with the trails but I haven't found it online. So I'll try to describe how to get to the point. You follow orange trail until you come to large opening that leads to a section of the creek. across from the opening you can see high cliffs. Cross it and you come to a large island, which you go right off of into a small trickle of the creek and onto a rather stony bed. Which you cross another creek to a forested area full of hemlocks. There is (or was, I haven't gotten down there this year) an old tree with a phone set in the middle. If you see that, you're on the trail. You just follow the trail until you come to a fork. In front of you is a straight path, usually mowed, stating no tresspassing. The right is a trail I've never really been on, and the left is the trail to the pines. Naturally you want to go left. Go through the white pines, and when you come out of them there should be an old log lying on its side right in your line of sight.

"In the month of June 2008 I was camping with my partner and her sister at Beaver Creek State Park, Columbiana County, Ohio. I had camped and hiked in that park since I was a little kid, and felt comfortable there and knew the woods, trails, area well. We had been camping for 2 days, and were on our second evening. We had a campsite in the ""pines"" side of the campgrounds. In the evening, around 8:30, I went a ways into the woods behind our site to ""answer the call of nature"" so to speak. While I was going number one I heard a loud crash, it startled me as I thought it sounded like a deer crashing off. I jumped up, and saw a dark very muscular figure hurrying off quickly in the direction diagonal to our site and our camping neighbor. It was very dark, with bulging deltoid muscles. I could not get in my head what the heck was happening, as it was human form but appeared like it had no clothes on, plus black. The figure moved quickly, without reaching up to brush branches away like most people would do going thru the woods. It headed back toward where there's nothing but a steep drop off ravine. I told my girlfriend and her sister, both were scared and wanted to leave. I insisted on staying as I was so fascinated at what I thought I saw. We spent a restless night and got rained out the next morning, quickly waking up before dawn. We haven't camped there since. I now live in Powell, north of Columbus and have only camped at A.W. Marion State Park.

"About a couple years ago my dad and I heard this sound which sounded like a women screaming like she was getting raped or something. After that day we started to hear it more often about three times a summer. Well, three days ago, I had a bunch of my friends come over and we were going to try and get a picture of whatever was making the sounds. When three of my friends went ahead of the group a ways like they were going to try and scare us the rest of the group turned around and went back to the house and decided to wait and listen for it before we went looking for it because it was pretty cold and it was supposed to start raining. Well, the three kids who went ahead to try to scare us didn't know that we had turned back and so they waited crouched in the woods waiting for us. As they were waiting they heard something behind them in an old cabin that has fallen in and starting to decay. When they shined the flashlight behind them at the object, they saw the silhouette of an enormous object. My one friend, who is about 6 ft. 5 in. tall, said the objet was just as tall as he was, at least. They didn't get a very good look at it, though, because as soon as they saw it they turned and ran about a quarter mile back to the house as fast as they could.

"On Saturday, October 9th, 2010, I was finishing up a senior photo shoot at Lake Romona on Clearcreek Rd in Fairfield County, Ohio. Upon arrival at the lake, immediately we observed rocks being thrown into the lake. There were three of us who witnessed it, my wife and young son had gone up another trail however and they were not present. My photo subject and I had gone to the lower area to try and get a few shots, but the rock throwing continued. Also observed was tree knocking and limb breaking by the creature at this time and after we had gone back to where we originally heard it. We were across the lake from it, and at that time I had decided to take a quick succession of pictures to try and find what was throwing the rocks at us. At this point in time, all of us decided to leave the area. Since I had my wife and young son with me, I didn't want to run the risk of them getting hurt. It was when I got home that I realized that I had actually gotten  two images of the creature. I also believe that I have another of it observing me when I was taking the picture of the boy in front of the lake, but it is not as clear as the other two. To me in the photos its face resembled an orangutan, only it was completely black. Also of interest is that the creature appears to have something white in its hand.","From Tarlton, follow 159 and turn right onto Julian Rd. Right to Drinkle then left onto Clearport Rd.

"I was traveling on Little Kyger road toward Ohio state route 7 when I popped over a steep hill located one this stretch of road and as my headlights shown back down on the road as I topped the hill, along side the road there is a tree and a road sign, thats when I noticed this large very dark figure along the road with what appeared to be either very dark brown or black fur/coat?? it was a head taller than the road sign that it was walking in front(6 to 7 foot tall) of, it looked as if it was getting ready to cross the road out of a very wet swampy marsh area over into more wooded hills. As my lights hit it as with out thinking it turned back the way it had come very swiftly, but another interesting thing that i noticed was as it tuned to go back into the swampy area I could plainly see the entire bottom of its foot wich was very  very large and light in contrast to the rest of the creature and void of any fur/coat would very much put you in the mind of a humans foot only much much larger. and within just flash was gone.I did stop the following day to see if I could see any kinda of tracks and saw nothing but the composition of the ground would probably not yeild a good footprint next to the road as for the marshy area I didnt venture in..Very strange indeed.","It is about 2 miles out Little Kyger road off of Ohio state route 7 in the cheshire ohio area, over a dip in the road just past the old high school (River Valley )..",Gallia County,Ohio,Winter,Report 28912: Motorist traveling near the Ohio River has bigfoot sighting outside Chesire,38.9264,-82.14285,2/22/2011,28912,Class A,dnvt6y36sy,33.59,31.76,29.93,29.68,0.9,1,0.66,0.0002,0.39,snow,,Foggy until afternoon.,3,3.13,347,1.23

He was about to shoot him and he heard something coming toward him the buck ran off. Dad stood up and yelled you scared my deer off your on my land.

"My family and I were driving home early in the morning between 2 and 3 A.M. We took a shortcut down HW 63 which runs between Haleyville,Ok and Kiowa, Ok. The Highway now is paved, but at the time of our encounter it was a well maintained dirt road. The road had many curves and hills. We were traveling around 40-50 mph. We crossed over a hill and right below the hill was a small bridge. On this bridge was a creature that was standing to the right of our pickup as we passed by. The creature was between 6-7 ft. tall and had brown shaggy hair all over it similar to an irish setter dog. As we passed, I looked at the creature right in the face. His face resembled that of an old man's. More human than apelike. I could see that the creature's face had wrinkles and very little hair around it's eyes and nose. The creature had no neck and it looked as if his head was just plopped up on his shoulders. I felt like we surprised the creature and once he finally saw us, he had nowhere to go. I remember seeing him stand real stiff against the bridge's railing as we passed. I asked my mother to turn around and see if we could get a better look at this mysterious creature.

"The sighting occured around l0 pm at night, we live in a very rural area of Adams County, Ohio, we have a house on 60 very wooded acres.  My wife was sitting a watching TV, as were we all, we have a back window near the TV some l0 feet from where we sit, my wife suddenly said that there two eyes staring at her thru the window.  I first thought she was joking, but she wasn't, I got up and went to the window, which was closed, as it was cold, and opened the window and could not here anything or see anything, but it was dark.  At about the same time as my wife said she saw the eyes, my oldest son was getting up to go outside on our front screen deck porch, as I was at the window, my son had just gone out the sliding glass door to the porch and was lighting a cigarette, as I turned away from the window, my son, opened the door and was yelling for me as he was pointing out the porch to the separate garage building that is next to our house, he dropped his cigarette and stood there looking for a few seconds and then quickly came into the house saying that he had just seen a big hairy thing looking around the corner of the garage in his direction.  This got us all excited and somewhat scared, I had just had a knee operation so I did not go outside to investigate, I did however get a gun out and load it.  I went onto the porch but I did not here or see anything.  I was convinced that my wife and son had seen the samething, as it could have walked across the back of the house and garage and come around the corner within that time frame.  My wife described the eyes as very close together and a glowing green color and larger than a humans eyes.  My son described the creature as being very dark in color, with the hair very long and hanging down over its face, he couldn't make out any facial features.  Our deck/porch is some 4 feet raised off the ground with the garage on the ground, based on my sons description of the height of the head in relation to the basketball hoop that was on the front of the garage, the thing was in the 7-8 feet tall range.  The next day I went out looking for any signs, I found nothing at the window or behind the house and garage area at the corner, I walked across a grass field that extends out from the side of the garage and did find what appeared to be a faint impression of a very large foot in a hard clay/sand non grassy spot.  I measured and copied the imprint the best I could, I have it somewhere in a notebook, but do remember it being some 16 inches in length and some 10-12 inches in width across the top, the impression was made along the weight bearing area's with a large arch area that left no impression, the toes appeared to be small with all leaving the same type of impression.  This sighting occured in late December, around l0pm at night, and I feel that the year was l997 or l998. I also, a year or so before this sighting, being on the rear deck porch off our master bedroom, also later at night, hear a strange howling sound far off in the distance, sounding like it was near the top of the ridge some l/4 mile up the hill behind our house.

"The first incident for me happened in late winter 2003 around the end of February or early March. I had an exchange student living with me and my family and she had a snow day so we headed outside that day. Since she rarely gets to see snow I thought it would be a treat to walk around and play in the snow. I told her we would take a short walk into the pine grove behind us even though it is not our land, I figured it wouldn't hurt for her to take some pictures of the trees. As we were walking I was struck at the fact that I couldn't find her any animal tracks. I just figured it was new snow and the tracks had been covered up. As we walked I was really surprised how quiet it was. Again thinking the new snow had something to do with it. There are a lot of crows in the woods but that day they made no sound. As we walked we did come along some tracks. I asked her what did she think made those knowing what I was thinking; I wanted to hear what she had to say first. She said it looked exactly like some one was walking around barefoot. She asked me what kind of animal has footprints like a human. I thought about bear but have studied bear print pictures and these were very long and narrow. The fact that there were only two also eliminated the bear. There was no overlapping of prints. The space between them was really far as well. I am not tall but I didn't even come close to stretching my stride that far. We followed the footprints and they had stopped and looked as if they squatted down. Just the toes were showing which consisted of the five toes. We looked up and the tracks stopped just inside the woods looking towards the back of my husband’s shop. That kind of freaked us both out. The footprints started to turn and walk up the fence post in the direction they had come. My exchange student wanted to follow but I said no way. She even had a camera with her and we didn’t even think to get a picture. On Spring break in April of that same year my daughter and I decided to go hiking in the late afternoon, in our other neighbor’s woods across the street after getting permission. They have about 400 acres of woods and we had never been in it before. When we went in we were both surprised how rugged and diverse the landscape was. There was a swamp on the property as well as high cliffs. We had walked for a very long time trying to stay near the river. When I slipped down a very steep incline we both heard a very loud deep growling in the thick underbrush on the other side of the river. It was too dense for us to see what had made the scary noise and I told my daughter to run as I knew there was no way I was getting back up the hill with a bad knee. She came down anyways and we heard it growl again but this time farther away. We headed back home after that as it was getting late. Curiosity got the best of us and we headed back the next afternoon taking along our exchange student. As soon as we entered the woods we heard the growl. We couldn’t see it this time either. We kept walking for a long time but never heard it again. We went the next afternoon including my husband this time but we didn’t hear anything. There were only two things we saw strange that day; one was as we were cutting across a field headed for home several turkeys came running fast from the woods just ahead of us followed by a couple of deer. My husband said we must have spooked them and I said if that were the case why did they come our way and not head into the woods? The other thing that was odd was a medium size log was placed over the entrance to the path we had been taking on those earlier afternoons. I asked the neighbors if they had placed it there and they said no. The following evening at my home I had to let my dog out at 10pm before we went to be. I had turned on the smaller porch lights that didn’t illuminate the yard as well as a big street light we have. When I stepped out the door to get my dog that wouldn’t come in I smelled the worse B.O. smell I have ever smelled. I got my dog and something to the left of me caught my eye. It was some kind of creature near the corner of the house and it looked as if it were squatting down. I could see it had very long reddish hair and I really couldn’t fathom what it was. It never even looked my way just stood motionless. I ran to get everyone else to see it. When they came out they couldn’t believe what they smelled. It filled the entire yard and was very thick. No one else got to see this thing because it was gone. We also kept hearing something knock on a tree 3 times several evenings after that night of the smell. The following weekend I and my daughter plus two of her male friends went to check out the neighbors woods once again. We walked for sometime but saw nothing and headed back walking in a field next to the woods. I looked down and saw what appeared to be a large footprint that was human in appearance. I called the others and my daughter’s friend put his foot next to it. His shoe size was fifteen and this barefoot was much larger. We saw several that were walking on only two feet and had a very large stride, much larger than any of us could ever make. I remembered to use my camera that I had brought and I have a good picture of the print you could see it even more clearly in person then even the photo shows. I am reporting this because strange things have been going on for some time around here. I was just messing around with my spotlight scanning the fence row behind the house other night and a huge low growl happened again. I figured we were going to once again have a strange summer. My son told me a few years back that he and his friend had seen a very tall hairy creature salvaging in the back of my husband’s truck near the shop late one evening. He said he thought when it stood up that it appeared to be between 7 and 8 feet tall.

I was lost out in the woods while camping with my parents somewhere in central Ohio and this large female ape-like creature put me back in our camp. Then I started screaming and my parents who were out looking for me heard me and came back to the camp and found me.  I have not showed this picture to many people because they would have thought I was crazy.  I was a lawyer here in Summit County for nearly 40 years and I did not need any aspersions cast upon my sanity.  I have had two cancer surgeries in the past six months and I would now like to leave the original of this picture as a bequest in my will to the right kind of museum before anything else happens to me.  I also hope that this picture might corroborate the testimony of people with similar experiences whom nobody would believe before.

"I was out in the woods of Ashtabula County, Ohio in the Geneva area. I was picking up wood for a fire we were going to have at the neighbors house. I left my truck at the road, and walked into the woods to find some of the better wood and logs to use. I was coming out of the woods with some wood to put in the back of my truck, when a big hairy upright creature ran across the road and disappeared into the woods in four steps. I got in my truck and drove up there, turned my lights on where it went in to the woods, and I saw two yellow eyes glowing at me, and then they were gone.

"This is the second track find we have had since 1999. The first sighting I was contacted and I sent photos to a person who called on the phone. He was supposed to come and check it out, but never did. Okay, we have had more activity on our property and this time there are two three different sets of footprints, like a family so to speak. There is one that is very small like a young one. About two weeks ago, my mother told me to look at some footprints outside, I did not get a chance until today (May 26, 2002), the first thing we seen when going outside was our bird feeder had been bent all the way over, as to if something had pulled it down to get the birdseed. We have two of them almost side by side, the other one wasn't touched. We took the bird feeder and metal pole that it sat on inside the house. I then went back outside to look for the prints, I had found several prints ranging about seven to just over twelve inches. The toes seemed to be dug in more than the heels. What they did was follow a ravine up through our front yard, which is mud and sandstone. When it rains water goes down through there and we believe they must have been following the path down into the ravine below. The dogs bark constantly around here, and my toddler couldn't sleep one of those nights, he kept saying ""Rarrs"" which in toddler language at least his, means monster. He must have heard something outside his window, maybe a sound they make or something in that nature? The first time I submitted photos, they asked about seeing red eyes. My mother seen three sets of these eyes, and also heard the screaming, she was a born and raised country girl, so she knows what sounds are what in the country. She said she never heard anything like that in her life and made the hair on the back of her neck stand up. After hearing the sounds she quickly came in the house. She felt they were really close because of the loudness of the scream. Anyway, I hope someone can get out here quick, since we feel the bird feeder was destroyed by the track makers and they may destroy something else.

"Hello,I drive a delivery truck to Kansas 3 times a week.On the day of this sighting I had taken my 12 year old son with me on my route.As we turned onto Highway 10 from Highway 75 I told him to watch for deer on his side of the truck and I'd watch on mine. This road has had several deer killed from vehicles and I didn't want to hit one.As I drove we watched and seen no deer along the 6 miles stretch to Wann.As we rounded the curve on the east side of Wann it turns back into wheat fields, so we resumed watching for deer.As I started to watch on my side of the road I looked out across a winter wheat field (which is green this time of year)and noticed about 200-300 yards away a HUGE black figure bent over. I slowed the truck down to get a better look when my son turned to look at what I was looking at and he said,""Dad,is that a Bigfoot?""and about that time it stood upright and looked at the truck.I replied ""I think so.""I would have to say it was about 7-8 feet tall and about 300-500 pounds with jet black hair and a cone shaped head and very well proportioned. As we watched it for about 2 minutes it just stood there and watched us while it ate something it was picking off of a small branch it held in its right hand. (berries perhaps)The wierd thing about it it never ran or walked away.As we drove on it turned its whole body to watch us drive off not just its head.

"I was in the Love Valley Wildlife Management Area hunting feral hogs. I had been sitting on my stand for about two hours when I began to smell something akin to cat urine or skunk musk, and I thought that with the prevailing winds a large boar must have just crossed the ridge above me. So after a little while when the odor did not decrease I decided to see if I could circle around the top of the ridge and get a shot at the boar. I left my stand and moved about 60 yards down the base of the ridge (away from my hunting buddies who were in two different stands further down the base of the ridge) to a well used game trail and began my ascent. I got about halfway up the slope and something came flying through the air to my right and then after another step or two something came thought the air to my left this time by the sound of its landing and crashing through the brush, something much heavier than the first object. At this time I froze and began to scan the ridge line first with my eyes and then with my rifle scope, and I began to think that one of the guys I was hunting with was playing a prank on me. So I continued to climb the hill until a large piece of rock (it looked like a piece of ruined tombstone from the abandoned cemetery on the hill top but I am not sure) landed just at my feet and rolled down the hill with some force and momentum behind it. At almost that same moment I caught just the faintest glimmer of movement and from that was able to make out the shape of what looked like a huge man. I am 6' 2"" and 260 lbs but this thing was at least 9-10' tall and three or four times as broad as I am. I slowly brought my rifle and scope up to get a better look at it. Most of it was covered by brush and under growth but its head down to its upper chest were clearly visible. It had a shaggy coat (the breeze did a fair job of breaking up its silhouette) that was dark colored even with the aid of my scope all I could tell was that the beast was covered in fur and that it was of dark coloration. Its eyes seemed impossibly small for the size of its oblong head. I watched it with my scope for perhaps a minute or it could have been ten, I honestly could not tell you as I was not sure whether to be fascinated or terrified (from its size and mass I was not sure the 30-06 I had in my hands would be sufficient if I needed to be terrified). After a period of time I took one slow step back and then another after about my third slow step back down the hill the beast slowly turned as if to disregard me and my rifle and walked away in the other direction. After it was gone I found the piece of stone that had landed on the path in front of me and tumbled past and as I said before it could have been a piece of one of the crumbling tombstones from on top of the ridge or it could have been rock from some other source but I can tell you that I could not have thrown it at least not as far or with the same force as this rock had been thrown. I would estimate it to have weighed around 45-55 lbs.  After that I proceeded to go back down the base of the ridge to where both of my friends were still sitting in their stands one about 80 yards down from where I was set up and the other about 90 yards from the first.

"In 2002, in early fall (it was still nice outside) I was driving to work.  Ahead of me, on the crest of a hill, I saw a creature crossing the road.  It did not remind me of a monkey.  The legs and torso were too long.  It was on all fours at first; the limbs were substantial.  It was covered with dark brown longish hair.  It started across the road on all fours; the back limbs looked about the same length as the front limbs.  It was not great big and bulky; however it was of considerable size.  There was quite a bit of room between the stomach area and the ground.  Very tall in that way.  After a few steps, it stood up and took a couple of huge running steps, as if trying to hurry up.  Then it leaped up over about a 6'  embankment and a fence.

"We were walking down the road enjoying our summer vacation.  When one of us noticed that there was something walking in the pasture North of where we were standing.  It was close to 7 feet tall, had long white hair (at least a foot), was walking on two legs.  It stopped when it noticed us standing there watching it.  Actually we were almost too scared to run.  Anyway it acted like it was going to come our way so we took off for a little ways then stopped to look again.  Everyone knows that a fence with 6 strands of barbed wire is at least 5 feet tall right.  Well, it stepped over that like it wasn't there and kept on going to the East taking long strides and swinging its arms back and forth while it walked.  A few days later we were in the same general area and noticed some long white hair hooked on the top wire of the fence.  We took it home to prove our story we told the day before.  We called it a Honka.  Have to say that we were more careful about how late we stayed out from that day on.  Always made sure we were home before dark.

"Several of us old hippies meet once a year in October at Tishomingo, Ok to camp and enjoy each other.  This October (the first week-end) we met as usual at the Tishomingo state park.  There were 15 of us at the campsite on Saturday night.  It was around 9:30 pm when I was leaving the burning embers and people behind me to walk to my tent alone.  When I got about halfway to the tent, someone ran across in front of me in front (close to) the tent.  I knew all of the campers were at the site and most of them cannot run.  I don't drink or do drugs and so I stopped for a moment and thought about who it could have been.  My tent was facing the Blue River.  I stopped, turned around and decided to try to get back to all of the people.  When I reached them, I asked for someone to walk me back to the tent with a flashlight.  Two of my friends, males, made fun of the sighting I informed them about and told me it was probably a deer.  Deer run on four legs!  Then they told me it was probably one of the brown bears.  Brown bears can't run with the stride of a man and they aren't that tall (around 6' or more).  I got in my tent and loaded my gun and slept with it under my pillow (my hands making sure the steel was touching the gun all night long).

"It was dark, about 8pm. My two sons and I were watching television while eating popcorn. The eldest, age 16 was sitting accross the room, on the loveseat. The youngest, age 8 was sitting next to me on the sofa, we were sharing a bowl of popcorn placed between us. I smelled this horrific stench coming from the window directly behind us.(My family has teased me about having the nose of a hound)so the my 16 yr.old says ""Oh Mom your always smelling something."" Well, I look around and the smell dissipates,we continue watching television; a few minutes pass, and the stench blows in again. I got up while telling my oldest son to help me pull out the sofa that there is something horrible under it.As he appooached he smells the stench and says""It'ts a snake"", the youngest moved back, we pulled the couch out and looked all over the entire room and came up with nothing.We notice the breeze blowing the curtain and deside that whatever the source it's outside, and we'll check it out in daylight. The 16 yr old went outside about an hour later. He came back inside for the shotgun.(His Dad has taken him hunting since he was 6 years old, he knows guns and the woods.)He said someone was standing in back, about 6 yards (north )of the house by a railroad tie post, watching the house, and it was one darn big guy. He took the gun and went toward our chicken pen. I heard him yell from about 50 yards or so from our chicken pen to ""call the law."" I was scared beyond measure for my son not knowing what was happening. I called the sheriff, after about 10 min. my son came back to the house he said the guy stepped over a bobbed wire fence, and jumped over a brush pile while leaving. He'd not had to use the gun. Two sheriff deputies arrived.They shined lights up and down the yard and property and found nothing. My son went to his Grandmothers house to inform her that we had a prowler. She lived about 40 yards northeast of us.He'd been gone about 20 min.when I heard the metal latch of an outside storage building.Someone had gone into the building.Now my youngest son and I were in the house, the eldest knowing I was already spooked would not be lurking about. His Dad was out of town working putting up a gas rig. The question being who had opened the latch?The building is my laundry room and contained my washer, dryer, and deepfreeze. I phoned my mother-in-law, and asked to speak to my son. When he answered the phone I asked if he'd been there the whole time. The answer being yes, I told him someone had entered the laundry building, and to my knowledge hadn't left.He said he would be home after telling him to be careful, I waiting and watched. He was home in two minutes. While we were discussing what to do he yelled what in the **** is that? My 8 yr.old ran into the kitchen, they both had seen a face in the picture window behind the sofa.The eldest said it was hairy and dirty. I called the sheriff again, my son got the shotgun, my youngest son and myself waited behind him sitting on the floor with the lights out. I fully expected some deranged vagabond to jump through the window.While waiting we smelled the stench again as we were only 3 or 4 ft. from the window.Then I knew the scent was coming from this person.Knowing this sent chills up my spine. The deputies arrived and again found nothing, and left.I never associated this event with the bigfoot until reading about other icidents.The stench is what ties it in for me, and the discription my son gave of the face in the window, the way this character acted just wasn't in keeping with anything I've ever known. But the deciding factor for me was about 8 months ago I repeated this story to a friend of ours, retired Oklahoma Highway Patrolman, who hunts with my husband.He said this was out of character for any perp he'd ever seen.As close as I can describe it the scent was a mix between dirty,wet,steamy blue jeans,soiled diapers,and wet, filthy dog.

"Having had the benefit of finding a footprint when I was 13, my interest in bigfoot has led me to privately research the subject for many years. Thanks to your website I have been able to concentrate much of my attention on Oklahoma, since it has many more reports than my native Kansas, which has not been updated. On that note, myself and some other interested participants traveled to Leflore County in SE Oklahoma in an attempt to find some evidence, since this area is a hotspot of reported activity. Traveling to Honobia, we met a few of the inhabitants who were more than willing to provide us with information and possible locations where we might have some type of encounter. Please note that this is near the exact location that the Mysterious Encounters team filmed the Oklahoma Wildman episode. We too visited the house where they set up operations and noted how the previous occupants had left so abruptly that most of their possessions remained in the home, including a refrigerator full of spoiled food. Having set up camp we proceeded to stay up until near dawn, occasionally playing the Sierra bigfoot vocalizations, and patroling the area. Nothing was seen or heard throughout the night. The following day, while walking through the area, myself and one other located three full footprints and one potential track on a road leading up the hillside toward the top of the hill. While we did not apply plaster-of -paris to the tracks or accurately measure them, we did take photos. Using dollar bills as gauges to measure the length not only of the footprint, but also the stride between tracks, I would quite accurately estimate that the prints themselves were over sixteen inches long and the stride nearly five and a half feet. These tracks were located on a sloping road traveling upwards at nearly 40 degrees. Also of note: I understand that many people will disregard such tracks as those of bears or other large animals, but we also took photos of bear tracks we found near the Little River located nearby. Anyone who has any idea of what animal tracks look like can tell the difference. They are not even close. These tracks were huge.",Just off of State Highway 144 one mile east of Honobia.

"On April the 17th 2004 I was Turkey hunting in the Ouachita National Forest with my girl friend and my brother. I had crossed the creek that ran along side an old log road that headed up the mountain to the west, when I decided to hunt the creek bottom that afternoon. As I set up my Turkey blind and got settled in to do some hunting I blew one of my locater calls it was a screaming hawk. After sitting there for about 15 minutes I turned my head and noticed a burnt looking tree about 50 yards to my left. I raised my shotgun and looked at it with my scope when I realized what I was seeing was not a tree but a large creature like I have never seen before, it stood about eight feet tall, had charcoal dark color hair covering its entire body. [The hair] was about three inches long and coarse in appearance. It was watching me as well as I was watching it. Its eyes were reddish-brown in color, it had long arms and walked up right never taking its eyes off me, and I never took my eyes off of it. This thing was just looking at me as if it had been watching me for some time. This thing scared me pretty bad if you can give me a call I will give you more details.

We set up camp in the Billy Creek campground.  At approximately 2330 hours Ann and I both heard an unusual sound.  Ann described the sound as being a cross between an elk and an elephant.  She heard the sound twice and thought it came from west of us on a slight ridge.  I heard the sound four times and thought it came from the creek bottom.  I would describe the sound as having a hollow quality with two distinct pitches.  The sound lasted about three seconds with the first half being the higher pitch.  Our dog was acting rather nervous for a short time before and during the sounds.  After the sounds he settled down and went to sleep.  We didn't hear anything else.

"I was reading some of your sighting reports of other people who have had an encounter with one of these creatures. I also have seen one back in 1986 in Bowie County, Texas while deer hunting with my Nephew late one November afternoon. Since that time I live in LeFlore County, Oklahoma.Last Spring while Turkey Hunting with my brother at Big Cedar,OK he had an encounter with one that was about 8'-9' tall this thing shook him up pretty bad. I got a call from a guy at Big Cedar Thursday Jan. 26th last week saying a Road Crew that was working on a bridge on highway 63 East of Big Cedar had found some large tracks of some kind of man or Something. My Nephew and I went there yesterday and seen the tracks they look real my nephew took some pictures, and I contacted Jerry Heston and told him about this. The last two or three years there has been a number of sightings around this area. Myself being an avid hunter and outdoorsman I have desided to hunt for one of these creatures, not to shoot or kill one, but to prove they do exist. If I can be of any help please let me know. Alot of the people that are doing research on these things are good people, but some of them don't know the first thing about the outdoors or this creature.

"Me and a long time friend were camping in the woods near Heavener, Okla by Tram Ridge Road.  About 5:15pm we heard what sounded like an ape at the zoo. We sat and listened to this for about two minutes and then there were knocks coming from the area of the creek below us. We thought it was a woodpecker at first but the knocks were to slow and too loud for it to be that. We had read where that is the way they communicate so we decided to try for ourselves. I really don't think this was a good thing. When started to bang two logs together. The knocks got closer to us and we heard more knocks start so we stopped. About one to two minutes after that some rocks came flying into camp and these were not small stones that you could throw a long ways. These were about 4 to 5 inches in diameter. As soon as it stopped we were on guard for the rest of the day and that night just got worse. We went to bed about 10:30pm and all sounded good until there were walking sounds outside our tent and the sounds of what we thought was something smelling along the seam of the tent and around the windows of the tent.

"We started a trip into the Horse thief Springs Trail from Cedar Lake on Saturday afternoon at 1730. We had a late start due to drive from Texas and waking up two teenagers on a Saturday.  We were in a hurry to make the springs before dark, so we pressed pretty hard on the trail...we had 7 miles to cover quickly. We had planned on hiking The Old Military Road Trail several miles to the west, but audibled to this one due to available water sources.  I made camp on the other side of the Ouachita National Recreation Trail where it intersects with the shorter HST...this was about 200 yards past where a small water flow crosses the ONRT.  About 2100, my son's friend stated, ""What was that?""  My son looked at me and asked if I heard the noise.  I wasn't paying attention because I was making our dinner.  Another call immediately came...it was a series (3-4) of high-pitched whoops.  They were very clear and distinct.  My best guess would be within 1/2 mile to our north. At one point my son said, ""It sounds like a monkey!"" This continued for a while and eventually we heard the ""whoops"" start coming from our south.  The ones from the south sounded like they were coming from past Hwy 1 because we could hear an occasional car pass and it sounded much closer.  The calls seemed to go on into the night intermittently.  I finally fell asleep around 0230 in the morning and was up around 0600.

"We were on our way to a rental cabin (Cloud 9 cabins), in Smithville Oklahoma on Oct 1, 2009 on Beechton Road (dirt road) at about 4:30pm. The weather conditions were overcast, temp around 60, no rain, daylight, we were driving about 30 mph. No cars, houses, people for miles around. As we were heading to the west from Mena, Ak about a 1 ½ miles or so from the turnoff to the cabins, my wife Debbie smelled something sweet but dead smelling at the same time. About a minute after that, we went around a turn in the road, and saw an animal move across the road from the left to the right, into the brush and trees.  This animal moved in a very fluid motion on all fours. It was dark grey or black, short hair, about 36” long and about 24” high. It had no tail, no collar on its neck. The head was completely round about the size of a large grapefruit. There were also no ears or snout visible. It ran by moving its legs back and forth, not together as in how a cat would run fast. We could not identify it. We thought we might have seen a baby Sasquatch, going to its mother in the woods. We felt the mother might have crossed first, before we came to the curve. We do know what it was not. It was not a dog, cat, bear, bobcat, skunk, wolverine, rat, rabbit, skunk, or anything else that we have ever seen, and we do spend a lot of time in the woods, hunting and camping. The total time we saw the animal was about 3 seconds, and we stopped to look were it had entered into the woods, but saw nothing. What was more striking in my mind was, if it were to stand up. It would have looked like a small dark person. (keep in mind we didn’t see the face) We still think to this day that is/was a baby Sasquatch. When we got back home in Missouri, we looked on the internet for baby gorillas, to compare what they looked like to this animal, and there was a close match.",,Le Flore County,Oklahoma,Fall,Report 26711: Couple witness a possible juvenile running on all fours in Smithville,34.49108,-94.49968,10/1/2009,26711,Class B,9yhu1wgmjg,79.04,62.575,46.11,63.79,0.88,0.6,0.41,0.0047,0.82,rain,1009.64,Rain in the evening.,4,8.62,233,2.49
"My wife and I were in Broken Bow, OK on Sun. the 18th of March 2012. We live in Arkansas about 20 miles west, but on a whim decided to take a 2 hr detour north on HWY 259 and cut across Rich Mt. Rich Mt is the highest point in the Ouachita Mts. I had commented about how squatchy the area looked and my wife replied that we would not see one in the day time. Well, about 45 minutes later she saw one. We were about a mile south of Talimena Scenic By-Way on 259, right on the west end of Rich Mt. She said it was about 35-40 ft off the road walking behind a tree. She described it as being 9-10 ft tall with stringy hair of varying shades of brown. She noticed it was bipedal with long arms swinging in the usual 'squatchy' way. She was very firm when I asked if perhaps it was a bear and said that she knew what she saw. As my luck goes, we were at a point where the road was hairpin curves with no shoulders and no way to turn around. I guess I'll have to wait for my first sighting.

"We went to LeFlore County to trail ride and during the trip there my husband and I joked about the possibility of seeing one. I even went to Honobia, OK with my daughter to the Bigfoot Festival in 2011 and learned a great deal.  I also want to say that I have nothing to gain by fabricating a tall tale about Bigfoot.  I have hesitated about reporting this encounter because my best friend of 40 years doesn’t believe me.  But I assure you, this really happened.  I am so excited about the encounter that we are returning to the area with our horses in a few weeks to do some investigating of our own and to trail ride some more since it rained on us all weekend this last time. We went to the Cedar Lake, Ouachita National Forest in OK.  The forecast called for rain most of the weekend but we had high hopes of doing a lot of trail riding on our horses.  My parents pulled their RV and we hauled my Dad’s horse along with ours in our stock trailer. And our camp sites were on the edge of the campgrounds, right next to the forest.  Saturday morning we went trail riding, and kept noticing a strange smell. (no one else from the camp was riding at this time, the 3 of us were alone in the woods) Smelled like musky skunk.  And a few times our horses refused to travel up certain trails. After some encouragement they finally went on.  Later that evening about 7:00pm my husband and I went to feed the horses at the camp site where our trailer was parked and saw a herd of deer passing through our camp site.  They stepped just inside the tree line and stopped.  We watched them for about 2-3 minutes then they ran off.  I took some hay down to the woods and put it on the trail hoping they would come back.  That’s when I noticed the skeletal remains of what I thought may have been a deer.  After that, my husband and I went for a walk in the woods to gather firewood before it got too dark. We didn’t get very far when my husband asked me if I had seen that? I said, see what?  He said that he saw something big and black dart across and down a hill. I told him that I didn’t see anything cause I was looking at the ground for firewood.  He was feeling very uneasy and was ready to get out of the woods so we went back to camp with a few sticks of firewood.  When we returned to camp, I was feeling kind of ornery, and decided to play upon my husbands “uneasiness”.  I took a branch and went inside the tree line and made some “wood knocks”.  It was getting dark so we got a small fire going in the fire pit.   And we were all sitting in front of the RV and talking, when we started hearing coon dogs baying as though they treed a coon.  (Could have been coyotes, I have never heard coyotes sound quite like this though.)  So I’m thinking, “Great! We have to listen to the coon hunters all night”.  My momma said that she heard a faint blood curdling scream/moan while those dogs were howling. So we made a few more wood knocks and the dog howling stopped and we never heard it again. Then shortly after that, we heard something walking in the woods, twigs breaking and leaves rustling.  We thought it was deer so we went on about our business telling ghost stories and bigfoot stories when all of a sudden  the trees in front of us started shaking violently! It sounded like something very big was coming thru the forest towards us!  Like a dinosaur movie where you see the forest moving and hear breaking of branches long before the dinosaur jumps out.  It was like that only we were not at the movies!  This was real!  We were all frozen in our lawn chairs! No one could move! We kept waiting for whatever it was to jump out at us! We could hear branches cracking, crunching and rattling and I saw the tops of the trees shaking in a circular motion.  Then it stopped.  And the forest was silent. We had a spot light and we thought about shining it in the trees but we were all to frightened!  My husband doused the fire and we all went inside the RV shortly after that.  The next morning we walked down to the trees that were shaking to look for footprints. (about 20-30’ downhill) We didn’t see anything for all the ground clutter, leaves and pine cones, twigs and pine needles.  I looked at the two trees that were shaking and they were fairly close together, I’d say about 10-12” apart at the base, they were 30’-40’ tall and about 12”-18” diameter.   We also looked for fallen limbs and branches and there was nothing on the ground that wasn’t already there. I’m HOOKED!

"I had just got off work approximately 60 miles away and had been driving home. I saw something (I'm not saying it was a bigfoot,) large bending over (its back facing me). It looked like it was picking something up off the highway that runs over the bridge. It was pretty different than I had imagined they looked like, though. It was really tall, even bending over the way it was. It had long, straight brown hair, though, like a dog or something. I always pictured them to have black hair, but this was brown. There were things hanging in the hair, little sticks and undergrowth looking stuff, and it was really dirty. The only other thing I really remember is the smell as I drove by, it was awful! I was driving my convertible with the top down, and the smell of what ever that was - well, I can't even describe how bad it was. That's really all I saw, etc. I was driving about 60 mph and after I saw whatever that was, I sort of got the creeps and sped home and ran in to tell my husband what happened. I didn't even put the top back up on the convertible. The bridge that I saw whatever that was on is only about a quarter of a mile from my house. So, needless to say, I'm not real happy about coming home from work after dark anymore. Also, I know this sounds weird, but about a week and 1/2 before the sighting, we kept hearing the strangest scream (that's the best way to describe the noise,) and it was not one of our calves or any of our livestock, and after about 2 days of hearing this noise, it finally stopped. The next day, we found a little baby goat with the umbilical cord still attached and dragging the ground all alone - no mother goat to be found anywhere. We found him all alone in the wooded area back behind our house. When we found him, he was terrified, he didn't make a noise or anything - it took us hours to catch him. He finally bleats (cries) now, and it sounds nothing like the noise we heard before we found him. We have also lost 4 baby kittens in the last month, they seem to have just disappeared.

"My wife, daughter, son, and I were fishing at a lake near Guthrie Oklahoma.  It was the end of May and we decided to do some night fishing but arrived well before dark.  We got our poles in the water and were enjoying being outdoors when some doves started calling back and forth.  Our daughter began imitating the calls and did a fairly good job of it. As it began to get dark, I attempted to light my old Coleman lantern but couldn't get it to generate so we packed up and moved over closer to the boat ramp where there was some light from a street lamp.  Once it was dark, the noise from the frogs and insects was loud enough for us to comment about.  A couple of owls also began hooting back and forth and our daughter began imitating them too. This went on for some time until one of the owls flew right in front of us - close enough to see it in what little light we had.  Almost as soon as the owl was past there was in incredible roar from the direction the owl came from. It was so loud and forceful that I felt it vibrate in my chest.  It lasted about 5 seconds and then it became dead silent.  No frogs, no bugs, nothing except my wife and daughter looking at me and asking, What the hell was that? It took a bit but the frogs and bugs slowly began their chorus again. I spent 21 years in the military and never in my travels heard anything like this. What ever made this noise had to be huge and it sounded angry.  I spent time in Central America and have heard Howler monkeys at close range. They are loud but never did one rattle my chest. We stayed a few minutes longer and then packed up and went home.  I've spent a lot of time outdoors in various parts of the world and have very seldom felt uneasy - this rattled me a bit.

"I was walking with my dog down a dirt road near my grandparents house. It was about 8pm and still light out. We were about 1/2 mile down the road when my dog started barking and going crazy. She would just stand between my legs and growl and bark, this is a big dog, a German Shepard. Finally I got her to calm down. I heard some grunting and moving around in the woods to our right, I figured it was a deer or wild hog. As I moved closer, I saw it raise up from behind a fallen tree. I'd say it was roughly 7' tall. I would guess it was 300-400 lbs, kinda reddish brown hair covering its body. Its face looked like a monkey in a way. I couldn't move, my dog was going crazy trying to stay between me and what ever it was. It was only there for a flash. I know it turned and ran off and my dog gave chase to it, and I turned and ran home. About 30-45 minutes later, my dog came home, panting, but unhurt.

"In November 1996 just a couple of days before thanksgiving my best friend and I were camping and deer hunting on Weyerhaeuser forestry land in SE Oklahoma the nearest town would be Smithville but even at that it would somewhere around 9 miles as the crow flies. (Land has since been sold to John Hancock Corp). This area is in the same general area as where my written report occurred. This area is used to grow soft pine trees for harvesting to grind into paper pulp. The total area is something around 800,000 acres. So you can imagine how big of an area this is. There are no homes or anyone living in this area at all, in fact you are not even allowed to build any permanent hunting cabins or such things. By this time of 1996 I had actually all but given up gun deer season, I was almost strictly a bow hunter. About 3 years before I was actually in a tree stand and had a bullet go over my head. Some idiot was out there somewhere (never seen him heard the shot but never seen the guy that pulled the trigger) anyway he was out there just taking pot shots. I had decided after that I would just stay with my bow hunting. However my buddy wanted me to go with him as he was alone, so I decided to go ahead and accompany him. The area that we camped in is an area that is very difficult to get to and rarely does anyone go into this area. You have to exit off a logging road and travel up this very steep clear cut that climbs up a small mountain. There is really not even a road as such that you have to travel along. At one time the loggers just took a dozer and cut a path the width of the dozer from the bottom of the mountain all the way up and then along the crest of the mountain. And this path is never maintained so it gets very rough and only a 4x4 can get through and even with that you have to drive at a speed little more than walking speed. This path travels about 3 miles and simply dead ends just at the start of the downward side of the mountain. Me and my buddy call it the dish. We call it that because you are traveling up this mountain in heavy forest make a curve then suddenly you are facing down and at the bottom is a area that very much resembles a satellite dish where it is void of trees and the concave shape of the ground gives the impression of a satellite dish. This clear area is about 30 feet or so in diameter. So anyway we make the journey up the mountain and take the treacherous path up to the dish. There we make our camp and it of course becomes our home away from home for the next few days. It was a bit odd this year because normally you see one or two hunting camps once you enter the area from the highway. But this time we seen not one camp or hunter. Now to take note the dish from the highway is 14 miles, now of course that is not straight line miles because you know how access and logging roads rarely run straight for any distance. On day 3 of our hunting trip we get up before daylight as usual and get ready to go out into nature and see if we find any deer. After all, that was why were there, even so I had seen nothing the previous two days but didn’t really care because as usual I very much was enjoying myself with the flora and fauna. I am also very interested in geology and there is much to see in that area. To imagine that area at one time was a shallow sea never ceases to amaze me. I wish when I took my first geology course in college I would have changed my major and pursued that field further. Oh sorry there got off track didn’t I. We decide which directions we were going and we plan for our rendezvous back at the dish for 12 noon. We walk together for about ½ mile camp and there we split up my buddy continues to the west along the top of the mountain and I head south down the side of the mountain. Being that it was not yet daylight and these woods are very thick and dangerous to walk in during the daylight hours due to the rough rocky terrain I was not about to do any walking until first light so after we split I only walked about 10 yards or so and sat down and waited for a few more minutes until sun up. At sun up I get up and start my hunt, I normally am not a stalker for a couple of reasons to be a successful stalker you must have coordination to walk and not make noise also you really need a lot of stamina. I possess neither of those traits. So I normally hunt from some type of stand. But I had sat for several hours the evening before and was ready to move, plus I wanted to do some exploring into a saddle I had never been into before so this day I decided to stalk. NOTE: I am using the term “saddle” here and will continue using that term; however it really is not a saddle as such. A saddle is the gap between where 2 mountains run close together. This area is on the same mountain but it has two ridges (or fingers extending out away from the mountain) making a gap and valley in between these two parallel fingers much like a saddle. Imagine if you will, make a fist with your left hand, then after you make a fist extend your index and middle finger out like you are making the peace sign. Your hand is the mountain and your two extended fingers are these fingers that extend out from the mountain. The width of this finger is I am guessing somewhere around 150 yards, but could not see all the way through because of the trees (more on this further below). I will be walking down that eastern finger which in the above example would be your middle finger. Your index finger will be the western finger or ridge. (I hate using the term ridge it is too vague). The distance between these two fingers were only about 50 yards apart at the mountain and by the time you get out to the tips they are nearly a hundred yards apart. So the technically are not parallel either they do diverge some. And the length of the finger I am on is about 300 yards. The length of the western finger is about 370 yards. Never went up there so I have no clue how wide across it is. Also the crest of that finger is about 20 – 30 yards higher than the one I am on. END OF NOTE I start walking down the mountain side and after about a half hour I reach the eastern finger of the saddle. I sit for a few minutes to rest and catch my breath before taking out down this finger of the saddle. On this finger I could view the saddle valley to my right and also could see the eastern side of the western finger of the saddle. From the top of the finger I was walking I could see very clearly down to the bottom of the saddle which was no more than 100 feet to the floor nearest the mountain and as you walked the top of the finger away from the mountain this finger sloped downward toward the valley so that by the time the finger ended the valley within the saddle was no more than 50 feet from the peak of the finger to the valley within the saddle. So from my 12 o’clock position to 180 degrees to my right (clockwise) I had a totally unobstructed view. With the exception of the trees in the saddle valley. But I had a clear enough view that if a deer was in there or came through that valley there was no way I would miss seeing it. This particular course also gave me a good look at the western finger face although with many trees on it there were several spot that had no trees and the rock strata was exposed which would give me a chance to look at to see If I could distinguish the types of rock there. I could also watch the ridge top of the western finger and see anything coming over the top. Over to my right across the top of this finger is heavily wooded with mainly hardwoods however there were some pine trees among them. This is old growth trees some of the hardwood (oaks, hickory) are quite large. It is heavily wooded enough that even in the bright sun it is fairly dark in there only a few feet in. Not dark enough that you can’t see but you certainly would not need sun glasses in there. It, just like up in the dish it gets dark in there long before the sun is fully set. There is very little under growth in this area because it is so sunlight challenged. And the spacing between trees are fairly wide so that if anything of any size moved through you would have no trouble sighting it. This tree line extends almost all the way to the edge of the finger. You would only have maybe 5 feet of space to walk the length of the finger clear of trees. From the edge of this finger I am on in some places are straight down into the valley below. The only way to get on this finger is from the direction I came or as I will speak to later would be from the very end or tip of this finger. So I slowly stalk down this finger, keeping just inside the tree line so as not to be exposed to the valley floor and the western finger. I stalk very slowly along in no hurry whatsoever. Understanding that stalking means walk a few steps stop, wait, and listen, and repeat. I stalk nearly the entire length of this finger and decide I need a break so I walk out of the tree line to a spot that is actually clear of trees (except for one tree about the diameter of basketball) for about an area the size of a large bedroom. There was this very fine looking stump there that actually looked like it was made for my fat butt and it was high enough that I did not even have to bend my knees very far to be sitting. I figured I would sit for a while and rest my tired legs then I would finish walking this finger all the way to the tip and look down it and into the valley across the way. Then head back because we were to hook back up at noon and by now it was 9:30 and I was a good 3 miles from camp and a very hard climb back up the mountain. (Why in the hell did I ever decide to walk down the damn mountain, I knew I would have to walk back up at some point)? As I was sitting on my fine stump I looked down the finger out to the tip. At the tip was a huge oak tree I am 5ft 10 and it would have took two of me to wrap my arms around this thing. As I was looking at this tree and trying to figure out how a tree can grow to that size in so little soil. I then notice just off to the right of this tree a figure walking up from below the tip of the finger. The figure was in bright sunlight so I immediately recognized it as walking on two feet. And he appeared to me to be walking with his head down. But my first thought was what a dumb ass. It is deer season and if you are in hunting you are required to wear blaze orange and this guy had none. Even if you are not hunting it is a good idea if you’re out in the woods. Now granted I had only seen one human in 3 days and that was my hunting buddy. And even though there were no humans for miles I for one would never take a stupid chance like that. I guess I should mention also that during the deer gun season, logging operations cease and the loggers go home. The company’s do not want their employees getting plugged by some knucklehead hunter. So I knew that this guy was not a logger. Then the next question came to my mine how in the hell did this guy get there? There is no logging road in that direction for a very long way. And from the nearest road it is a long ass haul to that point. And that haul would not be easy at all in fact that area is inaccessible even by an ATV. The next thought no he is not a hunter he is not carrying a rifle nor does he have one slung on his shoulders. Now remember that all these thoughts were processed in my head in a matter of micro-seconds. While this guy was walking slowly up this slope to the top of this finger that I am on. Then the next though through my mind gosh that is a cone head (from the movie) with hair. Because his head was very pointy. Next thought my god those are big assed shoulders. Next thought why in the hell is he wearing a mink coat? WTF. Next thought did god forget to give this guy a neck? It looked to me as his head was attached directly to his shoulders. Then this guy finally reaches the top and stands directly besides that big oak I was looking at just moments ago. Next thought my god that is one big MF. I have seen many football games and some of those have been up in the nose bleed section and those guys even that high up look big. But this was different I am now 83 yards from this guy and he is the biggest person I have ever seen bar none. Then the big guy looks up and looks directly at me out in front of god and everyone. It was then I realized ok I am not looking at any man but not really animal either it didn’t seem. Now let me attempt to explain what big guy did. Imagine yourself standing looking straight ahead at some target and right next to you and slightly in front of you to your right is a big tree. Your desire now is to get behind that tree with little movement as possible. What you would most likely do is simply lift your left foot and pivot 90 degrees counterclockwise on your right foot with your head and neck froze in place to watch your target while moving. That is what he done. Next thought do I have any clean underwear back at camp cause me thinks I need them. Then the flight or fight response kicked in on me but I forced myself to stop think and evaluate. I determined that at 83 yards (didn’t know it was exactly 83 yards at that time I went and marked off the distance later)(I was actually guessing at the time 100 yards)there was no way no matter how fast he was, that he could cover that distance before I put at least 3 bullets in him. (However I thought later than may have only pissed him off as big as he was). But anyway when I assured myself there was no real danger I calmed down and started thinking clearly again. The big guy was now standing behind that oak watching me then suddenly he popped behind the tree and I couldn’t see him. So at that point I very slowly got up and moved behind that little tree near me. Then I peeked around that basketball sized tree (BTW at that time I was beach ball size so you can see the tree really offered no concealment) to see what was happing. By the time I looked back up he was once again peeking out from behind the tree. Now this time I thought that poor guy is deformed somehow because there appeared to be some kind of growth just around and below his throat. Could not make it out but definitely could see the discoloration and could see that there was something there that didn’t belong. I was straining as hard as I could to make out the facial figures of this guy but try as I might there was simply no way I could make out any details of his face. My one real regret in this whole experience. Anyway we just kind of stared at each other for a couple of seconds then he popped back behind the tree. So I done the same the best I could. Here I am in an area with trees the size of Volkswagens and leave to me to pick a sapling to hide behind. After a couple of seconds behind the tree I pop out my head don’t see him but I stay in that position a couple of more seconds then the big guy pops out his head again and looks at me. Now I am really confused because the growth that seemed to be on his throat is now over on top of where a clavicle would be. I don’t know what is going on it is just too far away for me to make out fine detail. Someone with better vision probably would have been able to make things out better. Now here it becomes surreal and I don’t know if I can put into words the way the situation seemed to instantly change. One moment I am so tense you could not have driven a straight pin up my butt with a 16 lb sledge hammer. The very next second a calm came over me and somehow I just had a feeling that there was nothing to be concerned about. So while he was looking at me I purposely leaned my rifle up against the stump I was just sitting at with him watching me. I just got the distinct feeling (yes I know the least scientific thing in the world) that he knew that I meant no harm and had no intention of doing anything to him. Maybe not maybe I am just reading more into that than I should. For lack of a better word we basically played peek-boo for another two minutes popping back and forth behind the trees. I just got a feeling he would have liked to have gotten a closer look at me just like I wanted to with him. Of course that was never going to happen. I think we may have kept doing that for a while longer but something happened that changed the circumstance. After a total of just about 3 minutes he very suddenly snaps around the other direction? I was thinking what the heck. Then I heard what he heard very large SNAP coming from the woods on top of this finger. I peed. Then the big guy turns and keeping the tree between me and him he simply walks off. He did not run or even walk particularly fast, he was walking a bit faster leaving than he did walking in but not in any panic. I figured if it was something that made him want to leave the area I better figure out quick what that made that noise. So I pick up my rifle and immediately start scanning. I want so badly to walk over to the tip to see if I can a glimpse of big guy. But I don’t dare until I resolve this issue. After a couple of minutes of searching and listening to the noise I finally track to the source of the noise maker. A frigging tank rat. Damn I missed a possible chance to get a better look at big guy because of a dang tank rat. (Don’t bother looking that species up that is my personal term for an armadillo). As stated above after the incident I walked off the distance and also solved one of the mysteries. The abnormal growth on big guy was not on big guy at all. It was on the tree it was a viral knot about the size of softball. I am 5’ 9/10, standing under the knot I could barely touch the bottom edge of the knot with my fingers standing on my tip toes and arm extended as far as I could. I found no tracks what so ever even though I knew the exact location of where he walked up and back from, but the ground was hard pan and even a D9 bull dozer would have been hard pressed to leave any marks/tracks in that ground.",Can show on a topo map,McCurtain County,Oklahoma,Fall,"Report 25703: Experienced hunter decribes a brief standoff at approx. 80 yards, in daylight, near Smithville",34.36778,-94.68028,3/25/2009,25703,Class A,9yhet2ryvd,64.62,54.225,43.83,43.16,0.79,0.31,0.96,0.0147,1,rain,1012.01,Rain in the evening.,8,8.04,103,0.95
I was with a friend of mine behind his grandmas house. We had seen some dead fish near a pond broke in half so we went back later that day to look to see what might have caused it. We went about 100 yards in the woods when my friend had to go use the bathroom so he walked away from me when I heard a noise off to the right. I looked and see something looking around a tree about 50 to 75 yards away. I could make out fur on the outline of the shape it looked like it was about 8 feet tall.

"This is a story I have been reluctant to even think about.  One night me and three other friends were in a storage shed located on the back of my friends property fetching things we needed.  We decided to head back to the house after we got what we came for and I was left behind attempting to latch the door because it was very old and hard to get it to fasten properly.  My three buddys had walked off at this time leaving me headed towards the house.  I was walking the exact same path they were taking actually more of a faster trot when I heard a noise like disturbed leaves to the left of me.  Curiously startled I stopped and looked in the direction of the noise and there it was.  Now at this location it happens to be at the back of the house and there is a chain link fence and about fifteen feet seperating me and this creature.

I didn't notice how dense the hair on the body of this creature was so it could of added to the size of what I saw.  I didn't mention this but there was only moonlight for me to see this by. Also this things abdomen was also tremendous and in a well defined v shape atop curvy big legs.  I have read some of the other reports and alot noticed a pungent odor but I did not and I believe that there was only fifteen feet at the most between me and this creature.

"I drove up Mill Creek Road to Tiger Creek Road (also called Tiger Canyon Road) and stopped at Skyline Campground (formerly squaw springs campground). I live in western Washington but grew up in Walla Walla and love the Blue Mountains. I’m an avid hiker and love to enjoy the outdoors. When I get the time I like to make a hiking trip. I hadn’t been to this particular site before but I had heard some of the Sasquatch stories coming out of the Tiger Canyon area. I had driven up Tiger Canyon a couple times before, including a few weeks prior in late June when the road was still blocked by snow. I thought this campground would be the perfect place to stay the night and hike the area. A friend of mine had been with on the trip when the road was blocked, but he too was busy this week so I went alone to scout out the area alone, stay the night and drive back to western Washington the next day. I had first been intrigued by the idea of Sasquatch when I found some info online while searching for hiking sites. As a kid some local friends had told me stories, but I’d never been sure what to make of it. I also had read a book about Blue Mountain Bigfoot that Vance Orchard had wrote. I wasn’t totally convinced that these creatures existed and did not think I would find anything about them because I figured that if there were encounters, they were very rare. I arrived at the campground at about one o’clock. An older couple was there reading, enjoying the campground. I picked an area and began set up my tent. As I was pounding the stakes in I felt something hit the ground behind me. I turned around and I didn’t see anything. I looked over at the couple and they were still sitting at their campsite. Whatever it was had caused a very strong vibration in the ground behind me and it couldn’t have been anyone at the camp. A little bit later I started to hear a weird noise. At first I thought it was the antifreeze bubbling in my car because it was a hot day and my car was steaming a little. My car overheats a lot. The sounds were like a low rumbling growl. It was a sustained sound that lasted for just a couple seconds. However I seemed to hear it in regular intervals. The sound also seemed to kind of echo like the sound of something hollow or the sound of water down a drain which is why at the time I thought it was my car. I decided to explore the area; I walked by the two other campers and said hi. They had a poodle that barked at me little. I wanted to see if I could look over Tiger Canyon at the valley from where we were so I crossed over to the other side if Kendall Skyline Road. I couldn’t see much through all the trees so I decided to head the other way. I brought a GPS device with me that had topography maps loaded on it. It showed a trail into the Wenaha-Tucannon Wilderness that I wanted to follow. As I started in that direction I noticed a very large track just to the right of a pool of water in some soft mud. It didn’t really look to me as something authentically Bigfoot because the foot seemed thin. I told myself it couldn’t be a footprint of a Sasquatch because I had read some stories a few weeks earlier and thought I could just be imagining it. I came back and looked around the area behind the camp where I had felt the thump. I had heard something knocking on a tree so I tried to make noise like I had done when I was hammering the tent posts. I had a little pattern of sorts that I thumped onto the ground with a rock. It seemed like at one point whatever it was mimicked the pattern of my thumps. I explored the area I thought it was coming from, but only saw a deer, so I figured maybe it was just my imagination getting the best of me. The noises stopped and I felt relieved. “It was all just in my head” I thought. It was now somewhere between 1:30 pm and 2 pm, and I started down towards Squaw Spring. I noticed some more prints as I walked but I still didn’t believe what I was seeing. I found some that seemed to continue on further but I did not follow them since I had planned to go a few miles into the Wenaha-Tucannon Wilderness and didn’t want to waste time. It also looked like there was a foot impression on a log that had fallen across the spring. This all seemed too surreal to me because there were lots of prints everywhere even some that appeared smaller, possibly a juvenile animal, but they were just thin outlines. I had never seen prints like these in person so I was unsure what I was even looking at. I kept walking and came to a clearing on the side of a grade where I found a print that was about 3 inches deep and well defined. I could see the big flat foot, the toes and heel. Suddenly I thought wow these prints are for real. I now had a feeling one of these creatures could be around any corner. I got to the top of one of the mountains to get a nice view of the wilderness area and then made my way back to camp. When I got back I was pretty tired from hiking. The two other people at the campground left in their pickup shortly after I got there and I went to relax in my tent. I was the only one at the campground now. About an hour later I heard the same low rumbling growl sound from earlier. I realized that my car had now been off for 3 or 4 hours, and there was really no way it could be the car. I was hearing more knocking and like I had earlier. It sounded like someone was smacking a branch against a tree. I realized whatever creature this was; it must be the same one that came by before because the knocking and the low growl started at the same time after being silent for so long. It sounded like it was in the same area behind my campsite where I had heard the thump earlier. It was now about 7 pm, about 2 hours until dark. Being there by myself made me very nervous, especially with the growling noise and tree knocking apparently being directed toward me and my campsite. I got out of there as fast as I could. I got back to town and felt very paranoid. I spent time walking downtown Walla Walla calming myself down and recounting the events. I had never been so scared of the outdoors. People noticed I looked visibly shaken though I had not mentioned the incident. It was hard to even tell anyone in fear of them thinking I was crazy.",I set up camp at Skyline Campground (formerly Squaw Springs Campground)It is along Kendall Skyline Road.

"in october of 2008 i was hunting in the white river unit. after being camped for three days i was sitting at the camp fire with my father at around 1:00am when we heard this sound like we have never heard in our life of being in the woods, it sounded almost exactly like one of your recordings except a little bit higher pitched. we heard this sound about every three to thirty minutes until we decided it was getting a little to close for our comfort and went to the dalles for breakfast at about 2:30 am. we came back the next morning and finished out the hunting season without anymore odd noises. so needless to say we drew the same tag this season. so three days into the hunt being October 5th 2009 me and my best friend decided to go hunt a canyon that was across road 4430 from our camp at around 8:30am. As we were driving about 60 yards down the road, we see a black creature that i would say to be around seven feet tall come running up the the steep bank and across the road at an unhuman speed. about 10-15 feet behind it another creature of the same size and color came running across at an ever faster speed. Needless to say i gunned it to try to get closer to get a better look at what i had just seen. within about 10mseconds they were long gone into the manzanita bushes. i got out of the truck and was listening and could hear nothing at all. with the hair on my neck standing up and goose bumps me and my friend went back to camp and started telling my father what had just happened. He found it comical and thought that we were trying to mess with him until that night when my friend was almost in tears begging to leave the woods. we ended up packing up camp and going home at 10:30pm. so last night me and my father started looking up info. and sightings on bigfoot in the area. After reading all of this we started putting things together, and decided to go back today and look for clues. the first thing that really caught out eyes was reading of their stench. less than 500 yards from whare i saw the creatures cross the street were were cutting wood the day before and noticed a rotten small that we had smelled about 5 years before when camped by there. so we decided to go look for tracks and to see what was making the bad smell. so when we go there we decided to go look for the smell first. Its strongest point ended up being down this grown over cat road about 400 yards. we could find nothing that would be causing the smell but the one thing that really gave my goose bumps was there was small trees about three inches in diameter snapped about two feet up laying across the road where the smell was the most potient.(I read the night before to watch for small broken trees. after not finding anything that could be causing this smell we decided to go look for tracks where they crossed the street. after looking for about twenty minutes we found what look like a long and wide print that had no distinguishable toes or tread. about 15ft from the print we found some feces that were what i thought to be a bear but my dad said noway so needless to say i now have a bag of s*&t that i have no idea what it came from. now to describe the figures we say run across the road. they ran completely upright and at speeds of a deer. i could not really see its face. it had longer arms that than a human and ran straight armed. and last it was solid black",,Wasco County,Oregon,Fall,Report 26718: Late night road crossing sighting by hunters near the eastern boundary of Mt.

"This sighting happened over 1 year ago. I happened upon your site recently, although I did write to George Noory about the sighting 10 months ago. I am a truck driver. I was headed north on US Route 69. Another truck was passing me and his cab was just about 5 feet from the front of my truck. Off to my right I saw a something running towards the road. The other truck locked up his breakes and I slowed down to keep from hitting it. It took only 2 steps to cross both lanes of the highway, went down the median and crossed the southbound lanes. It ran upright and held its arms to its side as opposed to having its elbows bent like a man would . Its hands where down to its knees. It was covered with dark hair I'd guess about 6 or 7 in long. The ""thing"" glanced our way as it ran and seem to have dark or black eyes. It was taking long strides and was slightly bent at the waist.

""hoo, hoo hoot"" it was loud. it sounded close to me and i was in the front yard. but she said it came from not more than 10ft from her. she stoped startled.

We were about 100 yards from approaching an intersection when I saw a [dark hair-covered, manlike] creature on two legs crossing the intersection we were about to turn on.  It was running fast and it looked like it possibly stepped over a barbwire fence.

"My family resides close to Norman, Oklahoma, and from 1976 to the present, there have been numerous incidents revolving around Bigfoot, including two sightings in 1976 and one in January 2003, footprints in both mud and snow, several incidents where vocalization was heard, and numerous other accounts of stones being thrown, foul odor being smelled, fruit being taken off of trees, etc. Back in 1976, Bigfoot researcher Bob Stamps and his partner took several plaster casts of footprints and interviewed family members who had heard and seen the creature. The most recent sighting happened in January of this year. My 61-year old brother-in-law was chopping wood and breaking kindling approximately 40 feet from his house near the edge of the woods. It was early evening and he was just about to finish when he happened to look up and caught the sight of the creature out of the corner of his eye. At that point, the creature was approximately 15-18 feet away from him, standing in enough of a clearing so that he could see him from the waist up (due to thick underbrush he could not see any further down). He estimated the creature to be 7-8 feet tall with a slight hunch.  He froze for a minute and then dropped the wood that was in his hands and ran inside of the house. By the time he entered the house he was visibly shaken and according to my sister, he was ""as white as a ghost."" The hair on his arms were standing on end caused by physical reaction of goosebumps due to the state he was in. He was having difficulty breathing and therefore was having a hard time speaking. All he could say was ""Buh...buh...buh..."" My sister and niece thought he was having a heart attack and were fearing for his life.

"At about 11pm, after sitting silently in front of the campfire for a couple of hours, I all of a sudden started hearing a single, loud wailing sound.  It sounded like a cross between a wolf and 'tarzan'.  Somewhat human, but definitely not. The high-pitched howl that at first I thought was a wolf, became louder and longer, and was moving slowly through the woods about a quarter mile from me at most. It would stop briefly, then continue, sounded like something in pain or extremely lonely or lost, calling out for others. I heard no other calls in response, and I didn't utter a sound because I didn't want to scare it off. I was mesmerized.  It kept sounding off for about 10 minutes, then gone. It was not close enough to hear footsteps associated with it. VERY Loud vocalizations. When I realized that I've heard wolves, coyotes, and cougars before, I knew this was nothing of the sort. That's when my whole body got chills as I realized that I must be hearing a 'Sasquatch'. I can't say I had really ever considered that they exist or not. I was certainly open, but skeptical. Not Anymore!

"Three strange things in three days: I woke up one morning and went into the trailer to get a cup of coffee and we had two dogs and I let them out and the little dog took off somewhere. I decided to go and look for her. I started walking up the hill right behind the trailer and I got up to a rock face were I could look down on the other side of the hill. I couldn't see anything and I was tired from walking up the hill, so I sat down to have a smoke. I sat there for about five minutes and was looking at the great view. Then I heard the dog bark and I turned my head and looked back and all I saw was a 7-8 foot tall black streak running down the hill. I jumped up and started following it; I couldn't see it but I could here it crashing through the brush. I got down to the bottom of the hill were there was a clearing. When I got down to that clearing, the crashing noise stopped. Then on the second day, I decided to go for a walk early in the morning. I walked to the top of the hill and walked down going north. When I got to the middle of the hill,  the hair on the back of my neck stood up and I got goose bumps. I looked behind me and beside me but didn't see anything, so I started walking again. I walked across the top of the hill and then walked through another clearing that would take me back to camp. I walked through the clearing and saw the trailer and my little brother- he was sitting out side - I waved to him and I walked back up over the same hill. I didn't see anything at all but when I got back to camp, my mom, her boyfriend and my little brother said that my little brother saw something orange in color walking on two legs, following me. My mom said she had never seen him that scared before and her boyfriend was out going to the bathroom and when he walked back to camp my little brother saw the top of his head through the trailer window and he had long hair and she said my brother freaked out and said that it was coming to get him. On the third day, after I knew that something was following me, I walked back up the same hill and when got half way up it, I could hear something. I looked up the hill and there were branches of trees about 2-4 inches thick and about 3-4 feet long being thrown down the hill at me. My mom's boyfriend has heard three very loud screams come out of the canyon only about a 3/4 mile away from the trailer.","About 10 air miles N. of Granite, just east of North Trail Creek.

"At about 7:00 pm I was taking a walk along the eastern edge of Call Meadow.  I had parked before the cattle gate on the southern end.  Cattle were grazing toward the south end of the meadow, and also in the woods to the east, but they were fenced out of the meadow, where I was walking on an old road.  I'd gone maybe about 500 ft. and heard, off to the southwest, near the E-W fenceline, in the woods on the other side of the meadow, a really horrible noise.  I've worked in the woods on the coast for almost 20 yrs., and have been camping over in the Malheur for about as long, and I have never heard anything like it.  It was very loud, like a cow bellowing but it wasn't a cow.  It's hard to describe, or even remember exactly, but it was almost like a scream, but not a scream, it almost sounded like something may have been in a lot of pain, or maybe just really mad.  It went on for at least a minute or more.  I was listening, and a first thought coyote, but it didn't sound like a coyote.  I have heard that cougars can scream like a woman, but it didn't sound like that.  I was most impressed by how loud it was.  It was probably about 1000 ft. away from me.  I could see across the meadow, and kept watching while I headed back for the rig.  It was pretty scary, so I cut my walk short.","South end of Call Meadow, north of Junction of FS road 28 and 2850.

"On Tuesday, September 24, 2002 I was hiking alone on the Ruckel Creek trail near Cascade Locks. The time was about 4 p.m. I was beginning descending from the area known as The Benson Plateau. Although I am not sure of my exact position it was probably close to 45 deg. 38' 21"" N, 121 deg. 52' 24"" W at an elevation of about 3,300 feet. The trail was very dry and dusty and the steep decent required that I walk very carefully. As a result I made almost no sound at all. There was suddenly a very loud crashing sound from close by and my thoughts were that a bear had been surprised. At first I saw nothing, but the sound indicated that an animal was fleeing up the steep hillside. Then for about two seconds from a distance of about a hundred feet I could clearly see what looked like a large guerrilla running up the hill. Only the back was visible and it was black. The animal was only visible from the waist up. It had powerful back and shoulders and a very large head that rose to a distinct hump much as it does in pictures of some apes. I do not know how big it was other then to say it was a lot bigger then me. The head was particularly massive I thought. The animal apparently tripped and fell forward, but caught itself and kept moving up through the dense thicket. At that moment it turned its head enough for me to see its head and face in profile. It had a distinct nose but there was little else I could distinguish. At this point I went for my camera. This took a few seconds. When I looked up again I could see motion but could not make out the animal. There was a fallen tree about a hundred and fifty feet up the hill and it began to rock up and down at a uniform rate of about 1 HZ. It made a corresponding creaking and rubbing sound and this continued for some time, perhaps fifteen seconds keeping my attention drawn to that spot but seeing nothing but the tree bobbing up and down like it was being deliberately shaken at a uniform amplitude. Then it suddenly stopped and I could hear nothing. Then I noticed some motion about fifty feet to the right of the tree and thought I could see a face looking at me. The face seemed smaller that the animal I had saw but it still looked like a face and shoulders against a lighter backdrop. I stood with the camera ready knowing that the animal was still there and expecting it to stand up and again show itself. But this waiting game went on for perhaps two minutes. Then I began to wonder if the animal was in fact gone and perhaps I was looking at some strangely shaped stump because it did not move and I could not see it well enough to tell exactly what it was. At this point I took a picture thinking I might blow up the photo later for closer study to determine if anything was in fact there. It occurred to me that I should move around a bit and try to find a better angle. But there was no better position then where I was and caution prohibited me from moving closer. When I returned to my original position I no longer could see the face. I stayed around and listened and watched for a while but noticed nothing. The trail itself was very dusty and took prints well. My own prints were very clear but there were no other prints that I could see. During the incident I smelled nothing. When the digital picture was lightened and adjusted for contrast the head that appeared to be looking at me did look like it could be real. But in the background was what could be another far bigger animal. The larger image in the background is about the right size for the animal I saw. But the front looks like a light tan. I just took the picture and that is all I know about it. The picture quality is poor. Obviously if the animals were willing to pose I might have done better. I went back to the site two times to try to locate the exact position from clues in the picture but have been unable to relocate it exactly. I wanted to get another look and take another picture from the same location just to make sure I was not seeing something that just looked like what I was trying to see. The interesting part is right in the middle of the picture and needs lightning to see properly. I did go back about two days later and explore the place where the animal might have been headed. This area is called Rudolf Spur. All I found there was a pile of shit that was flat as a pancake and looked like tar. It was the size a large human might leave.","On the Ruckel Creek trail, near Cascade Locks Oregon at a point somewhere between the Mark Hatfield Wilderness boundary and the first switchback going down the hill, at about 3,300 feet elevation.

"My friend B.P. and I decided to spend an evening at Eagle Creek State Park along the Columbia River on I-84 at milepost 41 East of Portland, OR. We had a cook out  camp fire in the Community Kitchen there. It was on April 9th, 2001, a Monday, which we purposely chose to avoid the crowds. Not that there are many people out there in the Winter but a Monday evening will usually guarantee no others will be around. It was cold out, just above freezing, and it had been raining quite a bit earlier.  We had a nice dinner. We had cooked on our portable BBQ earlier in the evening which had included BBQ steak. We had already picked up and put away all of our gear so we were ready to go when we wanted to. At 11:50 PM we had just looked at our watches thinking it was time to go, when from across the creek, about 200 yards away, came a shrieking yell that both startled and shocked us. The yell came from across the creek, up on a ridge due west of us.   At first I thought it was an emergency siren going off at nearby Bonneville Dam, but the siren quality of yell quickly turned into a very breathy roar of some very large animal. It lasted about 10 seconds. We stared at each other in disbelief. Before either of us could utter a word, another yell, just like the first, came from behind the Community Kitchen no more that 100 feet from us.  This was the first time that I had ever experienced the hair standing up on the back of my neck.  I thought I would have been able to identify any animal that lived in the forests of Oregon but this call was completely new to me. We stood there silent, listening for about 5 minutes. We knew that we were right in the middle of the two calls so maybe these two animals were going to meet right where we were standing.  We then decided to leave. I was so glad. When I was inside my truck we locked the doors right away. We did leave our left-over food behind for them in case they were interested in that. I was skeptical about Bigfoot before but I try to keep an open mind.  The only place I have heard the same exact calls since was in a film that was a 70's Class B movie called The Bermuda Triangle. Another thing to note on that occasion was that the snow line was unusually low still for that time of year. We thought that maybe this had driven these bigfoots down low in search of food.

"My wife, daughter and I were towing our trailer up to a local camp site on a Saturday morning for an overnight campout. I was driving along on the Prospect/Butte Falls highway. I came around a corner and was slowed down to about 30 mph. As we turned the corner, about 40 yards down the road on the right hand side, I saw what I thought was a man take a step from the road into the forest. I clearly saw an arm swing and a leg. What struck me strange was that he was pitch black from head to toe. I said to my wife, ""What was that?"" She said, ""I don't know."" At this point I am still thinking that it was a person, but that it was strange. There was a dirt logging road that crossed the highway right where the creature was standing. I started slowing down and expected to see a person, or a truck or camper on the road. As we went by and looked, there was nothing there. We continued down the road and my wife and I talked about what we had seen. My daughter was in the back seat of the truck and did not see anything. I all happened very quickly. I did not see anything until it moved as I was proocuppied by driving and towing. My wife saw it standing there by the road before it moved and clearly saw hair and could see both sides of the torso. I kept running over in my mind what it might have been. I have lived in this area all of my life and have seen every animal that lives in the woods. This did not fit in any catagory. The only thing that color is a black bear, and this clearly was not a bear. We finally agreed that it may have been a bigfoot. We decided to hurry to out camp and drop the trailer and get back down and look for tracks. I had my camera and my intention was to find some tracks and get some pictures of them. We went to camp and hurried back to the spot. The time since we went by was about an hour. The logging road turned out to be very dry and hard. I searched all around in the forest and on the other side of the highway for tracks, but could not find anything that was clearly a bigfoot track. I went back to were it was standing an stood in the same spot and was looking up in the tree standing there looking for a bees nest or something that perhaps a bear might be interested in. I was still trying to eliminate all other possibilities. Then it occured to me that when I had seen this creature step off of the road that it had stepped behind some branches on this tree. As I looked up I realised that the branches were way above my head. I am 6' 4"". This thing was big. That convinced me.",Go to Butte Falls. Go through town.

"This happened in early to mid October 2011 when my wife and I were driving west towards mile marker 26 on Hwy 66 in southern Oregon to go hunting. To the best of my recollection this is what happened: It was between mile marker 26-27. My wife were cruising along at 45-55 miles an hour. While heading to a hunting location we will still be looking for deer but going at a faster speed till we get to our next dirt road. I call this speed hunting. We were driving a stretch of this highway and it was just before mile marker 26, on the east side. It was kind of straight with a small bump or hill in the road in the near distance. I was driving and on my left was an area next to the road that was slightly treed but easy to see through. We could see about a 100 yards straight back off the road before it became more heavily treed. Coming up fast on our left was where the trees got thick again and this semi clearing was going to end. So I would call this an L shaped tree line. Running to our left, away from the road and us we saw something moving very fast. My observation of what I saw was a 7-8 foot tall, hairy creature running almost full throttle. Since I was the one driving I couldn’t give my 100 % full attention to this thing running. The things that I did notice were it was very hairy, ran on 2 legs and had long arms. To be more specific, the hair was black and flowing from head to waist. Black hair from head to torso then a reddish cinnamon hair color from torso to waist. I can’t remember from the waist down for some reason. I think it happened too fast and I was a little caught off guard. It was sprinting but for some reason I didn’t feel it was full speed. I’m pretty sure it was running because we caught it off guard and spooked it. What I did notice was it looked like a lot of the Bigfoot that I have seen on TV shows. So after we passed it I looked at my wife and I asked her “did you see that?” She said yes. We both agreed we just saw a Bigfoot but yet part of us just wanted to say no we didn’t!  We talked a little about it and kind of dismissed it having second guessing ourselves. So the next year it was hunting time again and we found ourselves going down Hwy 66 again. We started looking for the same spot we had our encounter. Both of us had really never talked about this the past year. So I brought it up again to my wife and I described what I saw the previous year. Strangely enough our remembrance of what we both saw was pretty close. We’ve been hunting for years and have seen a lot of animals out in the wild. We have seen Antelope, Elk, Deer, Bear, Bison, Bobcats, Emu, Turkeys and other creatures. We know for a fact it was not anything we had ever seen before. This thing stayed on 2 legs and never went down on all fours. My wife and I are not attention seekers and have nothing to gain from this. We enjoy just keeping a low profile in life but we felt we should say something about what we saw. I figure no one in there right mind would put on a Sasquatch suit during hunting season to get attention.

"This sighting took place while I was on a fishing trip with my girlfriend, another couple, and their mom. My friends were staying at the resort cabins at one of my favorite fall fishing lakes. By the time we arrived (delayed by wiring problems on my boat trailer) it was about 3 a.m.  We talked untill there was little reason to go to bed, just to have to get right back up to catch the morning bite. About an hour-and-a-half before sunrise my friend Wes and I decided to go for a little walk down to one of the streams that feed out of the lake.  I was curious to see what the fish were doing. We both had flashlights, shining them into the stream as we walked along trying to spot fish. The further we went, the more uneasy I became and I have been in these woods all of my life and never felt like this ever. I asked Wes if he felt kind of weird he said, ""Kind of.""  We decided we'd head back. We moved to a different cabin closer to the lake. After the evening fish I returned at late light, bummed about missing a very large brown trout.  I spent most of the evening listening to fish jump and looking at stars. Wes' mom went to bed first and about 11:45p.m the rest of us went to bed. My girlfriend and I were not sleeping in the cabin with Wes and his family. We were sleeping in the back of a full size Chevy Surburban, mainly because Angela and I wanted a little privancy.  Angela and didn't go right to sleep. This was about an hour-and-a-half after everyone said good night at the camp fire. I sat up to smoke a cigarette and I was looking out the rear side window when something caught my eye. The cabins where we were staying are not very large. There was outdoor lighting attached to the middle of the roof line of the cabin. At first I thought it was the wind moving the tree branches or bushes but something wasn't right.  I then began to realize was I was seeing. I thought maybe I was a little more tired than I thought and that my eyes were playing tricks on me. Except the trick didn't go away. Just to make sure, I asked Angela to sit up and look around and tell me what she sees. I totally expected to look stupid and have her tell me she saw nothing. I did not tell her what I was seeing or where I was seeing it.  I looked down at the floor. Angela sat up and it wasn't even two seconds before she visually locked onto the same thing I did. Still looking at the floor, I asked, "" What do you see."" Her first word was, ""Yeti,"" and with that things now felt real.   We both became excited, scared, and curious.  I was a bit more uneasy with how the bigfoot was moving and acting. It was about 50 feet away back in the tree line on the other side of the cabin, about 15 feet away from Wes' mom's truck. It was standing just out of the light, so as not be directly seen. It was about 7-1/2 to 8 feet tall, covered in hair,  very broad in the shoulder and across the chest.  It wasn't as bulky as what is in the Patterson film.  What made me very uneasy was its movements and actions. It wasn't coming forward. It had one arm up above its head and to the side, resting on a tree.  It was rapidly rocking from side to side, and bobbing up and down. Angela made a statement about getting out to maybe get closer to it.  I was in the process of telling her, ""No!""  when the next surprise was realized. Anglea points out that there's more than one. About two feet behind the tailgate of my friend's moms truck, was crouched not one, but two of what appeared to be smaller bigfoots. They were crouched close together, sitting motionless and looking directly at us. They looked like they were younger ones, compared to the big one still rocking back and forth by the tree. They were not as broad in the shoulders or chest. Angela and I wondered what to do, quietly talking to each other for five or ten minutes. I decided to wake up Wes by yelling toward the window of his bedroom, which was in the middle of the back wall of the cabin. Wes answered back and I told him to look out his window.  At first he couldn't see anything through the window. I didn't tell him what to look for or what I was seeing for fear of him thinking we were pulling a joke or that we were totally out of  our minds. As he opened the window, I asked him, ""Do you see it?"" His response was, ""Oh, my #%&^@ God!"" Wes didn't say another word, which made me even more uneasy. I couldn't deal with it anymore.  I jumped up to the front seat and was gonna start up the rig to back them off a little.  When I got up front, I couldn't find the keys. I became a bit panicky. I found the keys and started up the Chevy with a big ""vrooom!"" and it hardly seem to bother them. I then decided if I was going to see Bigfoot, then by god, I'm gonna try to get a good look!! I was parked in such a way that I had to pull way out and swing the front end around for my lights to hit them directly.  As soon as the Chevy moved, they took off back into the trees and bushes. I then headed down the road toward a picnic aera where they might cross the road. On the way, Angela said she had enough and didn't want to be around the bigfoot anymore. I turned around, ended up taking a wrong turn finding, and myself driving cross country through the cabins and the resort. I was turned around so badly I didn't know where I was.  Angela spotted the cabin where we stayed the first night. I then began to drive out to the highway to leave because Angela didn't want to return until daylight. Just before I got to the highway, I remembered my friends at the cabin and the fact that they had their newborn baby with them.  Angela agreed we couldn't leave them there, so we returned.  Wes said that as we were driving off, something ran across the road behind us on two legs. Angela and I decided to leave the Chevy parked halfway blocking the road and go inside the cabin.  After we got inside, I asked Wes if he'd seen what we saw, because I still could not take in the fact that this really happened. Wes told me he definitely saw what he belives to be a bigfoot. he explained that he became silient because of the two smaller ones at the back of his mom's truck. After twenty minutes had gone by, I needed a smoke real bad and Wes' mom wanted something to drink. Both were in my rig.  Wes was the first to step out side. On the way back to the cabin,  we heard a bunch of comotion down toward the lake, like something running through bushes, snapping and breaking limbs. We ran to the front door of the cabin. Just as we started up the steps, I fell onto the porch, scaring Wes to death. Once inside, we talked and tried to rationalize everything that had happened. Things were quiet outside from then on, other than the fact that a raccoon thumped on our door, which startled us.  What was strange was that the raccoon seem to want to come into the cabin.  The raccoon did not touch any of the food outside the cabin.","Suttle Lake Resort (east end of Suttle Lake) off the Santiam Highway (Hwy 22) east fo the Santiam Pass,  cabin # 6",Jefferson County,Oregon,Fall,Report 5610: Three guests at Suttle Lake Resort get long look at three sasquatches,44.42565,-121.726,10/24/2002,5610,Class A,9rckwp3y4t,55.83,36.555,17.28,17.01,0.43,,0.61,,,rain,,Clear throughout the day.,0,,68,0.21

"A friend and I were driving from Vancouver, WA, to Eureka, CA, at about 11.45 pm late in July of 2002. We were lucky enough that the road opened on the same day we planned to travel as it had been closed much of the week before because of the sour biscuit fire. Anyway, we were both alert as we were excited about seeing the effects of the fire and indeed some of it was still burning in isolated pockets all around the road. There was very little traffic that night. I was suprized at first by seeing movement on the left side of the road. My first reaction was hitchhiker? then a millisecond later my brain said ""bear?!.. standing...upright?  then another fraction of a second and the creature was in the road in the open right in full view of my high beams. At that time I jokingly said ""There he goes right there"" as I told my friend earlier that bigfoot was supposedly seen in this area before. About the same time my mind was coming to the realization that it was not a bear because it was walking on two feet and my friend started to make this ""hooo hooo!"" kind of sound and pulled his legs up to his chest fetal style. Now I must interject at this point that my friend and I are not easily frightened and also that he is 6'4"" and to pull his legs up to his chest in a Toyota 4Runner is not the easiest of movements. Thats when I was gripped in a fear that I have never known not even when the Cali police have pulled their weapons on me, not when I was surrounded by Yurok indians drunk and pissed off at me and my entire race. But at that moment I was stricken with a fear that I can only say was instinctual as I was not terrified but something deep inside me said"" Get the f... away from here now!""  Please excuse my language but that is as close as I can descibe my feelings at the time. When the fear hit, me my right foot immediately floored the accellerator, not in an attempt to hit the creature but in an attempt to get away from it. That last little bit of info bothers me to say openly as I have always been interested in things that are supposedly mysterious and I am not someone who would ever be called weak-willed. I wish in hind sight that I would have slowed down or even stopped but my instincts took over and all thoughts of interest in the creature were not even in my mind at the time. The creature was at least seven feet tall, more like eight feet, as it was a full foot taller than my 4x4. I am in construction by trade and I am fairly adept at estimating sizes as I have to do it all the time. It was covered in fur/hair medium to dark brown. Long arms and legs, with each appendage not having any parts out of proportion with the other parts of the same appendage.  Which I mean to say is that the calves were not overly long in comparison to the thighs and so forth. The only time I saw the arm go down it went past its knee and the individual fingers flexed, although I will admit to not getting many details. [My eyes] did get drawn to the shoulder area which was very wide and that's when I noticed something that makes me think it was not a trick or hoax. The muscles in the shoulder areas and between them bulged independently. I could see little muscles under the fur ripple in various ways when it moved like an animal, not at all like a bulky costume or a hide worn by a person that would move in a more uniform and less isolated way. The head was somewhat conial and sat upon a thick short neck. I unfortunately didn't see the face up close so I can supply no clear details. I did get a glimpse of the face when it first hit the road and heard us coming, though. It was too far to detail anything accurate but it was wide with very little in the way distinguishable features. When the creature saw us it seemed to pick up speed but never ran or even trotted, just seemed to increase its pace. Now this thing walked directly in front of my truck at very little distance in full view of my high beams. If this was a trick, someone spent a lot of time, money, expertise, and genius to pull it off on a road that was until a few hours before was closed to all traffic. Not impossible but I dont think so. The most unsettling thing for me (besides the abstract fear) was the way the creature moved - something familiar about it. Now I've seen many shows playing what are supposedly films of bigfoot and how it could be faked. But in these reeactments the fakes are easily seen for what they are. Someone in a suit or with fur covering them trying to move like and ape, which usually turns out very mechanical and almost obvious. This creature moved with extreme fluidity and smoothess. All appendages moved at the same time, head turning, legs moving, arms moving, all with the same fluidity. After the creature moved across the road to the trees on the right side, we both looked at each other and said ""No way!"" with very wide eyes. A few minutes later we came to the first signs of civilization when we passed a Ford Explorer on the side of the road with three firefighters in it. The driver's side doors were both open and I saw the faces of two of them and they looked amazed or shocked. I think they were just a few minutes ahead of us and they may have seen something too or they were the culprits of an very elaborate and expert hoax. If there were any other reports in the area or if it is possible to talk to some of the firefighters fighting the fire in the region I would like to speak to them. Please any info you might have would help.

"I was just browsing Google earth tonight and clicked on some place marks that turned out to be links to your big foot sighting page. The place marks were on the Big Tree loop at the Oregon Caves and it perked my interest because I have ridden my dirt bike through those mountains and made it to the caves from the Applegate Lake side. After reading those reports I think I should share with you guys something that happened to me on the Sturgis Creek trail. Sturgis Creek trail is at the base of mount Elijah which is probably 2 miles to the east of the Oregon Caves. The trail will take you from mount Elijah all the way to the Big Tree loop where you can then walk down to the cave area. The first time I went to the trail was in mid spring of 2005 and I got my truck stuck in the snow. I tried to get it out and decided I should probably walk back down and find a phone unfortunately not knowing that it was 14 miles to the nearest house with a phone. As I started walking down the road something started screaming / howling from the trail head area behind me. I know what mountain lions, wolves and coyotes sound like and this was nothing like that. The only thing I can compare the sound to be the howling I’ve heard in the werewolf movies. It sounded like a deep screaming howl, and it echoed off the valley walls very loudly. It repeated probably seven times, and I was getting really nervous. The most distinctive thing about the sound is it didn’t die out like you hear with wolf and coyote howls, it would end abruptly and start again. Luckily I had my 45 caliber carbine rifle with me and I had the safety off for at least four miles after hearing that. I was pretty freaked for a while. I walked backwards for at least a mile and was constantly watching my back after that. After reading the reports from 2000 in the cave area I think there’s something around there, I just hope I don’t run into it especially if it’s screaming like that.",Take Carberry Creek road from Applegate Lake west to Sturgis Fork Road then west then NFD 1020 to NFD 600.,Josephine County,Oregon,Spring,Report 14891: Hiker reports possible vocalizations near Oregon Caves.,42.0833,-123.3333,4/15/2005,14891,Class B,9r2r3mp2vz,53.13,,,32.94,0.72,,0.23,0,0,,,Clear throughout the day.,0,,220,1.07
"I recently moved into this house in May of 2004 and when exploring found different animal trails. Thinking they were deer, I occasionally follow them. After seeing that deer like to feed in the lawn area, I started putting apples and other fruit out for them. Within the last couple of months I have heard some things at night and when I checked I never saw anything but I always would smell a strong musky odor. The dog would go out barking; I knew he would come back in smelling like a skunk. He always came right back without a smell. When he went out chasing deer, he would always stay out for some time. I started to put fruit out on the table by the house. In the morning it was gone. A couple of nights ago I awoke with the motion sensor light coming on. I smelled that smell but by the time I got to my feet to look out the window all I saw was something large and dark walking on two legs, heading back into the trees. Unfortunately, the creature had moved into the shadows. The ground is solid so I have not been able to see tracks of anything, not even the deer that I do see crossing the property. I smell him almost nightly and continue to try to get a better look at him. I could not honestly tell if it was Bigfoot or a man but from where I saw him he was walking past a pull trailer and he stood with his shoulders well above the top. I am 5'5"" and the trailer is taller then I stand. This is why I THINK I may have a Bigfoot around. I often feel like I am being watched. One last thing. When I first moved here, I had chickens and each night 1 or 2 would end up missing. There where never any feathers around so whatever took them carried them off. A coyote, racoon, skunk, etc. would kill at the site and there would have been feathers. I never did find any feathers, not even near the house.

"I had lived in Indiana for a few years and had returned to Oregon in 2005. I was so excited to be back home; even the air smells sweeter when I got back. I would get in my car and just drive sometimes. One day, winter of 2006, my daughter and I drove up to the Oregon Caves and then meandered back towards Redwood Highway. I decided to stop at a park on the outskirts of Cave Junction to smoke and stretch my legs. It was winter and nobody else was in the park, very quiet and cold. We walked down to the river, randomly talking about how pretty it was. Out of the corner of my right eye I saw someone walking in the river. My first thought was of concern because it was so cold and I could not imagine anyone being in the river except if there were an emergency. I turned my head and all I remember seeing was a very large dark person (It walked like a human). I don't remember much after that except sheer panic. My hair was standing on end and I yelled at my daughter to ""RUN""!!! I didn't even look back to make sure my daughter was behind me, I figured I could hear her footsteps and that was good enough. All I could think about was whatever that thing was, it wouldn't take long for it to catch up to us before we made it to the car. Once we were in the car I don't even recall how fast we got back to the highway. I stopped in a parking lot once we were in Cave Junction and tried to calm down. We hadn't even spoken to each other until then. My daughter finally asked me, ""Mom, what was that?"" I told her that I had no idea, maybe it was a bear. Her reply was that it didn't look or walk like a bear and it was too big to be a bear. I agreed with her but I didn't have any other answer at that time. I honestly cannot recall a time when I have been that panicked especially considering that there really was no reason to panic. This thing was far enough down river that I could not make out details of its face and it was just ""strolling"" through the water. It was not making threatening movements at all. I had pretty much convinced myself it had to have been a bear and forgot about the incident until recently when I saw a bear while hiking. I have seen bears in the past but this bear was quite close and it didn't really bother me. I just turned around and walked back the way I came in. It occurred to me as odd that being alone, seeing a bear ahead of me (with my car quite far away) I felt no panic and very little fear. I couldn't understand my fear of whatever was walking in the river. It was much farther away than this bear had been, my car was much closer and I was not alone...I was in a public park not far at all from Cave Junction, I mean it really bothered me.","At the ""Forks"" Park right outside of Cave Junction.",Josephine County,Oregon,Winter,Report 26646: Daylight sighting by mother and daughter at the Illinois River outside Cave Junction,42.16024,-123.6216,11/15/2006,26646,Class A,9r2pfgj3py,53.71,49.745,45.78,39.25,0.78,,0.84,0.0213,1,rain,,Rain starting in the evening.,0,,204,3.02

Several times we heard what sounded like a branch hitting a tree. The sound was the same each time, two cracking sounds spaced about two seconds apart. My wife thinks that the sound may have been heating or cooling of a burnt out tree, cracking as it expands or contracts. We were in the Biscuit fire area.

"I write this email with a little apprehension of what my son and I heard in late August 2006. My 16 year old son (at the time) and I were on a three day hiking trip in the Siskiyou Mountains of Oregon. We were hiking on trail # 900, to a snow shelter cabin we've been going to for about the last 10-12 years at the time. It is called Greyback shelter off of trail #900 or Obrien Creek Trail. The entire area is wilderness and you can reach the Oregon caves from the same main trail # 1207, also called the Siskiyou/Rogue division trail. On the southwest side of the cabin there is a huge meadow where there used to be another cabin built in the 40's by cattlemen. On the third and final morning we woke up in the shelter where we had camped. And, I had to answer natures call, my son was just getting woke up when I told him I would be back in a few minutes. I walked to the meadow where there is an old outhouse type thing just to the back of the old cabin that stood there, and well... After, I had finished, I remember feeling like I was being watched, and I walked toward the path that connected the two cabins in the meadow. The meadow is beautiful, so it being about 8:00 - 8:30 AM, I stood at the base of the meadow to enjoy the scenery.  Then, above me I heard a screeching howl/guttural like sound, that lasted a couple of seconds and ended abruptly, and began again, it seemed like it went on for about 2-3 minutes. I stood there looking up to the area I heard the sound and could not see anything, which was weird because it is relatively open meadow with rolls and dips. I didn't recognize the animal making the sound. Like so many of your reports that I have read, I'm a hunter, hiker outdoorsy kind of a guy. And, I had a hard time identifying the sound, still can't. But, it kind of freaked me out. I pulled my pistol and quickly, cautiously went to the cabin were my son was, and We never go to mountains without a firearm, He had heard the sound as well, and he had pulled his weapon, he knew it was me coming I was calling him to let him know it was me, as I came around the cabin I saw my son looking in the same direction as I had when we both heard the sound, he was as white as a sheet. We were both very visible shaken. He then asked me ""DAD, what the hell was that?"" I know my son is a teenager, I know he cusses, but not around me at the time. We ate and uneasy breakfast and packed our gear and headed out, a lot earlier than we would normally. All the way down the trail back to my truck we constantly check our back trail, it only being about a mile and half down and out of the area it was probably my longest hike. We have not been back to the cabin since, and that was just over 2 years ago. I would also like to add that the sounds we heard that day are similar to two of your sound clips 1973 Puyallup and the 1978 Snohomish county whoops/ howls. But, with a little more guttural grunt that ended abruptly, it did not taper off like a coyote, fox, wolf or elk; it just stopped and started again. My name is B. H., and I lived in Medford, Oregon.

We kept talking about a ""strange bird sound""...the ""Whoop-Whoop- Whoop""...and just dismissed it as some weird bird.

"While I was archery hunting on Aug 31, 2004 near Maxwell Butte, I found two tracks that measured 14x5 inches, both tracks had a prominent large toe on the side of the track. The tracks were not together but on the same ridge. I also found a feces pile that was like bear in contents (berry seeds) but much larger and more human-like.  it was like a fifty cent piece in diameter and 12-14 inches long. I had a visitor the next morning at 4 am. I was sitting in my dimly lit tent listening for elk bugling. I woke at 3 am and was wide awake drinking coffee and hoping to get a head start on my hunt by hearing elk. I was surprised by a low growl that sounded like it came from my stomach. I thought it was odd that I didn't feel it, but as soon as that thought crossed my mind a loud scraping sound was followed by a loud thud that came from the thick patch of trees next to my tent, only 2-3 feet away, I heard no other sound after that. I slapped the table top [inside the tent] hoping to hear something leave but whatever stomped the ground didn't make another sound. I put my boots on, grabbed an axe and went outside yelling, hoping to scare off the animal but I never heard another sound. I think a bear would have been more obvious. This animal was able to get next to my tent and leave without me noticing anything except for the growl and the stomp.","The tracks were off the Maxwell Butte trail, I had been cutting cross country and would have to draw a map or show someone the exact location; my campsite was just up the road from the blacktop area, second camp site on left - sits across from large reprod.",Linn County,Oregon,Summer,"Report 9289: Elk hunter hears growl, finds footprints, feces.",44.4625,-121.9683,8/31/2004,9289,Class B,9rckbw1kud,79.66,65.995,52.33,49.4,0.64,,0.56,0.0001,0.22,rain,,Clear throughout the day.,0,,281,0.28

They stopped on my side and he heard a loud vocalization type talking and saw a large hand push in the side of the tent using three fingers, about 4-5 inches. I was snoring and my son thought this might have attracted them. We waited inside the tent for a couple hours and could hear movement outside. Nature called and we both went.

"I believe it was in June of 2003 when I was fishing on the Breitenbush River approximately 4 miles upstream from Detroit, OR. The river flows through a fairly steep gorge at this point. Because of a hip replacement I had less than a year before, I moved very slowly and deliberately down to the river. The weather was clear and the ground dry. The river is approximately 50 ft wide, swift, and could be as deep as 10 feet. I had been fishing for about 15 minutes when I heard a loud branch snap across the river. In retrospect, I would say the snap sounded like a dry 3-inch branch snapping. I placed the sound about 20 feet up the bank. Since I was armed and very immobile with my bad hip, I decided to continue fishing. My thought was that there was a bear or elk in the thick brush. I kept an eye on the other bank but soon lost interest. I then heard a second loud snap similar to the first. Now, whatever it was had my attention. There was something big across the river in the brush. However, I was armed and separated by the river. I continued to fish with my eye on the other side. As I continously scanned the area, I observed what I first thought was a man move from right to left through a clearing near the source of the sound. The sighting lasted only about 3 seconds. There was no sound as ""it"" moved. My actual thought was, ""Oh, there's a man over there."" I then thought, ""Damn', he was one big..."" I was approximately 25 yards away when I saw ""it"". As my mind digested the information I realized that what I saw had the profile of a sasquatch. I remember a barrel chest, no neck, and it was bi-pedal. I climbed back over the hill to my car to drive over to the other side. No way could I cross directly. Approximately one quarter of a mile upstream, I found a place to park and a path. The path along the river was well above the point where I spotted ""it"". Because of my hip, I could not cut through the brush to the river. There was no lower path.

"On June 21, 2005, I started a solo bicycle tour from Salem, Oregon that would take me east up into the Mount Hood National Forest, Warm Springs Indian Reservation, Old Mckenzie Pass Hwy just west of Sisters, and then loop back to Salem. On this trip I would have 2 encounters that are up to discussion as to what they were. Let me just start by saying I'm recently a believer in Bigfoot. For several months I've been reading the case histories on the BFRO website, and frankly, I knew that the areas I'd be riding in were prime Bigfoot country. Let me also add that I had no desire to have any kind of Bigfoot encounter because I'm on a bike, I'm alone, I carry no weapon for defense, I'm often camping miles from anywhere, and I scare easily. Well, on Friday June 24th, I was up near Detroit Dam at about 9pm, and was setting up my tent. I was about a 1/2 mile from the boat marina along  what's called the upper arm of Detroit Lake, off Hwy 46, which is fed be the Breitenbush River. So its now about 9:45pm, I'm in the tent just listening to the night sounds, like the flow of the water, the leaves blowing a little in the trees, kind of just getting acclimated to where I was camping, when suddenly I hear this tremendous scream that shook me and filled me with dread. It came from about a mile away, sounded a little higher than middle pitched, like a scream a human might produce more so then an animal, but absolutely could not because of its loudness. This scream lasted about 4 to 5 seconds. It reverberated off the mountainsides in the area. What's more creepy is I was aware that a fisherman had reported to the BFRO a while back of an audible encounter. After the trip I looked it up, its #689, and sure enough this scream came from the area of the first report. I was roughly on the Northeast side of Detroit Lake, and Hoover campground is about a mile further east and south of me. Anyway, this is what I heard; it was definitely a scream and not a howl or a whoop, and frankly, if I had not heard recorded Bigfoot sounds previously, I don't think I would of known what to make of it. It was a little like the Puyallup Whoop-Howl of '73, but did not trail off at the end, was even in pitch the whole time, was louder and more like a scream. The second occurence happened on July 3rd. It was about 7:30pm; I was walking my bike along Hwy 242 (Mckenzie Pass Hwy). I was about 7 miles west of Sisters, OR. It was nice clear weather, sunny and early evening. I was walking the bike because I was too tired to ride, and it was too early to make camp. I was noticing how remote this area is. I had passed  earlier a primitive campground called Cold Springs, and was 2 miles west of it. I noticed there were no more pull-outs for cars and didn't see anything or anybody up there. A car would pass about every 15 minutes. There were trees on either side of the road. It was a very pleasent walk. Well, all of a sudden I heard 4 knocks  come from the woods just to my right about 50 feet away, behind a stand of trees and bushes. At first I thought Bigfoot, having heard wood knocking on the internet; I immediately looked at the road ahead to see if it was up, down or level. Being the bike and gear weighed 80 pounds, I would be able to make my escape only if it was down, and it was. I looked back at the area the knocks came from, and now saw one large bush suddenly shake, and then what sounded like a very low animal-like growl coming from it. At first I thought FLEE, but then thought of reports I'd read on BFRO, how people often filled with terror and ran. So I decided not to do that. I stood there and watched to see what was next, trying to act brave, and stood for about 30 seconds and thought- hell I don't really care what's next, I just wanted out, this ain't gonna be the day I investigate Bigfoot, I actually said to myself -  maybe I'd comeback some other day. So I started walking off, and nothing else happened. I camped about 2 miles west from there. I should say to me this did not sound like a woodpecker, which is often high up in the trees, is faster and more in number of strikes, and is higher pitched. What I heard was four knocks, evenly spaced, coming from about ground level, the sound like that of wood on wood. No one was in the area, no development, it being preserved, protected wilderness. So what made that sound?","To reach first location, take Hwy 22 for about 48 miles to Detoit, turn north on Hwy 46 and go 1/2 mile.

"Nov 13th, 2006: 9:00 pm, dark, rainy and cold. My husband and I had just put our oldest son to bed, and were settling down to watch TV in our living room.  My husband heard ""someone"" screaming ""bizarrely"", very loud far off across our lake, so he opened our back sliding door to get a better listen.  That was when we both heard a, maybe 3 at a time, organized pattern of what can only be described as roaring screams. We knew immediately they were not human.   I had heard the Klamath audio before and this made my hair stand on end because it was exactly the same.  This animal was closer, just across a 6 acre or so lake/pond. We heard probably a total of 4, 3-at-a-time, scream patterns. The individual screams were alarmed, but not frantic.  It seemed to be almost 'responding' to dogs barking.  The 'runs' were all about .5 - 1 second apart.  The interval in between patterns was probably 1 minute or so. All was quiet for about 3 minutes and somewhere in the dark across the lake we heard something very, very large and strong tussle successfully with a dog. At the end of the tussle the dog let out a sharp yelp and we heard a thud.  At that point we (I flipped out) shut the door, locked all the doors, sawed a serious dowel for our back slider, turned on our kids white noise machines and went to listen from another part of the house.  We heard a few more screams but it sounded farther away at this point and then seemed to go away. Whatever tangled with that dog was extremely fast, extremely large and very strong.  Based on what we heard, it sounded like the creature must have either approached or walked past a tied up dog.  We heard a quiet small scuffle probably as the dog tried to bite it.  Then an enormous amount of thudding, bushes rustling, and a loud pained yelp and a thud. All was quiet after that and we heard some quiet splashing in the lake.  The splashing could have been disturbed waterfowl, however.  It was pitch black and we were looking out our back sliding doorway into the blackness basically just trying to listen when this occurred.  The tangle with the dog occurred about 3 minutes after we heard the vocalization pattern.  In total, the vocal pattern seemed to be moving slowly from the northwest end of the lake to the northeast end, where we believe the dog incident occured. I have a BS in zoology from the University of Washington and a considerable amount of outdoors experience.  I have heard all different types of animal calls, screams, etc... I'm even quite good at discerning the subtle differences between a Beluga whale click and a porpoise call. I have perfect pitch and a well trained ear from years of classical voice training.  This was most certainly a primate type call, almost with a Siamang type quality to it. It was most definitely not human, and I'm certain it was not any other animal common around our area (coyote, deer screaming in pain, rabbit, fox, racoon, other).  It was extremely similar to the Klamath falls recording only louder and closer, and it scared me more than anything I've ever encountered.  My husband and I discussed our observations at length.  There is honestly no other explanation for this type of call and activity, though we understand how rare and extraordinary this must be because we live in a settled area near freeways and quite honestly we've never really considered ""bigfoot"" before much more than ""what a neat theory!"" Let me just state again that this was not human.  Not even close. Even a human trying to imitate something like that would have had a 'narrower', more nasal sound as a human just doesn't have the head/throat size to accomplish such volume and tone.  Further, it had a squeal and roar quality at the same time, like nothing I've ever heard except the various recordings, in particular the Klamath.  Also a human scream would have had some identifiable emotion to it (drunk, scared, angry etc...) as humans we're quite good at picking up on tones of other humans.  This had none of that.  It was entirely foreign to us. Update: this morning as I look through my binoculars across the lake, exactly where we heard the dog tussle incident, the neighbor's canoe dock is destroyed.  It looks to just be made of plywood but it's cracked and half-sunk as far as I can tell ","We are a quiet, rural neighborhood located south of Aurora, OR.

"I may have stumbled onto a print by pure accident, while hiking with my niece and nephew in the Siuslaw Natl. Forest, west of Dallas, Or. I will give details of the location later, as not to saturate the site with the public, so I can finish my investigation in the area and get more readings and data... GPS, photos, and history on the area...  Here is what I have thus far.... On the mid afternoon of 24 July, I took my niece age 13, and nephew age 16, to an area I used to hunt and log about 30 years ago west of Dallas, Oregon. Thirty years has changed the area quite a bit as Weyerhauser has bought up a lot of the land, Boise and Hampton Co. as most of the area is logged out, there is still a large standing area of some old growth and an area in which to hike. We were not 15 min. out from my truck on a trail and my nephew blurted out... ""Uncle Ron, look at this foot print!""  Off the trail a foot or two was a large print made in dried mud, (the last rain in the area was about 6 July 2003), so the print was well defined and clear as the photo shows. Several things I noticed about the print, 1) It was not a boot print as no boot tracks were showing, the print was smooth, consistent with a bare foot print. 2) The width was about 9 inches wide at the largest width, and about 14 inches long. 3) Toe contours could clearly be seen, but it looks like what ever made he print may have stepped on a twig, wood, so not all the toes made an imprint in the mud, as the casting shows. 4) The foot print clearly shows a heel print, and arch in the foot, the edge of the foot at wide proportions from a very heavy individual. 5) As the trail is used lightly by mountain bikers and horses, as seen by tracks on the trail. Our 5 hours up on the trail, I only saw one mountain biker that day while in the area. So, it is not used that much, maybe only by locals who live in Dallas or people who know the area. I attempted to make GPS readings that day, but for some reason, my GPS could not pick up satellite signals possibly from the heavy canopy of trees. Another attempt for a long/lat reading with negative results on a second trip. I will attempt a 3rd trip with new batteries and see what happens. The print was, as I said, left of the trail, going SSW. I searched the area for about 2 hours, hair samples on trees, scat, or other prints in area...negative results...photos of area were taken from different perspective points. At this point, as I dont want to ""contaminate"" the area with undue traffic, I will keep the exact location confidential until I complete my investigation.  Now a little history on the area. I have hunted the Falls City and Dallas area since 1970. In 1972, while heading to Falls City, Or. my friend Rick swerved to miss something darting across the road... I was a witness to something large, tall and running on two legs, not four....thinking it may have been a bear, or a crazed hunter dressed in black... we both, as teenagers could not answer what we saw... The stories we had heard is, that the Dallas and Falls City area from old timers, and hunter friends of ours, stories of BIGFOOT circulated during that time... especially after the famous RED BLUFF, Ca. film clip of the famous Roger Patterson... from 1967. As the photo shows I took a casting of the footprint, as mentioned, only one was found thus far. Within the next few days I will attempt to return to the area for further investigation and findings. Will keep you posted... You do have my permission to post this report and photos... At this point, ""undetermined what made the print"" At his point only two other Bigfoot Research Websites have been contacted on this sighting, no response as of yet.

I left Portland at 3 am and had only had coffee and donuts to eat; there were not many other cars on the road at all, none that were going in a westerly direction that were within sight of me and only about 2 cars passed me between Spirit Mountain Casino and the site were I had my sighting. I was driving about 55 mph and had my bright lights on  and had just came over a rise in the road shortly after you start down the back side of Murphy Hill summit. As I crested the rise out in the distance I saw what I thought at the time was a deer on the left shoulder of the road about 200 yards out from me.  I slowed down to 40 mph or so because I didn't want it to jump in front of me or if there were other deer in the area I might spook them into the road. As I got within 75 yards the object began to move across the road from left to right, that is, when I saw that it was not a deer and I thought it might be a bear which I have seen cross a road before but this was way different. The object was hunched over slightly and was on two legs and cleared the road in about 4 steps. The best way to describe the color was dark brown to black and I would guess the hair to be 4 or 5 inches. The arms looked to come down to mid thigh area. I did not see the face except for there seemed to be a deer-like shine coming from the face area. The height was about 7ft + as it disappeared over the edge of the road to the right. I was about 50 yards away by this time. I was starting to feel pretty weird like this was something I had never seen. Hard to explain the feeling as I passed the spot where it went over the bank I tried to look over and see where it had gone. I was going about 25 mph now as I went about 20 yards past the spot and stopped I then reversed my car to the spot where I had seen it go over the bank. I stopped my car and left the engine running I had my window rolled down slightly for air flow as I was driving. When I stopped I could smell a musty type smell not real bad but strong enough to notice. I could hear some movement in the brush but not a lot because of the car noise and the fact that my window was only down 2 or three inches on the left side when the object was now on my right.  I had a really strong feeling that I was being watched; every hair on my body was rigid, I had goose bumps over my whole body I have them now as I write about this, not as bad but the chills. I decided then that it would be a really good time to leave so I drove off as fast as my Metro would go I made it to Lincoln City at 6 am and had about 10 cars pass me going east on hwy 18 in that time.When I got there I went to my girlfriend's to get my bag and was going to come right back to Portland to work. Instead I stayed until 9 am then left to go back to Portland. As I drove by the spot I thought about stopping but decided against it.  I know the area well though because I helped a lady who had rolled her car off the road in the same are many years ago. The bank in the are is about 7 ft down on both sides and is swampy in some places. I lived in Lincoln City for many years and have spent time in the woods alone and with others and have never felt or seen anything like this  I don’t know what to make of it except for it being Bigfoot. No bear walks on its back legs like this. If you want to see the spot I can take you there just let me know also I drive this stretch of road 2 times sometimes more a week.",About 1/4 mile west of Murphy Hill summit in coast range on a long straightaway,Polk County,Oregon,Winter,Report 7537: Sasquatch crosses road in Coast Range in front of car,45.0608,-123.694,12/8/2003,7537,Class A,c200370f0v,47.04,44.665,42.29,42.33,0.95,0.78,0.49,0.0004,0.31,rain,1021.65,Foggy in the morning.,1,6.72,97,2.01
"My adult daughters where out camping the weekend of 10AUG2012  in a slightly remote camp in the Tillamook  forest. For 2 nights in a row they heard possible big foot calls that went on for 20min the first night and about 3 min the next night. I can assure you it was not any Elk, Deer, any of the owl species, That calls where  whoop call, and im told  extremely loud, This group totaled 6 that weekend that heard this series of calls. The following weekend this weekend friday 18AUG I myself and a friend from work and his daughter went to the very same camp to hear for ourselves and attempt to get recordings of the calls, long story short, I’m an experienced out doors man as an avid Bow hunter and fisherman I’ve spent countless hrs in the woods and have heard most of all the local animal calls. From all the known owl calls, to every possible combination of elk and deer calls to the death moan of a bear. I’ve been known to follow elk heads at night and just be in a good place to hunt them in the Am. Be that as it may On Friday the 18th I set out to this camp and waited for the arrival of my work friend and his daughter. After dinner we relaxed at the camp fire till about 9:00 p.m. and set out for a short hike to the power line rd and did some Knocking, with  no responses’ we returned to camp and was doing a little star gazing around the camp fire.  At 10:15 p.m. to our astonishment we heard in rapid succession a series of Knocks 1,2,3,4,5 pause then 1,2,3,4,5, coming from the SE 2 sets of about 5 of 6 knocks with a delay between sets of about  no more than 5 seconds. Within 10 seconds of the second set of knocks we had our recorder going hoping to capture more  knocks on tape when from the NE we heard a classic call back Howl in response 2  Howl calls in fact, We have captured those calls on tape. Being that our camp was in-between the calls my best estimate of distance or camp was from the calls where no more than a ¼ to a ½ of a mile as the crow fly’s with us between them, our camp that night was the only camp site taken in the whole camp ground. With the closest set of camp grounds approximately 6 miles away. In conclusion with my current back ground in Metrology and reporting my findings with an unbiased opinion using the return calls taped on your show that I’ve heard over time and applying them as a reference standard I must therefore conclude this as the genuine article and report this as very plausible given my own personal experience. All I need now is to personally see one and it push it over the top for me. As it stands right now I feel 85% certain that this phenomenon is real. I am no expert with regards to Bigfoot and would love to hear your thoughts on this matter and would very much enjoy putting you in contact with all involved and giving you the audio we recorded. I look forward to hearing back from you as I would very much like your thoughts on the recordings we have.",Oregon Hwy 6 West.,Tillamook County,Oregon,Summer,Report 36280: Campers hear knocks and unknown vocalizations at night in Tillamook State Forest,45.61308,-123.3973,8/18/2012,36280,Class B,c2072p8g6w,71.1,62.425,53.75,57.58,0.92,0.14,0.04,0,0,,1013.93,Mostly cloudy until afternoon.,6,10,333,0.35

"I was returning to my home in Kennewick, WA, after delivering Christmas gifts to relatives in southern Idaho.  It was early evening (around 5:45 pm), and I was driving in the westbound lanes of I-84.  I had encountered heavy, thick fog at the top of what is locally known as ""Cabbage Hill"".  It also began to snow.  The roadway was snow-covered and slick.  Traffic was moving quite slowly (20-30 mph).  Trucks were moving especially slow due to the steep roadway, poor visibility, and slick roads.  Traffic was backing up.  There were 5-6 vehicles, including mine, travelling as a group, with 2-3 in the left lane and 2-3 in the right. The westbound lanes make a sharp turn to the right, straighten, steepen their grade, go through a cut in the hillside, and make a turn to the left, crossing Patawa Creek.  This was in the vicinity of milemarker 222.  There is a guardrail alongside the exposed side of the westbound lanes when they are not protected by embankments. As we were driving on the straight section between the curves, I could see the brake lights of the vehicles in front of me come on - the red glow getting brighter.  I assumed we were either getting closer to the left turn and people were slowing, or there was some slower moving trucks ahead.  I was in the left lane, and slowing down, putting more space between me and the car in front.  Suddenly, I saw a large creature sitting/leaning on the pavement side of the guardrail - this would be to my left.  It appeared to be watching/waiting for traffic go by.  It's head turned from side to side, but I didn't notice detail.  I looked at it as I drove by, and noticed that it appeared to be covered by long hair, or a long fur-like coat, which was covered/streaked with snow.  It watched me drive by. At first I thought there must be an accident or stalled vehicle ahead (there were none behind me that I had passed), because why would someone be standing/sitting in that location, watching traffic?  I was puzzled by what I saw, and noticed there were no vehicles stalled/parked below the location, either.  The more I thought about it, the more I realized this was crazy.  Why would someone be there?  Except for the interstate, this spot is fairly isolated; farms/ranches are quite a long distance away.  The terrain is very steep and rugged.  The weather was quite cold, damp, inhospitable.  If this was a ""person"" stranded or seeking help, he/she/it did nothing to atract attention or to get someone to stop.  This was definitely not the time or place one would encounter someone out for a leisurely ""stretch of the legs"". I don't disbelieve in Sasquatch.  I know there will always be hoaxes, and logical explanations for things that seem unexplainable.  But I also know there are things yet to be ""discovered"", and new discoveries are made regularly.  The more I thought about this, the more I began to think that maybe I did see what my second reaction said I saw.  I called my wife on my cell to tell her.  She got a big kick/laugh out of my story, said something about maybe I've been driving too long and should take extra care in travelling the remaining distance to home.  When I got home, I retold my story to my family/friends.  That ""understanding"" smile has been the usual reaction.  But some have also said, ""Who knows?  Maybe you did see Sasquatch!"".  I finally convinced myself to report this to your site.  Maybe I'll discover I wasn't the only one to see something extraordinary that night.","Left lane of westbound lanes, near milemarker 222, before roadway goes through cut in rock and then crosses Patawa Creek, guardrail on left (downhill) side of left lane.

"I and my husband were at the local swimming hole, called Black Bridge. I was at the gravel watching over our two nieces who were wading around the water. The swimming hole is under a rail road bridge.  The footings are cement.  My husband walked around the cement, along the edge, to the back side. I walked the other way along the gravel where I found two indentations under the trees. The indentations looked like a sleeping place for a bear. But it was odd how they were so big and right in the open. Anyway, the girls were getting chilled and got out to dry in the summer sunshine. My husband came back about then, too. You should have seen the look on his face!  He had that stare of disbelief and his face was drained of color. I asked what it was, what was wrong. He said he was just about to walk along the path, into to trees... What was that? Someone whispering? He didn't think anything of it but felt uneasy. He heard two someone's whispering again. He stopped moving and they stopped moving. He'd start moving and so would they. He thought someone was just playing around but felt so uneasy. About the 4th or 5th time of this red light green light game, he for no reason got the heebie jeebies. He said something just was not right and he felt like high tailing. He remained calm, and just backed out to the water's edge where I turned to climb the cement back. Any way, he was just telling me about the whispering and that he thought they were saying ""Look, who is that? It's --- (my husband's name)."" Something... he wasn't sure, but he did make out his name. He was telling me the story when this huge limb comes flying out from back there and hits the water with a splash. We looked at each other and back to the limb, as it floats down river. No one could have possibly thrown that, I thought. We were just talking of checking it out when we heard this huge splash back there. There was this kind of grunt along with it. I figured we were interrupting the Big Man's meal gathering and we probably should leave. We said our apologies to whoever was back there and left tobacco as a courtesy and left.","Beginning at Pendleton, Oregon, go east on Mission Rd. to Cayuse Rd.  and continue for about 10 miles.

"November 2013 We live near the Umatilla River just 2-3 miles outside of Pendleton, OR on the Umatilla Indian Reservation.  It is not a remote area.  We are surrounded by farm ground and a couple neighbors within a couple thousand yards or so on a dirt road. We sleep with our bedroom window cracked about 2 inches open so the bedroom stays very cool. I awakened around 12:30AM and sat straight up in bed because I had heard something.  It was very quiet in the house and no unusual noise outside but I had heard ""something"" that woke me up wide awake. Listening intently for several minutes, I heard this weird and very loud wailing, screaming, laughing noise that sounded like a cross between a woman hysterically screaming and then quickly changing to hyena-like laughing and almost a ""wooping"" yell. I jumped out of bed and ran to the front door that opens to farmland and low rolling hills.  It sounded like several hundred yards out.  It repeated 3-4 times, each getting quickly farther away like it was running. I did not awaken my spouse. A couple weeks later, the same thing occurred late at night.  Then, a few days later around Christmas/New Years the local newspaper ran a story about ""Bigfoot"" scaring tribal members and people at night.

"While on a hike during this nice sunny day, I heard a low grumbling sound. My husband was leading me along the trail and he did not hear this sound. I stopped him and described the sound to him as a sort of ""wild boar"" type sound. It was VERY hard to describe. The sound was low, deep, like a vibrating growl or snort. We looked around and listened. When we didn't hear anything for quite a few minutes, we began walking again. Not more than 3 or 4 steps down the trail we hear a rustle noise and I quickly turned to see a rock or something rather large, dark and round fall to the ground with a large THUMP! The item had landed just where I was standing only a moment before. My husband heard this large item hit the ground and we stood stunned for a moment trying to figure out where it came from. I looked around the area and found a rock about the size of a baseball sitting where the item had hit the ground. My husband and I could NOT figure out where it had come from. Was a rock in the tree and it just now fell? Did something throw that rock at us? We were a bit jumpy but kept on down the trail. About 1/4 mile along the trail we hear a loud ""whomp, whomp"" like wood against wood sound ahead of us up on the hill. I asked my husband what that was and he decided it was probably just some people doing work on the trail. I didn't believe that's what it was. It sounded too heavy to be man made. Maybe machinery, but there was no motor sound and it was a Sunday evening. I doubt workers were on duty at this time and on this day. Just then we heard the sound move and we turned to hear the same wood on wood ""whomp"" noise behind us on the trail and still above us on the hill. My husband remarked, ""If that was bigfoot I don't know how he moved that quickly!"" I told him that we could rule out trail workers and that it was quite possible that it was TWO bigfoot communicating with each other. We joked about it, but we were both very shaken. We just could not come up with a more reasonable explanation for this sound. My husband describes this sound as a person hitting a tree quite hard with a large log. After yet another few minutes of looking around and hoping to see something, we walked along the trail without answers. After this we heard nothing more and came across several hikers on the last mile of the trail. Several hikers had dogs and we didn't hear any dogs going wild barking at anything unusual. My husband and I were going to stop some hikers to ask if they had heard anything, but we didn't want to look crazy or scare them away from the trail. Other than the rock being thrown at us we didn't feel as though we were in any kind of danger. When I got home I called my father who is quite familiar with forest animals and noises. He couldn't explain where the rock would have come from, but he believes that the wood on wood sound could possibly be deer or elk. I doubt that it was deer or elk just because the trail was so populated. They would have been spooked by the hikers and the dogs... besides, the ""whomp"" sound was SO heavy and SO loud that I can't imagine a deer making such a large sound. We didn't smell anything, we didn't see footprints...but I can't think of anything else that would explain these noises and the rock being thrown at us. I just really feel as though it could have been ""Bigfoot"".","McDonald-Dunn State forest, west on 99 north of Corvallis, near Peavy Arboretum.",Benton County,Oregon,Winter,"Report 10928: Hikers hear growl, wood  knocking, have rock thrown at them.",44.6693,-123.2433,3/13/2005,10928,Class B,9rbq5ebcwc,67.16,48.11,29.06,32.19,0.49,0,0.12,0,0,,1025.12,Clear throughout the day.,5,10,10,4.86
"My wife and I love to take our three young children on small treks (we usually hike 3-5 miles). We live very close to Silver Falls, but wanted to venture out a bit more. We read about Mary's Peak, just outside of Philomath and thought we'd give it a try. The following is what my wife wrote in her blog last night. Here is the link, where you can find some pictures of the area we hiked http://tleraadventures.blogspot.com/ Here's what she wrote: We were disappointed to find it incredibly foggy, since it is the highest point on the coastal range, and we had our hearts set on a spectacular view. As it turned out, the fog made the dense forest section of our hike even more interesting and gorgeous. All of the plants and trees were damp and dripping from the condensation, and the clouds were swirling around us at times- absolutely breathtaking! It was very secluded, and simply serene. About half way through our hike, we heard a UAS (Unidentified Animal Sound). The best way I can describe it is to say that it was a short, deep, guttural whooping sound. Whatever it was, was clearly rather too close for our liking. We weren't really frightened, but we were unnerved enough to take safety precautions. I stopped taking pictures, and Travis & I insisted that the kids walk between us in a tight group for the remainder of the hike. The sound came and went, and at one point it became clear that there were at least two of whatever-they-were, because we realized that not all of the sounds were coming from the same direction. They were alternating, as if they were communicating. It all continued for about 40 minutes, sometimes louder and closer, other times quieter, and obviously farther away as we continued to climb the trail. Eventually, the sounds ceased altogether, and we relaxed when we finally made it out of the forest section and back into the open.",Mary's Peak.

"I lived in Welches, Oregon.  I am 42 yr old now.  This was 2 1/2 years ago, in November 2003.  I was living in an apartment over a garage overlooking the Salmon River. At around 6pm there was a large bang on my front door. The door was locked, thank goodness.  I called 911 and told them that something banged on my door, and I was alone and scared.  I lived right next to the Mt. Hood National Forest.  No families lived there in the winter time.  If something happened to me no one would hear me scream.  I heard grunting.  I looked out onto my deck, through the windows and I saw those eyes.  It had to be huge animal. It was there watching me and I was watching it.  It blinked its eyes, but it was like the animal was frozen with its eyes set on me.  It had a furry head. It took 3 hours for the police to show up.  They came in on foot, from down the road, but did not see anything when they looked around.","Elk Park Road, Welches, Or 97067.",Clackamas County,Oregon,Winter,Report 14841: Possible approach to a property on the edge of the Salmon Huckleberry Wilderness,45.3207,-121.9547,2/15/2003,14841,Class B,c213bf7k1w,46.59,42.865,39.14,38.76,0.85,0.86,0.45,0.0242,1,rain,1008.48,"Rain until afternoon, starting again in the evening.",2,8.15,91,3.05
"I was at a friend's house in the Colton area. It was around midnight when I noticed strange noises in the treeline approx. 100 yards from his house. These noises were birdlike in nature and seemed to be coming from 3 places, directly in front of the house and off to both sides and further away. These noises sounded like birds but were only part of a bird call, and they seemed to be answering each other. There were 5 different noises and while they seemed birdlike they definitely came from something larger than a bird. At approx. 12:30 am I finally asked the other people at the house to come outside and listen. Everyone agreed that the noises were strange and like nothing they had ever heard before. We shined a flashlight in the area that noises seemed closest and saw nothing due to heavy brush, but the noises quit in that area until we stopped shining the light. These noises lasted until approx. a half an hour until dawn and quit quite suddenly. I grew up in the area and spend alot of time hunting and fishing and being in the outdoors, as does the property owner, we could not identify any local animal that makes these noises. In the morning we went and looked in the area closest to the house and found want could 2 possible tracks, they matched nothing we had ever seen, and we compared them with the other animal tracks in the area and they matched nothing, also noticed that the grass was pushed down in approx 3-4 foot strides running through the field behind the stream area where we found the possible tracks and where we thought some the noises were coming from. Since then the property owner has heard the same noises at night and last night heard something thrashing around in the brush. Also, if this has any bearing, there has been a good deal of logging in the area we thought that perhaps something has been pushed out of that area.

"13 Miles south of Glen Avon Bridge on the Molalla River in Oregon, my friend, myself and two large dogs jumped out of my truck to check up on a regular camp site we use throughout the summer. We walked only about 25 ft from the gravel road and a huge sound of bushes/trees crackling and breaking came from our left. I saw the disturbance out of the corner of my eye and when I looked over, I could see the brush moving violently about 10 ft beyond our path. I didn't see any thing but  there was an enormous two or three steps traveling away from us and I could feel the vibration of the weight of the steps under my own feet. That was no deer or elk, the pounding of steps was too heavy and there was a distinct - one step, then a broad second step hitting the ground.  I instantly knew that we had definitely startled something that was very big, very close and very fast. I have heard many human-like steps that seemed excessively heavy on more than one camping trip at the Molalla. They are always after all have gone into their tents or settled in for the night.

"Near the end of August, this year 2008 a couple of friends and I went camping/Bigfoot hunting around the upper Collawash River in the Oregon Cascade Range east of Estacada with the intensions of finding a spot I had been told about by a guide on a whitewater rafting trip I had taken with my brother in 2006. Unfortunately, when we got to our destination, I was the only one in our group that wanted to look for Bigfoot. Disappointed but not dissuaded, I tried to keep the rest of the group (2 guys and 1 girl) at least somewhat interested in the Bigfoot search, to little avail. The first night we camped (under much protest) quite a way into the bush and away from the overcrowded camp grounds where everyone felt more comfortable.  We followed an old logging road until it ended at a very secluded spot atop a ridge and maybe 250 to 350 yards directly south of the clear cut power line running east/west. The first night was interesting as we continued to hear distinct wood knocking; they started at around 11:00pm. Most were far off and very fast, 4 to 7 quick, sharp cracks directly east of us that would echo across the valley only to be answered from another direction farther south and then north but at first they were pretty far off. Everyone thought they were gunshots but this was a really dark night and these sounds were coming from pretty deep in the thick forest accessed only by not well traveled logging roads and from at least 3 different sources that for the life of me, sounded like they were communicating so I ruled out gunshots. These sounds continued to get closer to our campsite as the night wore on. At one point, maybe 12:30 or 1:00am the group wanted to drive over to the power lines, where the trees weren’t so thick and you could see for several miles, I decided to stay at camp and hope for something to happen. Almost immediately after everyone left, I started hearing sticks breaking from the direction they had driven out on and everything got real quiet. Now I’m from Montana and have spent many a night camped alone in far more rugged mountains than I was in now and have experienced most of the wildlife at least partially up close and personal that our American forests have to offer but I gotta tell you, I got a little spooked while they were gone! I did what any self respecting outdoors man would do and…put a lot more wood on the fire! I didn’t hear anything at that time that sounded too bizarre but I was glad when everyone got back. My buddy asked me if I was knocking rocks together while they were gone. I told him I hadn’t and asked what they heard. He said that they were out looking at the valley from the top of the road we came in on, about 250 to 350yards away and they all heard distinct knocking coming from the direction of our camp, he said it sounded like rock on rock. Later after everyone had gone to their tents I again decided to stay up. At around 3:30am I heard a very low grumble with a huff followed by what sounded like a lot of breath being pushed out and very close to the fire, maybe 30ft. At first I thought it was a bird or something, then, almost immediately another answered the first from across the clearing we were camped in directly behind me. I put my flashlight on where I heard the sound coming from and it would stop. 10 min later it would start up again. I don’t know why I didn’t get anyone up to listen with me but I didn’t. This went on for about an hour, until the sun started to brighten the sky and you could see a lot better. I never heard walking or anymore sticks breaking but those grunting noises were definitely close and there was at least 2 of whatever was making them. It wasn’t until on our way home that my buddy told me that he had heard the grunts too and, I love this, he was too scared to get up and investigate. The next day we went looking for another campground. I didn’t want to leave but I was definitely the minority on the subject. As we were driving down, I believe was FR43, my buddy and I in his rig and his friends behind us in theirs, something very big ran across the road about 150yrds in front of us. It was dark brown or black and uniform in color and at least 8ft to 9ft tall and moving like a freight train, it was huge! We only saw it for maybe a second before it tore into the trees running from the right to the left. My skeptical buddy looked at me and said “Did you see that!” I had my video camera in my lap but there was no way I could have gotten a shot of this thing, it was really moving! We stopped where we thought it crossed the road and you could see quite clearly where something had came down the incline on the right side of the road, we didn't smell anything. We got out and I climbed the small incline that it had come down to investigate and after 30 min or so found a barefoot track 18” long x 7½” wide and got video of it. I can send you the video and have other stories of the area as well. We did have material to cast the print but since it was in the mossy ground that covers most of the Oregon forest my buddy refused to cast the print claiming that we wouldn’t get anything from it. I was furious but it was his stuff and I learned the hard way to pack your own gear!",I am a little fuzzy as to the exact details but i do know that we took 224 through Estacada and continued east for at least another hour then ended up on I believe FR 43. Although after that we took the bagby hot springs road and several logging roads later found our first campsite at the end of one of these logging roads.,Clackamas County,Oregon,Summer,Report 24882: Four campers have nighttime visitation and then a visual observation of a sasquatch near Estacada,44.95023,-122.2347,8/10/2008,24882,Class A,9rcpdqzqj4,64.82,55.64,46.46,48.18,0.83,,0.31,0,0,,,Clear throughout the day.,0,,265,0.3
"On Monday, Aug. 25th at approximately 7:30 p.m. my friend and I were traveling westbound on Hwy 26 approaching Rhododendron.  We observed a car parked off the road in the east side emergency lane.  The car in front of us pulled off abruptly and we wondered if there was an accident or animal that had been hit by a car.  We proceeded slowly around the vehicle when an ""ape-like"" creature approx 6 ft. tall sprang from the woods.  It crossed the road behind us and was nearly hit by another westbound car.

"June 2004 For three days at dawn, I heard a long series of calls, the first of which lasted for about half an hour.  I was not fully awake for the first calling, and half awake, wondered if it was a screaming cow, being attacked or something. We have major preditors here, including a Mountain Lion. THIS WAS NOT A MOUNTAIN LION.  We've heard their screams, and this was nothing like that. Each dawn, the calls occured for a shorter and shorter duration. I was wide awake on the second and third dawns. On the third day at dusk, there was a brief series of calls.  It was the softest in volume.  Since then, I have heard nothing.  I live on one side of the Nehalem River valley, up a little on the ridge, and it sounded like the calls came from the opposite ridge which is very forested.  The calls sounded like a huge howler monkey, sort of a whoooop    whoooop   whooooop who's pitch went up at the ending.  As it progressed, the whooops got closer and closer together, until it was whooopwhoooopwhoooop, and then gradually faded out softly.  This sound reverberated across the entire valley, which is perhaps one mile from ridge to ridge.  I have lived in the woods of No Cal and Oregon, and heard many wild animals.  This was not a wolf, coyote, owl, elk, mountain lion, or the cows and donkeys that are a mile away.  This was much louder than the most emphatic sounds that these animals make.  A friend who has lived here, and on an Elk Preserve for many many years, heard the last dusk calling, and he said he had Never heard anything like it, and that Elk do not make that noise, nor are they that loud.

"On Friday morning, August 1, 2008 at about 2:35 AM, I was awakened from sleep in my rented 19 ft travel trailer to what initially sounded like a man yelling for his dog. My family and I were vacationing in Seaside, OR and we were staying at Circle Creek RV Park, located on Highway 101 about one mile south of the popular destination town. After being woken up, I listened for some time before getting up and asking my wife if she had heard what I was hearing. She had been sleeping with our two young sons at the opposite end of the trailer. What we both heard for the subsequent 25 minutes was a deeper voice calling, as if searching for someone. We could not make out what the person was saying, and it seemed odd to both of us that the vocalizations were exact replicas of each other, that is, each call sounded identical to the other. It was almost as if someone was walking around with a tape-recorded selection repeating plays in uneven short intervals. The vocalizations seemed to rapidly circle the RV park along a bordering creek and hedge-row. This movement of the sounds would have required the individual to be constantly running. My wife and I both observed out the windows in the trailer, looking for a flashlight or some other indication of someone searching. The security lighting in the RV park made it difficult to notice forms outside the perimeter. The tone and timbre, and completely unintelligible nature of the vocalization seemed similar to the ""samurai chatter"" recordings on the BFRO website. At one point the vocalizations became so close to our trailer and so loud that my wife became profoundly afraid. I began wondering if any of the other guests in the park had been awakened, and if they were shaken up as we were. At about 3 AM a car drove up from the highway and three passengers with flashlights exited the vehicle, and proceeded to their campsite. The car drove away. This activity brought silence to our unintelligible visitor, and we were not disturbed for the rest of the night. At 7 AM I asked the RV park manager if he had heard “all of the commotion” the previous night, and he said that he had not heard a thing. I was disappointed to be heading back to Portland that day, as I had hoped to talk with other park guests about the incident.","West on 26 out of Portland, north on 101, 3 miles, west side of highway.",Clatsop County,Oregon,Summer,Report 24328: Possible vocalizations heard at a campground near Seaside,46.03193,-123.4573,8/1/2008,24328,Class B,c20jyev5km,62.43,57.23,52.03,52.97,0.85,0.91,0.02,0.0019,0.71,rain,1014.92,Mostly cloudy throughout the day.,4,8.54,224,1.82
"On the morning of August 6th, at approximately 6:30am, at a location off Dutch Canyon road in Scappoose, while pre-season scouting, I was observing several deer, 4 bucks and 2 does. While watching the deer for approximately 15 minutes, I watched all six deer look towards the east into a tree line about 1000 meters from my location and the location of the deer. Within 30 seconds of watching the deer look over a bellowing scream came out of the wood line.  I knew exactly what it was from my prior reports from the Salmonberry area. In was on queue with the Ohio recordings.  The scream started at a low tone and progressively and increasingly became louder until it became a loud type of moaning growl. The deer at that point became intensely agitated, their tails went up and they took off heading west into an adjacent tree line about 300 meters from my location.  They did not stop for anything or anybody.  At that time, I focused my binoculars on the tree line that the scream came from and waited, and observed for almost 2 hours with no physical sighting.

"I entered this part of the Coos County Forest at its western edge, looking for possible hiking trails that I could follow to the top of the hills. I walked east along an old dirt logging road but it ended at the edge of a steep creek. The brush was very thick and I couldn't get through so I followed the creek in a southerly direction, walking through the ""slash"" (all the debris left over from clear cutting.) Actually, stumbling is a more apt description of my mode of travel. If you've been in a clear cut you know what I mean. Anyhow, I came upon a small spot of soft dirt next to a trunk and saw a footprint about an inch deep. It was a bare foot and just slightly bigger than my male size 10 1/2 in combat boots. I could plainly see the toes. I couldn't imagine how anyone could walk barefooted in that area.  I found I couldn't get where I wanted to go due to some wicked stickers so I left. I kept thinking about that print and decided to go back with a camera. Unfortunately, it rained for about 4 days. When it cleared up, I went back and stumbled around some more but it was washed pretty clean. However, I found some other prints that were bigger than the original, and some impressions that were smaller than my own foot (a youngster?). I tried taking pictures and can send them, but they aren't very clear. I could sort of see the track they took and I figured the stride to be about 6 feet between prints. The next day I entered the forest from the north. I followed a dirt road that led to another clearcut. From a high point I could see the area I had been in the day before, so I was sort of north-east of the original spot on the other side of the creek. I saw a beautiful deer and a snake there and found some more impressions. They appeared to be about 15 inches long with the same 6 foot stride. They were not well defined as the ground was hard and may have been made before the rain. I'm not a tracker, but I stood at the print and looked in the direction of travel and could see what appeared to be a trail. That's how I figured the stride. 2 of my strides=6 feet.

"Late Oct 2004. I was picking Matsutaki mushrooms near Storm Ranch in Coos County. I noticed free range cattle acting spooked so I kept my path moving in a clock wise motion. Periodically the cattle would sound off, but always behind me, roughly at my 7 o'clock. This happened for around 3 hours and when I decided to call it a night and hiked out to the road. When I got there I heard the cattle again. This time a huge bi- pedal animal ran up the side of the road directly at me. It was 7+ feet tall, huge shoulders, covered in reddish blonde, brown hair, no neck, pointed head, long arms and shorter legs. I could hear the bare feet slapping the road surface as it ran. I was frozen with fear. This thing came within 100 feet of me and stopped. I could see its breath as it stood there breathing heavily.

"Today is June 12 2005.My husband and I were around Lake Jefferson north of Suttle Lake out fishing and scouting elk. When we stopped to follow fresh bear and elk tracks. We could smell something very bad in the air and thought we were very close to a bear. A large bear. We came across a large stump that had some kind of hair all over it. We studied this for some time trying to figure out what had happened there as the stump had hair all over it and it was also all over the ground. We brought some home with us because it was the strangest fur we had ever felt. This fur was white and very coarse.It was not elk or deer or any fur we knew of. We looked on the ground and notice a set of elk horns that had been dropped. We continued down what looked like a game trail and found a wallow. In it were several foot prints from what looked like elk and bear. Also we saw foot prints that were at least 18 inches long and as wide as my foot.(I wear a 6 1/2).   shoe.) We followed the tracks and they headed toward a creek. The prints were easy to follow as the ground was clean where they stepped but surrounded with what looked like splashing from wet fur around each print. We investigated further, though I was scared to death, and had noticed the bushes and tree branches had been splashed as well with the muddy water from the wallow. There were tracks every where.   What ever made the prints was very heavy. The tracks were deep. My husband who weighs 230 lbs. tried to make prints that deep by jumping next to some and barely dented the ground. My husband, who was a logger and is very familiar with the wilderness had never seen anything like it before and was also astonished. He was curious and wanted to keep investigating but I was so frightened I just wanted to get back in the truck. To the best of our reasoning we figure the tracks were a day old. It had rained on Friday and they had dried enough for us to see them on Sunday afternoon.  We usually carry our video camera with us when we go out in the woods but forgot it on this trip. If it doesn’t rain this week my husband is going to go back and film it, he wants to gather more evidence of what is there. I don’t know if I can go back.  It may not sound like much in the telling of this story, but in real life you could just feel that something very large and strange lives there and we should not be in this place.

"I was walking in the woods behind my house in Lookingglass, near the Callahan Mountains during the late afternoon/evening. I was enjoying the late summer weather by taking a walk when suddenly I heard something stir in the brush several yards ahead of me. I walked silently for a few yards, daring not to get too close. More rustling. It was moving away now.... and then out of nowhere it appeared ahead of me. I don't think I have ever seen any bipedal thing that tall.... and hairy. Of course I wasn't right next to it... with the animal being about 20 yards away. I was twelve at the time, but I know what I saw.

As I rounded a curve in the road, I saw what I thought was a deer way up ahead crossing the road. I slowed down a bit as I got to where I thought the deer would be. What I saw was a figure standing just off the road by a fence with one hand on the fencepost and it turned as I went by, watching me. I thought It was a man so I stopped to see if he needed help. I got out of my truck with my flashlight in hand and started walking back toward the ""man"". I was working the lightbeam along the fenceline when I heard the most godawful sound I've ever heard in my life! I froze. I was in the military and I work as a psychiatric nurse and I don't scare easily but that scream scared the crap out of me. It sounded like a dying calf in a hail storm..It was ranging in tone, starting out high pitched, then ending up as a threatening, low pitched, guttural sound. I dropped my flashlight and RAN back to my truck and spun tires getting out of there. The next day on my way to work, I stopped at the same spot. My flashlight was still there. I didn't notice any footprints but did see the tall grass had been walked through on the other side of the fence. I looked on all the fence posts in the area where I saw it but did not see any evidence of hair. As to what it looked like, I only got a brief look as I went by, but it had to be at least 7 foot tall. I base this on the fact that I drive a Dodge Ram truck; when I'm sitting in the driver's seat, my head is 6 feet off the ground. The spot where this thing stood is in a depression in the ground. When I park my truck in that spot and stand where it stood, I can't see into the cab at all. And yet, that night I saw it, its head was even with mine, I was looking directly out the window not slightly up or down. I couldn't make out features as it was dark but the lights of my pickup slightly illuminated the area where it stood as I went by. As I said, I thought it was a man at first who needed help. It looked so human at that moment, it wasn't until later that I came to believe it couldn't have been a man. No man could have made that sound. What I remember seeing was a figure standing next to the fence. Its head followed me as I went by. It didn't appear to have shoulders, it looked like the head just spread out until it became shoulders. It appeared to have long hair all over; at first I thought it was a long jacket like a duster, but as I look back it had to be fur. But it was the scream that stands out in my mind. It was like a warning, ""don't come closer"", at least that was the message I got!","It had just crossed the hwy and was standing on the south side of hwy 138 east, about 15 miles east of Roseburg, about 4 miles west of Glide, Or",Douglas County,Oregon,Winter,"Report 8227: Driver stops, approaches bigfoot on foot around midnight on Hwy 138, 4 miles W of Glide",43.3029,-123.1611,10/15/2002,8227,Class A,9r8qm7hcdm,82.68,63.58,44.48,32.29,0.32,0,0.33,,,rain,1015.16,Clear throughout the day.,4,9.91,11,0.5
"On Saturday about 5:45 AM my hunting partner and I were walking down a gravel road and heard a loud scream from up hill above us. The scream started in a high pitch and went into more of a gruntal growl and echoed through the canyon. After a brief discussion I told my friend that it sounded like something was mad that we were out there and wanted to scare everything in the canyon. The next day at approx. 8:00 pm. we were hunting high above the canyon on the next ridge. I was the first back to the pickup and sat down about 30 yds. away to watch for elk. Suddenly i heard something coming down the hill through the burned trees. it sounded like another hunter, only it was being very loud. I stood up to try and see what it was but the wind picked up and blew my scent toward it. The sound stopped for a few seconds and it turned and ran back up the hill. I ran out the road to try and see what it was. By this time it had reached the top and was running upright along the ridge. I caught three or four glimpses through the burned trees before it went over the ridge. About 10 seconds later I heard two loud screams like before. My friend called me on the radio to ask if I heard it and to tell me he was heading in. I walked further out the road to meet him. As we were talking about it, we heard it once more. The thing I saw was walking upright, about six ft. tall and looked like a man with no neck in a ghilli suit.",The first sounding was in the Warm Spring Creek area off NFD 600.

"My brother and I went camping in the area between Glide and Diamond Lake on Highway 138. We pulled into a forest Service campground named Eagle Rock and found we were the only ones in the campground. The campground is situated right alongside what I believe is the Umpqua River. There are steep mountains on both sides so I guess you would say we were at the bottom of a canyon. The water was running over a lot of rocks next to our site and made a lot of noise. My brother decided to pitch his tent next to the river and I slept in my van in the parking spot. As darkness fell, we sat out in the dark talking about our lives. This was the first time we had been together in about 20 years so we had a lot of stories to tell. While we were was talking,I heard something making a weird calling noise from the mountain across the river from us. I wasn't sure until I heard it a second time. Since my brother was talking at the time, he didn't hear it. We eventually headed off to our respective beds. My brother woke up at 0200. He said he was checking his watch fo the time when he heard 2 loud hoots from across the river about 50-100 yards downstream. He called them hoots but said it wasn't really a hoot. He couldn't really describe or imitate the sound. They had to be very loud to be heard over the noise of the river. He laid frozen in his sleeping bag then heard something walking around the campsite. About that time something woke me up. I heard something moving around outside the van and was about to raise the windowshade to peek out when I heard what sounded like a gorilla grunting next to my van. I have no real experience with gorillas and have only heard them on nature shows on TV, but that's what I heard. Needless to say I was too afraid to lift the shade at that point. After a while, it got quiet (except for the river noise) and somehow we both fell back asleep. When it finally got light we came out, compared notes and started looking for any tracks. The ground was too hard and the river too rocky to show us any. I also checked the campground to see if there were any other campers there, but there were none. We don't think it could have been deer or elk because it was right in the middle of hunting season and hunters are all over the place up there. I don't think any deer or elk would come into a human camp at that time of year. When we got home we listened to the recordings on the site. The calls I heard were similar to those on the site, and my brother thought what he heard sounded similar.",Eagle Rock Campground.

"It was late at night.  We had a St. Bernard that loved to take long drives.  We decided to take a drive in the Pocono Mountains of PA. We would take familiar roads, then usually find a woodsy road to cut off on.  That night, I believe we were in the Bushkill Falls area (which should be in Monroe County).  We were on a narrow two-lane road in a heavily wooded area.  We approached an intersection with no stop signs.  We actually stopped to look at a map.  All of a sudden, a very tall figure crossed right in front of our car.  We were shocked!  It must have been at least 7ft.+ tall, long arms, hairy body, ape-like appearance, very slender.  It walked completely upright and just crossed over to the other side of the road.  There was another car that approached this small intersection--that car also saw it, because he stopped the car--remember, this was a back road with no stop sign.  Shortly after we had seen this creature, there was an article in the local newspaper about sightings in the state of PA.  I cut out the article and saved it, placing it in a book for safe keeping.  After awhile, we moved and the book with the article disappeared.

"On the morning noted a neighborhood man was driving down Pilottown Road around 4-5 in the morning when he came across large human-like footprints crossing the road and heading into a field/wooded area. I was almost 17 and when I woke up later that morning several neighbors were inspecting the tracks which came from a field behind my house, through my yard, across Cookslanding Road, into my neighbors yard, over a fence into a wooded area, across Pilottown Road and into the field/wooded area. The direction of travel appeared to be south east toward the Susquehanna River hills. Whatever made the tracks did take the time to inspect my rabbit hutch and my neighbors as well, though leaving them undisturbed. it also seemed to have walked around my neighbor's house, leaving 1 very good print protected by the overhang of the roof. The rest were partially filled with snow, but still unsettling due to their size and shape. The tracks were about 16"" long, 8.5"" wide, and 2"" deep in the snow, and had a stride of about 4 feet. I am including a tracing I took of the well preserved track I found. It may seem a very incredible way of preserving the footprint, but it was the only thing I could think to do to preserve it. I traced over it EXACTLY as it appeared in the snow. To this day nobody knows what made the tracks. My neighbor and several other people of the neighborhood are avid hunters and outdoorsman. They didn't know what to make of them. I am not saying this is sasquatch, but here is the 'tracing':",The area lies very close to the river hills of the Susquehanna where there is alot of cover and not alot of people.,Lancaster County,Pennsylvania,Winter,Report 28777: Memory of finding tracks in snow and the attempt to keep a record south of Quarryville,39.72785,-76.2074,7/20/2011,28777,Class B,dr1f1b5rwb,90.31,82.56,74.81,72.7,0.82,0.12,0.67,0,0,,1010.98,Humid throughout the day and partly cloudy in the afternoon.,8,5.65,154,0.49
"I have debated whether or not to report my encounter to the BFRO or any organization. I don't know why, but I guess I wanted to keep this experience to myself for a few years and then it just didn't seem to matter as far as reporting it. But now, I realize that all encounters need to be in a data base somewhere. These DO exist and when that day of discovery happens, this database will house many of the answers.  My encounter happened in early June of 2010. I took a friend to the Marienville/Timberline ATV trails northeast of Marienville, Pennsylvania in the Allegheny National Forest, to ride ATV’s for the day. Allegheny National Forest covers approximately 515,000 acres or 800 square miles of protected wilderness in North West Pa. The forest is pretty dense in most spots and has many types of terrain. From my understanding the Allegheny National Forest is one of the least densely populated areas east of the Mississippi River. Surrounding the Forest are more woodlands and farm country. The 2 trail systems we were riding that weekend join together and make an approximate 60-80 mile loop from the northern end down to the bottom, and then back up the other side of the loop. My encounter happened on our return back up, heading North. I remember it rained very hard the night before and through the early morning because my friend, who was new to ATV'ing, didn't bring rain gear. We had to go into town to buy him some cheap rain gear and then headed up to the trail. It rained the first half hour or so of our ride and I remember the sun coming out and it was turning into a really nice day for a ride. For those that ride ATV’s, they know that the rain makes mud, which is much more fun to ride in than dust. A few hours into the ride, having stopped and observed some beaver dams, some very old oil wells, a couple logged out areas where you could see for what seemed like miles and other cool sites that the forest has to offer, I was getting in more of a hurry to get back - it was approaching the end of the day. My buddy was way behind me so I decided to stop on the trail and wait for him. I usually don't separate from atv buddies when riding, but this part of the trail was an abandoned logging trail and pretty easy so I rode ahead awhile and then decided to stop and wait for him. He didn’t ride fast or dangerous; he ""putted"" so I knew he was safe, just slow. If he didn't shown up I would turn around and meet up with him. I wasn’t sitting long. I just took my helmet off. That’s when I noticed rocks kept hitting the front right side of my ATV. They weren’t large rocks, maybe about or just smaller than hand sized. It took a minute or so before it occurred to me that I was stopped and that rocks should not be flying through the air and hitting my atv. I was turning my head towards the right to follow the path of these ""air rocks"" as I called them, when my turn stopped. I noticed this “Stump” which turned out to be a dark figure, approximately 70-90 feet away, that appeared to be in a sitting or crouching, or just a low position, then stand up into an upright position. I’ll never forget how it seemed to pop right up like it was on a spring, with very little effort. Initially I looked at its hands because I was interested to see what was in its hand, if anything. It was much taller than a normal human – best guess at this point would be 7.5 feet or so, and absolutely NOT a bear. It was VERY broad at the shoulders. Almost freakishly broad – I remember that very well. It was on 2 legs and I could see its right arm hanging down, which was on the left side because it was facing me. I remember wanting to watch its right hand to see if “it” was armed or what it might be doing. That is funny to me now, because for some reason I assumed it was right handed. It moved its right arm to a slightly bent position, stopping with its hand in front of it, at about its waist. Its left arm stayed hanging to its side – very long arms.  It was all very dark black – a shiny black – from head to toe, or as far as I could see to its feet as it was standing in 1-2 foot tall grass or taller. As my eyes made their way up on the creature I could see its head was all black as well. There was no white or lighter color that stood out, like most animals would have on their face. I could not see clear details of the face as it was all black as well but it did not appear to have hair on all of its face. It appeared to be black skin - the same color black as its hair but I could tell it wasn't hair in some spots. I noticed that the eyes were black, or very dark and deep, with a pronounced brow ridge. I could obviously tell it had a face. I just couldn’t see defined detail of the lips or anything as it was all the same color. The lips were closed though and in a straight line across its face, not open mouthed or smile or frown – just straight lips. The hair was short to medium length and not shaggy. I’d say the hair was an average of 3 to 5 inches long, shorter at the head.  It was almost groomed in appearance but I think it’s from the hair being short and thick. At least that was my impression. Oddly, I did not notice any mud or dirt all over it, which seemed odd because it had rained hard the night before and didn't stop until several hours before this. The trails were muddy. Almost as soon as my eyes were at its head and face and I was trying to “zoom in” and get a better look at the face, it began to leave. It didn’t turn and walk away, but rather it stepped straight backwards into the brush and the trees and not take its eyes away from me. It stayed square to me as it was moving backwards. This all happened in the span of no more than 30 seconds, from the time I noticed the rocks hitting my ATV, up until it moved backwards. When I play it over and over in my mind, it seems more like 30 minutes. At this point an overwhelming fear just filled my mind, and I remember feeling like I shouldn’t be in this spot right now. I don’t remember shaking in fear or anything like that, but I felt warm and almost like I was going to puke. So I hit the gas and took off.  I wish now that I wouldn’t have just fled, but the feeling that came over me was not like I’d experienced before. I had my smart phone/camera in my fender bag and it NEVER occurred to me to get it out and start video. I honestly couldn’t move for a short period of time.  I have been surprised by people walking up on me in the woods and have hunted all my life, so animal encounters, even bear from a distance - do not scare or alarm me. I was in the military for 6 years, and actually had the honor to serve as SEAL TEAM 4 and SDV TEAM 2 (the old UDT TEAM 2) support, as part of a special warfare boat crew. During that time, I had many highly anxious experiences as one could imagine. To summarize, I am pretty observant, I don’t have a tendency to over-react and I don’t scare easy. I am very level headed and definitely not crazy. I didn't instantly think ""Bigfoot"" as I wasn’t a REAL believer then. At least I doubted their existence in the Eastern US and if they existed it was only in the Northwest US, Canada or Alaska.  This encounter took my emotions to places they had not been or at least had not been for a long time. It has been going through my head for over 4 years. I didn't tell anybody except my fiancée within the first year after the encounter. Now - quite a few people know. The person I was riding with that day just found out in 2014. I never told him about the story before, but because I couldn’t remember if it was springtime/early summer or late summer/Fall when this happened. I asked him what week if he remembered. When he told me it was springtime / early summer, he naturally asked why – what’s up? I told him what happened. It turns out that he believes in these creatures too. He then realized why I was acting so weird when we finally caught back up with each other, and then on the 2 and a half hour truck ride home. Now I wish I would have told him then. Maybe we could have joined together and gone back to look for signs or whatever we could find. Instead, the overwhelming feeling of “What the heck was that”, and “I can’t tell anybody-they won’t believe me anyways” took over, and I kept it to myself.  Nobody has to tell me what I saw or didn't see. I knew what I saw. I saw a large dark figure with hair that could throw rocks (and very accurately), stand up within 100 feet from me, in a large dense forest where there aren't any cabins or people just hanging out.  I still do leave the option open for an extremely large man (larger than anyone I have ever met) in a heavily padded Gillie suit with hair on it standing about 100 foot from the trail just waiting for someone to stop in that exact spot so he could throw rocks at him and take a chance of getting shot (most folks on ATVs will pack a handgun when riding in deep woods. At least that's my experience). Now that’s being sarcastic, but trying to make a truth out of what happened. Of course that option is slim, but it will always be there as I didn't walk up to this thing and shake its hand or hug it, so being 100% sure it was a Sasquatch just isn't possible. I am at 99.999% sure though. I do know that a fear like I’ve not felt in a long time, if ever, took over me for awhile. Something told me to go, to move on, that I shouldn't be here right now. Again - I am a very rational person and this just didn't make sense to me at all. I eventually plan on returning to that general area, on ATV and parking the bike and doing some walking. I just need to look around and feel comfortable with that. Ever since my encounter, I cannot put this down. I’ve been researching since and came across various online groups that discuss encounters. I want to learn as much as I can before returning and looking around and I want to go armed with more knowledge than I have now. UPDATE: I have returned to this trail (5 1/2 years later) and found the area this happened. It was strange being there.  Some of my biggest questions since learning more about these creatures are “What was it doing there, close to used ATV trails” and “Why did it draw my attention to itself?” If it hadn’t thrown rocks I would not have looked and if it hadn’t stood up, I probably wouldn’t have even noticed it. Someone told me that maybe it was travelling and recently crossed that trail. The reason for rock throwing and drawing attention to IT was possibly to draw attention to it on purpose so my attention wouldn’t go to something else nearby less able to protect itself. I interpret that as young ones. That NEVER crossed my mind. Just to realize that one was in the area blew my mind away and made me start thinking differently about what could be out there. Now, there may have been more? I’ll never know that for sure, but it does make sense to that question that’s been bugging me. I now wonder if there were young close to me, maybe they were throwing the rocks being mischievous. It is still hard for me to grasp that anything could throw rocks from approximately 90 feet away and hit the same general area – very, very accurate. If it wanted to harm me, it would have beaned me in the head and I wouldn’t be writing this encounter.  I've since been researching an area about 25 miles west of this location. I went from not caring or thinking about Sasquatch to a full blown enthusiast. I attend conferences and have actually received an invitation to Beachfoot in Oregon in 2016.  For this years Ohio Bigfoot conference, Sybilla Irwin (a BFRO member and artist) is doing a drawing of what I've described to her, and will be unveiling it at the conference. All of this is exciting, and I cannot wait to see her bring this back to life, and return my emotions back to that 1 minute of my life that changed how I think now. I cannot attach that picture yet as the Ohio Bigfoot conference director has asked not to put it out there until after the conference. But if you would like, I could come back to this and attach the drawing, which will be as close to what I saw as possible. also - for more info on this, The guys from Monster X internet radio contacted me and asked if I would come on their show. They saw my encounter on a group. I agreed and did a 2 hour show with them, discussing this event. Google MONSTER X Dave Groves. I am not looking for any type of notoriety out of this. It's why I haven't put up a report. But they found me and asked, so I agreed. I feel that folks need to know about this and that these creatures DO exist Anybody who knows me will tell you I am a very honest person. It is one of my strong qualities.  I know there are many made up hoax bigfoot stories out there, but I can assure you that this is NOT one of them. I wasn't out looking for a bigfoot that day. I did not ask for this encounter to happen. But it did, and it changed many things about me. I stopped hunting deer and have not hunted since that day. I now cannot put Bigfoot stuff down and even started a bigfoot book collection with some very old and hard to find, autographed bigfoot books. This doesn't happen to a person overnight, unless something occurred to change them. That day certainly did change me.",Directions withheld at the request of the witness.,Forest County,Pennsylvania,Summer,"Report 51283: ATV rider has broad daylight encounter, rocks thrown near Marienville",41.51954,-78.87955,6/5/2010,51283,Class A,dprujn3sv7,77.54,71.005,64.47,64.39,0.88,0.77,0.77,0.001,0.64,rain,1007.28,Rain overnight.,8,7.46,231,4.6

"These incidents have occurred over a period of approximately 7 years. The occurrences have not been limited to a particular time of year. I have never, nor has any in our group, sighted a creature. Most have experienced hearing knocks, LOUD branch breaks, hearing bi-pedal footsteps emanating from a creature much larger than a human would make, smelled noxious odors, and had that inexplicable feeling of being watched. The place is a cabin which has been in my son-in-law’s family for 4 generations. It is located on the edge of the Allegheny National Forest, off the summit of a mountain. Across the lane from the cabin is a large meadow, belonging to a local doctor. This is sometimes planted in grain crops, other times allowed to remain fallow. There are other cabins scattered along the lane; none within eye-sight of the other. My first trip was in October of 2006. There was no other activity at the other camps. My son-in-law (Eric) and I arrived about 8-8:30 at night in the darkness. Upon exiting the Jeep, I had an immediate feeling of being watched. I have spent a good deal of time in the woods, hunting, fishing, and hiking. I am not easily spooked.  After dinner, cleaning up, and sitting up a bit talking we turned in about midnight. Around 2 A.M. I was awakened by the sound of the old wooden table and chairs being pushed about on the deck. We determined it must be a bear, and went back to sleep. Approximately 2 hours later we heard something rustling about the fire pit. We did NOT cook any food outdoors, we brought in all our empty bottles and such when we came in to discourage bears and other critters. In the morning, we found the table and chairs had been moved about, which a bear or even a large raccoon could have done. However, the fire pit had been scattered about, some of the smoldering logs rolled aside. Another time, we were hunting in the forest behind the cabin. The topography is typical Appalachian mountain; rugged, steep slopes, ravines, small streams and bogs. Here and there are small oil seeps as well. We had just descended into a fairly open area which promised grouse. This was early November, crisp but not cold. We were each carrying shotguns loaded with upland game shells. We were walking approximately 50 yards apart when we stopped, looked at one another and asked “What is that smell?” From out of no-where came the most putrid, overpowering smell. It was not the oil-seeps, which have their own sulfur like smell. This was horrid! It was like a skunk on steroids, with a good measure of open septic tank, and some rotten garbage added for good measure.  We continued on our way, the smell dissipated after about 100 feet.  We tried to tell one another it was a dead deer or something; but we both knew better. I worked in a funeral home while in college; and have never experienced anything that nauseating.   We also had an unnerving feeling of being watched the entire time we were there. Upon relating the above to my daughter, Eric’s wife, she stated she has smelled awful odors for no apparent reason as well and felt like she was being watched several times. We have heard howls, far in the distance, and others within a quarter mile  or so of the cabin. There are coyotes in the area, yet these are much longer in duration, and have more range. Some start low, and rise toward nearly a falsetto pitch. Others have been more monotone yet will waver somewhat. Others will start low, and culminate in a scream. This is not a bob-cat, not a coyote, and all members of our party are accounted for. In March of 2014, a group of us went for Spring Opening. There were 5 of us there. As darkness set in, I decided to venture out to the open meadow to observe the Winter constellations. This is about 100 yards from the cabin. The cabin is situated on the downward slope from the summit, which is the meadow. The area behind and on both sides of the cabin is a fairly steep slope. It is heavily grown with second growth trees, brush, and scrub. There are also a lot of blow-down branches which makes walking even in daylight difficult. At night, it is an invitation for a sprained ankle at best. As I was observing the stars and enjoying the silence, I heard footsteps. Not in the trail, not in the meadow, but coming UP the slope to the south of the cabin. My initial thought was a bear. As I listened, it was apparent the foot falls were from a biped. I called out if it was any of our group and received no reply. Then the steps would start again. I called again, louder, and the steps stopped for a moment.  Then, they began again, finally stopping by the edge of the lane. There were no lights showing, the moon was in the final phase of its final quarter, and just a sliver. I started to return to the cabin. I was about 20 yards from where I heard the steps stop along the edge of the lane. As I drew parallel to that area, I heard shuffling of the underbrush, as if whatever it was had turned it’s entire body sideways to watch me pass. When I entered the cabin, everyone was where I had left them. There were no new leafs, mud or debris in the doorway. When I asked if they heard anything, they all said no, as they were watching Planes, Trains and Automobiles on VHS. Finally, this past Spring, a group of us went up for a weekend. While sitting about the rear deck, enjoying a fire and talking, a member of our party was encouraged to do their howl. They did. Then about 30 seconds later, the sound of a very large tree limb snapping came from down the slope behind the cabin. Could it have been a bear stepping on a branch? Perhaps, but that would be very coincidental to step on a limb just after a howl. I KNOW there is something in those mountains. I can’t prove it physically; it one of those things that you know that you know. Please keep this location undisclosed. We would hate to see a bunch of people go hunting for these creatures. They don’t deserve to be pursued and bothered. I have been needing to share this with someone who won't think I am off my rocker.

"Hello, I am from Koppel Pa, Beaver County. I have miles and miles of strip mines and mushroom mines all around my house. [Editor's Note: ""Mushroom mines"" are underground coal mines that were converted into subterranean farms for growing mushrooms. Mushrooms grew very well in these tunnels because the air temperature and humidity remained very stable and consistent throughout the seasons. Modern methods for stabilizing air temperature and humidity have made mushroom mines mostly obsolete, so most of these tunnels have been abandoned]. I was in the strip mines by the Wampum mushroom mines and heard a loud groaning sound. We (my buddy and I) went to make sure no one was hurt and we saw a large framed figure all a dirty brown color. I, thinking it was a brown bear, yelled very loud to spook it and make it run, but the large figure turned and looked us in the eyes and ran. I never believed in ""Bigfoot"" but this is hard to ignore. It stood about 6' plus. Very thick build kind of like a heavy weight boxer. The hair was medium in length, dirty brown. (closley resembled to a brown bear). The figure was not very threatenig but instead just ran off into the mines. We looked for it for about an hour or so but didn't see it again.",It was about 1/8 mile from the Wampum Mushroom mines.

"It was about 430 am and I had just settled into my treestand for a day of hunting.  It was extremely quiet which was the first thing that I noticed.  It was going on about 500 when I heard what sounded like a log being hit with another log.  I brushed it off as something going on up at the new construction site on top of the hill.  About 520 am I heard something walking back and to my left toward the top of the hill I was sitting on.  I was about 1/4 of the way up the hill and this was near the top where I heard it.  I knew the walking was bipedal and at this point in time I got very angry about somebody tresspassing and ruining my day of deer hunting. As the noise got closer the sun was just up enough I could skyline this huge ""man"" walking across the top of the ridge.  I looked at him through my binos and well it wasn't any man.  I know this bigfoot had to be 7' 5"" tall and at least 650 lbs.  He was dark brown or black in color unable to tell exactly due to lighting issues.  I wasn't able to make out facial features.

"My name is Amanda and I live in Plum, Pennsylvania.  On july 23rd, I was sitting out side talking to my boyfriend of nine months, Tommy.  I heard some moving in the woods beside our house, but disregarded it as a wolf or a bear or something like that.  I continued talking to tommy for about another 20 minutes when i smelled something strange and happened to look up and see a figure in the middle of our field that appeared to be about 8 or 9 feet tall.  It was very large and was covered in dark brown to black hair from head to foot.  It's face was part human, part...something else.  I jumped up in fear, ran into my house and immediately locked the doors and shut the blinds.  My family was wondering what was wrong with me, they all said that i was ""as pale as a ghost"".   My mom went out and shone a flashlight around, we saw nothing else that night.  The next morning my cousin and I woke up and went outside to investigate.  We found flattened grass and 3 clearings in the woods and tracks that led deep into the woods.

"A friend and I were sitting down on a pipeline right of way. We heard a noise that sounded like something that a large bird might make. A little while later, we heard something that sounded like someone knocking on a tree with a piece of wood or something. These sounds continued alternating, off and on for about 20 minutes or so. I remember that my friend and I were talking about how the sounds were a little strange, and getting louder. At one point, I realized that the sounds were coming from a point very close to us, and they seemed to be coming from the same place, so we stood up to see if we could see anything. It was then that we saw the animal. It looked at us, we looked at it, and we all took off running. Before running, I noticed that what I was looking at was about 7 feet tall, relatively the same proportions as a normal human, except for longer arms, and it was covered with shaggy (2-4"" long) grey hair. The face was not clear to me. I have slight astigmatism and I could not make out the features at the distance of about 20-30 yards. The animal crashed through the woods as it ran away- just breaking down everything in it's way. I kept looking back as I ran, and it just seemed to be going in a straight path up the hill towards Sample Road. Some years later I visited a wax museum in Niagara Falls and at the end of the exhibit was somebody's idea of a bigfoot. It looked very much like the one that I saw, except for the facial features. This one had big pointy teeth and looked pretty angry. I could not clearly see the face of the one I saw, but I don't think it had big pointy teeth and an angry expression.","There is a gas (I think) pipeline between Bryant Road and Sample Road.

"Here goes, I guess depending upon how you look at it I am either the luckiest person where Bigfoot is concerned or unfortunate in that coming forward in some people's eyes makes me either a story teller or a nut.  My sighting occured on a 1968 family camping trip near the Delaware River in Tohickon Valley Camp Grounds in Bucks County, PA.  I was 16 yrs old. I rode by bike over to explore the newest camping area that was as yet unfinished. As I rode through a clearing down a dirt road I had the unnerving feeling I was being watched from the bushes.  I told myself that I was being silly and proceeded to ride into the entrance tree covered area. I noticed the new bathhouse, wanted to check it out and parked my bike along side a split rail fence.  After finding the door locked I turned around to go back to my bike and that is when I saw not 8 ft away the most frightening and butt ugly creature I have ever seen.  It was standing upright on the other side of the split rail fence.  It had both hands on the top railing all the while shifting its weight back and forth rocking from side to side. I could clearly see the face in the sunlight but details of the body were lost in the shadow of the shade of the trees. It had a wild eyed look upon its face with the body language being restless. I must have been in shock as I calmly decided to get the heck out of there and back on my bike. When I got back to the our camp site I wanted to tell someone but I didn't even believe what I had just saw. I had no point of reference except that it was about 5'5 and monkeyish looking but not human. After I got home I wanted to tell my Mom or Dad or neighbor but was afraid they would make fun of me or think I was crazy. I kept asking myself how I was going to sleep that it would cause me nightmares. So I decided then and there to put it out of my consciousness. Everytime I thought how frightened I was, I pushed it out of my mind. Eventually I succeeded. Fast forward to 2002 and I find your BFRO website. (It has taken me another 5 years to get up the courage to write this report). I never gave it much thought about Bigfoot and Washington/Oregon state but it was interesting to see that this research was genuine and scientifically based.  I was surprised to see so many reports here in PA. As I was reading about other sightings one night, the memory of that camping experience came flooding back with the realization that I had come face to face with a Bigfoot. Upon reflection, I now realize that I have had three more encounters (1978-Bucks,1997 and 2005-Berks County).","Tohicken Valley Park is a public state camping facility.

"I was driving west on I-80 at 65 MPH, in the right lane with cruise control set at 65. We were returning from a wedding in NY. We had been in a an area of mountainous/hilly forest close to road. The country started to open up with some farmland. My wife dozed and I was rather lost in thought. I diverted my sight to about 30 degrees to the right and was startled to see something that got my attention and kept my attention until about 60 degrees to the right. It passed quickly out of view because of the speed of the vehicle and a bank and some foliage obscuring the view. The road is two lane, one way and I could not return to the area without backing a long distance. There was no other traffic in sight at the time. What I saw was a figure, only from about what I would assume was midway from between the elbows and wrist upward. The figure was what I think of as being the wrong color, it was the color of a kraft paper bag except slightly more reddish. ( seemed the wrong color from reports I have read). It was long hair covered and I could not see a face. It was not moving during the approx. 3 seconds that I was able to view it. It was in front of some woods, not dense, standing about 150 feet away on the other side of a strip of narrow, fallow, farm field. It seemed to be facing the highway although I could not see a face. I assumed the field had high growth in it as I only saw the upper portion.It was only the upper body and head with the hair obscuring any sign of a neck.I could not estimate size but it was stocky. Among my reactions, I was imaging something or someone had put up a mannikin. I rethought that, as there did not seem to be habitation nearby and a mannikin would likely have been a full figure to get maximum startle value. I know I saw something that I can accurately describe and draw a rather accurate picture. ( I am a retired industrial designer ) From the briefness of the sighting I can only say what I saw  and think that this sighting would only be of value if there were other sightings in the area. When I saw the figure a strong chill went down my spine that lasted several moments. This sort of thing is not in my normal experience.

"My daughter and I were traveling to Tok, Alaska, westbound approx. 30-45 minutes from US Customs at Alaskan/Canadian Boarder. We were towing a 27 ft. trailer and listening to music and enjoying the view. An object caught my eye standing in the treeline south of the eastbound lane. I saw something from the waist up reaching to a higher part of a white bark tree. I did a double take and slammed on the brakes and came to a complete stop. Whatever it was had its back to us and still was reaching up with its right arm.

I made a mental note using the tree as a height measuring device. I reached for the camera and my daughter but when we left our truck the animal was gone. We returned to our truck and continued driving until we pulled into the rest stop mentioned above.

While on our five day trip, we spotted more than fourty bears. I took hundrends of pictures of these bears and their tracks. One of which, was so big, it put chills up my spin and gave me and my companions a very uneasy sense of insecurity. What set this track apart from the others was it's enormous size and human shape. In one of the pictures that I took of this track, I placed my foot next to it on the ground, keep in mind I am wearing a size 13 boot. Whatever made this track was so heavy, heavier than the biggest bear, that it pushed the gravel so far into the earth that it made us truly speculate what we were looking at. Other pictures that we took of bear tracks were nowhere close to the indentation that this track had left. One of the most intriguing things about this track was there were no visible claw marks as with all the other bear tacks. Both of us felt extremely uneasy of our surroundings and had the feeling that we were being watched. For the rest of the day we didn't have much to talk about, and that night felt uncomfortable at camp. We never heard or smelt anything out of the ordinary. To this day I'm not too sure what we saw and I'm not making any claims other than the words I have put fourth. I would like to include the photos I spoke of, as maybe you or someone on your staff might help me shed some light on this situation. I want nothing but to put my mind at ease. Wether this is a bear track from an extrememly enormous bear or...? Please help if you have any input.","Approximately 95 miles east of Egegik, Alaska.

"Me and a couple of friends had been bored, when I decided we should take a walk through the woods behind my house. I didn't think much of it, as me and my friend have done it many times before. There were four of us, and we set out at about 11 o'clock at night. It was rather dark, but there was light from the moon. The weather was rather cold, as we did this in the winter. The area we walked on was game trails (trails that moose walk on) as well as trails used for mushers, runners, cross country skiiers, and that sort. We had walked about 2 miles from my house to another entrance where most people enter. On the way we had talked about unexplainable events or things such as bigfoot, and UFOs. When we reached the bridge where most people come in, one friend had smoked a cigarette. We then saw a light and decided to go on. On the way back, we heard wild dogs barking wildly, and decided to pick up the speed. It eventually became a sprint, whereafter we walked. When we walked, we continued talking about it. It was then I had realized, some thing had been following us, as well as testing us, or even harassing us. It was much earlier, I just didnt think about it. I had thought it was my friend Warren, who is sometimes clumsy. I had thought it was him who had made noises such as slipping, but it was really something throwing stuff at us. I had realized this about half way back. I asked if Warren kept slipping, when he told me it wasn't, and he thought I could have been pulling a prank. We stopped for a minute to listen when I told the others something strange was going on. We stopped, and shone a flashlight around, hearing noises such as steps, and branches moving and breaking. The leader had thought I had been playing a joke when I told him seriously, I wasn't. He decided to walk behind with me, when something threw snowballs, and nearly hit us on many occasions. It was then he realized that this was no joke, and we picked up a light jog, for most of the way. When we were almost out of the woods, we had again heard dogs, and maybe 20 ft away, the branches breaking, and again, something throwing stuff at us. By the time we left, it was about 3-3:30 in the morning. I did not go directly to my house because I didn't know if it was still following us. I know this was not a prank because the snow is more then 5 ft deep in the woods, and someone would have a extremely hard time to play a prank like that.","Few houses on the way, a power relay station.

"Every year me and a group of my friends camp in cheaha state park. Year before last, we where sitting outside our tent around the camp fire and it was about 11:00 at night. We where the ONLY ones in that camp site, so it was very quiet. We started to hear stange low noises almost like an old chainsaw trying to crank. Following that was a very high pitch humming noise. The sound was getting closer and closer. We took out our spot light and scanned the woods. What we saw was very disturbing....it appeared to be an up right figure, that was hairy and had a grey tent to its fure. It was standing behind a tree and was slightly hunching over, like it was hiding from us. We could see its back bowing out of the right side of the tree and its head coming out of the left. Theirs no doubt in my mind that it was an ape-like creature. It stood still for about 30 to 60 seconds.

"It was late June and I was driving home around 2:00 in the morning on a dirt road I use for a short cut from a friends house. It was dark, and cloudy I guess because there was no moon or stars out. I had just crossed over the creek and around a few curves when I saw something huge close to the side of the road. As I proceeded to get closer I turned on my brights. I realized this thing was standing on two feet, and kinda hairy, but looked as if it were humanlike. It looked to be 9 or 10 feet tall, larger that anything I wanted to stop for.  Its back was turned to me as if my lights were blinding it. This was like no human I had ever seen. I pushed the gas pedal as hard as I could, swung the car to the far left, and went around the thing as fast as I could. I never looked back, my heart was pounding because I was so frightened. It was enormous.   I had never really seen anything like that before. I had wondered if my mind was playing tricks on me because I was tired. I never mentioned this incident to anyone I just stopped traveling the road. Up until just a few weeks ago I wouldn't ride down this road even in the daylight. The reason for me to go back was absolutely amazing. My father  made a discovery of his own. Large footprints, feces, and a trail into the woods not far from where I had seen this ""thing"". I mentioned my story (about that night) to my parents when they told me about the discovery they had made. I went to the place with them to help cast the prints, take pictures, and collect some of the feces. If it hadn't been for their discovery, no one would have ever known what I had seen.

"My husband and some others were preparing a field for planting when he noticed a pile of pooh in the field.  He walked over to it and stated that he wondered what might have made such a large pile. As he looked around for horse or cow tracks, another person walked over to look at it and said ""Look at the size of these foot prints"".  They all began looking around and found tracks coming out of a grassy area onto a dirt road. The tracks went about 20 feet then turned left into the freshly plowed field (plowed the day before).  They proceded about 30 feet into the field. There you could tell where it paused to squat repositioning it's feet to do so and did it's business. While in this position it dug up some turtle eggs in front of it and ate them leaving broken shell behind. The feces were the consistancy of horse droppings in that they were of high fiber content and contained undigested muscadines(a kind of wild grape). But the droppings weren't in the shape of horse manure,(round ballshaped piles) but were long and cylindrical like that of a dog or human. The  feces(2) were about 18-24 inches long and about 2 1/2-3 inches across. Rather large I must say.    The tracks then turned left again into an area of tall grass, small pines and other small trees that lined a field at the edge of the woods. I wasn't able to follow them very far due to dead branchs, briars and undergrowth that blocked my progress. Plus I was wearing only sandals, shorts, and a tank top. Not prepared to trek through the woods. I took pictures of the  tracks and the feces with a yardstick for size comparison. I also took a specimen of the feces and turtle egg shells which are still in my freezer. I have a cast of a left and right foot. The right one broke trying to pick it up but is still n pretty good shape. The left one is completely intact.  They measure approx 18 inches long, 8 inches wide at the toes and 4 1/2 inches at the heels. The stride measured 3 feet from the toe of one foot to the heel of the next step. Each foot has 5 toes. A humanlike large toe on the inside of the step and each toe following being smaller than the last. There is an arch to both, showing it is not flatfooted. I took these samples to the Univesity of Alabama and showed them to a professor who is an anthropology professor in forensics. I walked away disappointed to hear him insist that what I had were Bear tracks. But he had been on a bear trip since I had spoken to him a few days prior about my find. When I arrived at his office, before he even looked at the cast he was talking bears and showing me books and pictures of bears and bear tracks.  I tried to say Bears don't have a Big toe, but he tried to make up reasons that these tracks of a ""bear"" had a big toe.  I realized this person was not going to believe what he was looking at was not a bear. It either frightened him to think it was a possible Bigfoot out there or he was embarassed to say he didn't know what it was. Just a ""Bear"".  Well there is our encounter of a Track sighting.

"I live in Tuscaloosa Alabama in the Yellow Creek Community  ... My husband and I have heard screams in the woods from some kind of animal that is so loud and it has a long guttural yell that sounds like a man... We have never heard anything like this. This has been going on now for three weeks in March 2012, almost every night just about 8:30, or right before it getting dark. Then it stops for about a month, and now it has started back up again. I have lived in the country all my life and I am 52 and my husband is 66 years old. We are not a bunch of kids making these things up. I know what cougars, coyotes, bears and wolves all sound like. We have never heard anything like this in the woods before... Other then fourteen years ago, my son who is in the Army and still is to this day. He and I were sitting outside one night at 11:00 talking... We heard the same thing yell out then... It came from behind my house and it yells out in that long guttural yell three times and after the third time it sounded like there was 50 or more coyotes were surrounding us and they stated yapping like crazy. ... The recent sounds are coming between my Grandfather's old house place and my home... It is about a 1/2 mile away. We have a huge lake behind us and nothing but woods... My grandfather has some old abandoned gravel pits and lakes close by too.. There is a swamp in front of our home about 1/4 mile away. I was also told when I was a child that back in the 1930’s my grandfather went through the gravel pit one night ... He saw something setting on a hill that looked like a huge hairy thing that had a face like a man.... This was before all the media hype from the Patterson films.. I need help because this thing is getting closer to our home. My husband doesn't have good hearing and he said he could hear it upstairs one night and it sounded like it was in the yard. We have animals, Cattle and Donkeys here we don't know whether to shoot at the sounds from where it is coming from or what... On March 31, 2012, it sounded like it was right down at the bottom of the holler right past our fence ... It sounded like TWO of whatever this thing is, was mad and was yelling at us. I got so scared I took off running into the house.... I have never been so frightened in my life, and believe me when I say I go outside a lot at night by myself I really do, we have a huge wraparound porch   I love to listen to the owls and whippoorwill at night but nothing like this has ever happen to me before.... Last week I went to put my puppy up for the night in our garage then I heard whatever this thing is, let out a scream, I called for my husband to come home it was back. When he got here we heard it growl. It came from the same area as before. Like I said before we heard it just about every night for 3 ½ weeks and then nothing… That night I told my husband HE BACK! Then the next night we heard it again but this time down in front our house down at the swamp. For the past 2 years people have stripped cut thousands of acreage of land all around here and a lot of animals have migrated around here.

"I and two of my friends were bored one night so we decided to do a little snowmachining. Though it was illegal to snowmachine in Anchorage, there were some good trails to ride on a little north of my house. We took off at probably 11 pm, rode up the road about a quarter mile, and cut off on the trails. It had snowed about 10 inches a few days before so there was fresh snow, with no tracks. I was leading the way for about a half hour, then we stopped and talked for a little bit.  We took off again and kept cruising on some sort of game trail that led to an opening in the woods.  I rode off into the opening with my friends following about fifty yards behind me. I came over this little mound and saw strange tracks leading to this spot in the snow where it looked like something had pushed aside some snow and layed down.  I figured it was just a moose or something.  But I followed the tracks over the next small hill and as I came down the far side my headlight pointed right on the back of a bigfoot. It was only about 10 to 12 feet in front of me.  It was running in the opposite direction.  I slammed on the brakes because I was scared out of my mind.  It continued to run away, jumped over a dead log covered in snow and disappeared into a group of trees and into the darkness. I was so surprised and scared I quickly turned around and rode back toward my friends. I met them back by the first mound and said ""We need to get out of here,""  and rode back towards my house.  When I told them about it back near my house, they laughed and told me it was probably a bear or someone in the woods.  But I was 100% positive that is was not a bear or anything else. The way it was running through the deep snow made me sure that it wasn't anything human.

"It was the month of July, 2009 in Fairbanks Alaska.  I was heading south on Auburn Dr toward Farmers Loop which was about 1 mile away.  It is a wooded area frequented by homes and in general would be considered a populated area.  Houses are on an average of about 100 to 200 feet apart with only the general area around and close to the homes cleared out.  Most of the area by far is wooded.  It was the section of the road where it passes by Pearl Creek Elementary school.  The school can be seen through the woods.  Some of the woods in the area are quite thick and in some places can’t be seen into more than about 10 or 15 feet.  But in this area, it had apparently been cleaned out quite a bit and sightlines into the section of the sighting were very open.  The school and vegetable garden could be seen off to the right from the road I was on.  It was about 6pm and I was heading home after a day of working on a deck I was building.  The weather was clear with the sun high in the sky.  As I was driving, I happened to notice a “man” standing by the right side of the road about 100 yards ahead.  It was more of an unconscious recognition.  There’s nothing unusual about a man standing on the side of the road in this area.  As I got to within about 50 yards, I looked closer.  “That’s no man” I said to myself (I was alone in the car).  Shortly after that, 1 or 2 seconds, he bolted into the woods towards the school.  He did it like a wild animal would do if spooked.  I didn’t slow down until I got to the place where I saw him go into the woods which is where I stopped.  I could see him running away from the road and when he was into the woods about 30 yards or so, he turned left and was now running parallel to the road in the same direction I was heading.  I got a good look at him, but not his face.  I could have probably seen his face had I not been so mesmerized and had the presence of mind to look at it.  I was busy noticing other things.  His fur or hair looked to be about 3 to 4 inches all over the main part of his body.  It was a reddish rusty color.  I was mildly struck by how red it was, but it definitely had some rustyness to it.  He was about 6 feet tall and looked to weigh about 200 lbs.  He ran with a strange “Hoppy” kind of run.  It wasn’t a limp.  With one foot he pushed off with was more a normal running move, but the other foot he pushed off with propelled him upward (about a foot or less) and forward.  I watched him until he disappeared into the woods.  There was a road about 100 yards ahead and I took off to get to it so I could turn right and in 20 yards turn right again to the road that lead to the school parking lot.  So the wooded area he was in was sort of a peninsula and he seemingly had to be in there somewhere. The woods I was looking into from that angle were quite thick and I didn’t see him and haven’t seen him since.  A little farther up on the right was the school garden that had people in it (around 7 - 10) which I’m now sorry I didn’t stop to go talk to them about it. The next day as I was driving in to work on the deck, I naturally slowed down in the area I saw him (stopped actually) and was surveying the area when a couple walking their dogs were approaching.  I flagged them down and told the story of what happened the evening before and they told me that about a week before they were with their dogs and were on the way other side of the school property by the soccer field and 3 kids came running over to them saying “Did you see the sasquatch, did you see the sasquatch.”  They also said that what appeared to be a Dad was with them who didn’t seem to excited about it. My conclusion to whether it was real or not is summed up by saying.  “It was either real or there was a man in a VERY, VERY convincing costume.” I reported it to the fish and game office in Fairbanks a couple days later.  The person who was taking the report was sort of rolling his eyes through the whole thing as he seemed to be writing it down on a piece of scrap paper-.  I even had to ask him to take my phone number just in case.",The intersection of Auburn and Farmers Loop is about 1 to 1 1/2 miles of the University of Fairbanks campus.

"This incident happened last night just after 11pm. My daughter was home alone. She lives with a relative, who was out of town. She called me at 11:22 pm; she was terrified. She said she could hear something walking back and forth by her bedroom window. She also said she looked out the window when she first heard it, and saw ""something"" big and black, really big. She described the ""thing"" to have been about 3-4 feet above the bottom of the window. When I went down to look behind the house this morning, I stood by the window.

Now, I've never known my daughter to afraid of anything, but last night when I went to pick her up, she was shaking like a leaf, she was hysterical, it took me almost an hour to calm her down. I questioned her about what happened. She called me about 5 minutes after she first saw it.  She was too scared to move. When I got down there, I would not look behind the house, but she was hiding in my relative's closet. She said it was walking back and forth right behind the house. She described the footsteps as a sound that someone very large walking on two feet, kind of like a ""stomping"". My daughter is very down-to-earth, not one prone to dramatics.

"Around 6:45pm on April 23rd, 2008, as my son and I were coming into the US from Canada.  We were traveling west about 14 miles on the US side of the US Canada border on the Alcan highway.   My son was driving.  If you've ever driven that road, then you know how the pavement has huge dips in it, I suspect from the freezing and thawing of the foundation of soil under the pavement.  Anyway, my son was watching directly in front of the car to make sure we took the smoothest path around some upcoming heaves in the pavement.  I was watching further down the highway as I had done our entire trip from Lethbridge, AB.  My hope was to catch a glimpse of a bear, moose or some awesome wildlife or some kind.   Anyway, we were on a slight decent down a hill, making a slight left corner and about to start up the other side when I saw what I thought was a human crossing the road, may 3-tenths of a mile ahead of us and up then slight incline.  He was a tall, odd looking fellow and I joked to myself when I first saw him..  ""Well, there is sasquatch up the road"", fully expecting to see that a person had crossed from a house or something on the left-hand side of the road over to another house or something on the right hand side.  When we got to the point where the structures should have been, there was nothing..  I mean nothing.  And no sign of any human, animal or anything else on the right hand side of the road in the woods.  This thing was walking upright like a man, long arms and what looked like a long neck from the side.  It had a fairly long gape in his walk..arms swinging with each stride.  It was all one color...I described it to my wife as the color of a Carhartt rust/brown full cover-alls.  I called her first thing when we got cell coverage in Tok.  She got on the web and saw where this was not the first time a sighting happened in this very same area.  I was so glad that someone else had seen it!  I hate to say it, but he looked similar to the representations on TV and pictures!  By the way, I have always thought this whole thing was a bunch of nonsense.

"This is an excerpt from a short story I wrote about this hunting trip for mostly my family.  I am 64 years old and have 40+ years in law enforcement, currently serving as chief of police. With hunting season not to open until the day after next, we were in no hurry and enjoyed the evening with a touch of good single malt Irish talking about our past hunts and the one we were about to have.  Loyd and Davis would not arrive until the first day of the hunt, presumably because Dave had become domesticate sometime after the previous year’s hunt and had to attend a retirement party before being allowed to leave Valdez for camp. With the evening expended and the toll the day had taken on us we were in our sleeping bags and doubtlessly turning logs into sawdust by 2300 hours.  The stove was stoked with fresh firewood and all was good.  About 0215 I awoke feeling way too warm, unzipped my bag, slinging the top off, when I heard a resounding crack of wood striking wood, similar to a Louisville Slugger solidly striking a large, sound Birch tree very close to the cabin.  There being no one within many miles of us, my attention was immediately focused on the sound.  A few seconds later, the sound was repeated, which was to be the pattern for several minutes while I attempted to evaluate it to determine its source.  I finally decided to wake Bill saying in just above a whisper, “hey Bill”.  He stirred responding with something that sounded like “what” and did not move again for twenty minutes; when he woke up and asked what was going on.  In the mean time the commotion stopped when I initially attempted to awaken Bill up and I was sitting on the bunk with my .450 in hand waiting for whatever eventuality might arise.  Nearing 0300 hours I finally returned to a sound slumber awaking well into the following morning. With a spot of coffee in our gullets and having explained to Bill the events of the previous night we explored the area of the old village, inclusive of the nearby grave yard, in an effort to find an explanation.  We found numerous paths traversing the grassy area around the cabins with a multitude of bedding sites.  Never did we find anything that would provide us with an answer to the question of the source of sounds.  Explaining this to another friend after our return, with the experience of spending many years living in numerous villages, he asked me if there was a native graveyard nearby.  It is less than 50 yards from the cabin.  Nevertheless, I named the source “Sassy”.","This is near Ketchumstock Mountain, about a 30 mile jaunt by ATV's to the west of the Taylor Highway south of Chicken Alaska.",Southeast Fairbanks County,Alaska,Fall,Report 25442: Hunter describes powerful wood knocks at a cabin in remote wilderness south of the town of Chicken,63.98869,-142.7691,8/20/2008,25442,Class B,bg6kp0y9nu,59.16,45.17,31.18,31.98,0.56,,0.63,0,0,,,Clear throughout the day.,0,,347,4.97

"When I was around 11 years old, I had a strange encounter in the field behind my house.  At that time, I believed I saw a crazy old man, but I now realize that is all I could rationalize it to be. I was walking alone at dusk with my dog.  This was not unusual as I loved to be outside- my parents often had to force me inside by calling me in for the night.  Well, from what I can remember of that particular night, I was picking up rocks in a ditch and looking at them.  I might have been looking for a certain kind of rock but I can't remember exactly what I was doing.  It was definitely getting dark, but I could still see well enough to keep after the rocks for awhile longer.  I remember holding a stick I was using to pry rocks out of the dirt.  It was very quiet and still and there wasn't much wind.  As I was looking at the ground, I heard a noise in front of me and I looked up to see what it was, and that is when I saw him.  He stood right in front of me at a distance of 5 to 10 feet, he was tall, but hunched and quietly staring right at me.  He wasn't much taller than a normal man, but I got the impression he was old because he was hunching.  He looked like Rip Van Winkle to me, and that is what I thought of when I saw him.  He had a long shaggy beard around his facial area, but he was completely naked but for the long shaggy hair that was in matts all over his body.  I remember the hair was thin at his face, the base of his neck, and upper torso, but thicker around his beard, lower torso and legs.  All the hair was grayish white and very long and shaggy.  Mats of hair dangled from him in tatters.  His feet were bare.  His face was very humanlike, but not quite normal as it had very exaggerated wrinkles- again, a reason I thought he was a crazy old man.  His head seemed normal, but there was so much hair it was hard to make out his features except where the hair was thinner.  He appeared gaunt and thin, but in just a moment I would realize he was not like an old man at all.  I screamed as loud as I could out of fear and I noticed my dog bolted towards the house while I was taking in the sight of this strange thing in front of me.  The shaggy old man let out a scream of his own when I screamed.  He was staring right at me screaming in a voice that sounded like a woman shrieking- he seemed very scared of me as well.  I turned to run for my house.  I looked over my shoulder to see if he was following me and I saw him run up the ditch in the other direction.  He was extremely agile and fast- he was definitely not Rip Van Winkle.  He ran in a full sprint, very quickly for someone so hunched. I think I caught the dog running back to the house, as I was so frightened.  I remember running into the kitchen and telling my Mom there was a crazy old Rip Van Winkle in the field.  I remember describing how he was old looking, hunched, naked, and his hair was very long and matted like he hadn't cut it in 20 years.  I told her about how he had hair all over his body.  Needless to say, I wasn't believed.  I became obsessed with what I called ""the Shaggy old man"" or ""the Crazy old man"".  I believed that he must have been an old deformed hermit.  I kept a notebook in which I drew many sketches of him.  I remember keeping the notebook secret from my family, hiding it out of fear of being ridiculed.  I wish I had those sketches now but sadly I've misplaced that notebook.  I remember I went back to the spot in the field looking for him on other occasions, but I never ran into him again.  I wasn't aware enough to look for prints or anything like that, but I knew that he was out there somewhere and I wanted to prove he really existed to others. What changed my opinion of this sighting was a late night visit to a bigfoot website.  I was just browsing their sightings index and I came across several sightings in the same county I lived in and all described white or grayish colored creatures.  Honestly, I didn't realize bigfoot were sighted in this part of the country at that time, or even for most of my life, and just seeing all those other sightings was a revelation.  I realized for the first time that what I witnessed may not have been a crazy old shaggy man, but rather a bigfoot.  When I think back on the sighting, it all makes sense in that light.  There would be no reason for a naked old man to wander that field, much less to be covered in grayish, white, shaggy tattered hair.  The only reason I never thought of it as a bigfoot before was that I had never heard of an Alabama bigfoot, so the thought never entered my mind.  Also, I had never heard of a whitish gray colored bigfoot, and this creature was thinner than a typical bigfoot description- maybe he was older or maybe even younger.  He looked a bit hungry to me, as he was not some hulking powerful creature, but he was still strong looking and extremely agile.","Around Moody, Alabama.",St. Clair County,Alabama,Fall,Report 8679: Adult recalls childhood sighting at dusk near Moody,33.6205,-86.4664,9/30/2004,8679,Class A,djfx22mjdg,78.01,66.605,55.2,51.38,0.69,0,0.57,0,0,,1017.5,Clear throughout the day.,7,9.21,328,0.44

"I had noted on my Limestone, Alabama Spring 1978 sighting report that I would eventually submit other sightings that involved myself, others I know or did know or had learned from talking with others. I did not know it would be this long to submit them, but I have since married, had a child, lived in three different locations, had five different jobs among other things since I last submitted that Limestone, Alabama sighting. This sighting/encounter below involved myself, and two freinds, it unexpectdly and without intent being my second. The event I relate here happened to me and two friends in April of 1994 while I was attending Troy State University, Troy. I was undertaking graduate studies at the time. I lived in a campus dorm and had become friends with several people in the dorm and about campus. One of these friends stayed in a room a few doors down. He dated a young woman that stayed in the International House across campus. I had been studying on that paticular night I write of and had become bored with it. My friend knocked on the door and came in. I for the most part had an ""open door policy"". The door may be open, but knock before you enter so I'll know you are there. As Kevin and I talked we agreed to go pick up his girlfriend, Donna and go to ""Lookout Mountain"".  I had been out to the place once before during the day about a month earlier so I offered to drive. We left campus around 11 pm or so. We headed up Hyw. 231 north. About 8 miles from the Campus we turned west/northwest (left) onto Co. Rd. 17   As we got closer to the so-called Lookout Mountian we noticed fewer and fewer houses. After about 15 minutes of driving we had found it and proceeded to park just off the road. We got out of my vehicle and then walked up to the top of this large hill. The hill is about 100 feet high from what I remember. It is supposedly the highest point in Pike County. The place seemed to be a well known and well used spot with open areas about the path to the top, besides one could see for several miles to the west, south and east from atop this hill. I recall seeing the rotating beacon that night at the Troy Airport several miles to the south. I knew we were not the first people to walk to the top and hang out nor were we going to be the last. Everything seemed cool. After about 15 to 20 minutes we three decided to head downhill toward the car and find something else to get into. I think we had decided we were going to go to Subway for a late night snack. Now here is where it got weird. Just after we started downhill I began getting a funny feeling and the hairs started to rise on the back of my neck, like something was there and we were being watched. Seeing how we were out at night in the country plus having a lady with us, Kevin and I had decided not to be foolish. We had both brought along weapons. I had a Colt .38 stuffed in the back of my pants in its holster and a few extra rounds in my pocket plus a good sharp replica Samurai sword. (Yes, a sword). My friend had a Glock 9mm and an extra magazine of rounds. My friend was in the National Guard at the time. I pulled out the .38 before we got even midway downhill. I had looked over to where Kevin and Donna were to my right. He had already taken out his 9mm so I knew he also sensed something by then as well. It was also about this time that we started hearing rather heavy footsteps. As we moved along I notcied the steps were on both sides of us. By the time we had arrived midway downhill we were aware that there were five maybe six...somebodys or somethings out not far from us. I recall that there were two and I'm pretty sure a third distinct grouping of footfalls to my left and two off to my right. Kevin was closest to the ones on my right so I'm sure he had heard them much better. Also by this time our Donna had become almost hysterical. I'm sure her few screams did not help matters much. Kevin said that it might be some other people messing with us like Frat boys. We stopped breifly. He shouted a few warnings that whomever was there had better leave us alone or speak up, he was ready to open fire. No answers. Nothing. I remained quiet, listening. Now any person in their right mind (perhaps even in a drunken state of mind) would have said something in order to keep from being shot at, I would think, yet there were no answers, no response of any sort. Just slience. We then continued to move downhill toward my vehicle but whatever they were kept back a bit and out of our sight and also to our sides yet they kept moving down along with us, not trying to hide their footfalls. As we approached the bottom of the hill we ran for it,  got into the my car as fast as we could,  cranked it up quickly,  backed up, and took off back the way we had came. I am not sure if whatever they were moved out into the dirt road behind us or not as we drove off. I looked back but, it was really too dark to tell. Aside from that the road was narrow and had trees along each side of it and I was being as careful as I possibly could so as not to run off this road. I don't recommend under such cirmstances trying to drive out of such a place and look back at the same time. It took several minutes after we got back onto Hwy. 231 for Donna to calm down. I was shaken up but not too bad. I suppose the driving had something to do with it. I'm not sure how Kevin felt. I assume that his military training had taken over for a time back on that hill. We never saw what they were. Except for the footsteps they were otherwise quiet. At first I was not sure what they may have been however after considering the strange activites I felt they could very well have been bigfoots. I still feel that is what they were though I can never be 100% sure. Even so, what they did while we were on Lookout Mountain would seem much like reported and researched bigfoot behavior.  After a few months and leaving Grad school I eventually lost contact with those two friends. I've not been back to Lookout Mountain since even though I have traveled up and down that part of 231 near there many times. I'm sure with a little driving about those dirt roads off Co. Rd. 17 I can find that hill again. I'm just not too sure I'd want to find it once again at night. ","The place of the sighting is in North/Northwestern Pike County at a place known by the name ""Lookout Mountain"". It is not a mountain at all, just a big hill.

"My mother and I were en route to Mobile,AL from Boothville, LA. It was approximately 2 A.m. We left Interstate 10 travelling north towards the Dawes community where my mother grew up and most of our family still reside.  We crossed the smaller of two bridges in close proximity to one another when we saw what we first thought must be a VERY large dog sitting in the opposite lane of the road. As we approached we saw the creature was sitting on haunches as a dog would but was face to face with us in the car ( an 80's model pontiac parisienne). It showed no fear and did not so much as budge as we passed it, it did turn it's head and watch us as we drove by. Unlike a dog the creature had a human like face that was the only part of its body not covered in long reddish brown hair. Even seated on its haunches the creature was about the height of an average man. It was more slender in build than the average ""Bigfoot"" we have seen portrayed in reports of sightings in the northern part of the US.

"One evening my wife and I decided to go to my hunting club property to a place where we used to go sit and talk. We got there just before dark and had been there for several hours when it happened. The place where we were is on a large power transmission line right of way.There is a small stream that crosses the clearing, and a very steep hill on the side where we parked. In fact, so steep that it is difficult to drive a four wheel drive down to the stream. On the other side of the stream there is a low level spot that then becomes another steep hill. I would say that the hills are a good 50 feet higher than the stream. I had parked my truck on the hilltop, and we sat on the tailgate facing the stream. Around 11:00 pm we heard a very loud snorting noise coming from the bottom of the hill, and the sound of brush moving and breaking. I thought that it was a wild hog, because they are plentiful in this area, so I told my wife to get in the truck, because I was afraid it would attack us. She got in the truck while I tried to find my flashlight and my gun. When she slammed the door, I heard a loud, low growl/grunt and it sounded like something large started running up the hill towards us. I was standing in the bed of my truck by now trying to shine my light down the hill, but the batteries were weak and I couldn't see very far.There was a very bright moon out so I turned off my light, and could see a large shadow moving around about halfway up the hill towards us. I was listening to it move around and make the same growl/grunt noise. I could also hear what sounded like breathing noises. I then caught scent of a strange, musky, sour odor and heard more brush breaking and what sounded like stomping noises. I was certain by now that this was not a wild hog, but couldn't figure out what it might be. So I told my wife to start my truck and rev the engine a few times and when she did, I heard what sounded like something crashing through the brush heading down hill and moving fast. We were both a little spooked by now so we left. As I pulled out onto the dirt road off the power line trail, I turned toward the bridge that crosses the small stream (the road roughly parallels the power line) a large number of deer ran at high speed across the road,heading away from the stream.

"On approx. January 5, 2000, three friends and I decided to camp on one of my friend's land.  We had two fourwheelers and a dog with us.  It was a rainy day and the ground of surrounding area was significantly wet.  We decided to camp anyway.  It stopped raining about dusk when my friend and I started to pitch the tent, while the other two went back to there house for some more supplies.  Mind you we were only camping about a mile from the road and one and a half miles from the landowner's home.  About ten minutes after their departure me and my friend started hearing strange grunts, foul smell, and heavy footsteps. It went on for about ten minutes, with sounds getting closer and at random, as though the ""animal"" was trying to scare us or get us to make a move. It stopped when my friends arrived back and we dismissed as deer, spooked by our presence. We told of the incident to our friends and the landowner's son explained that his dad had been experiencing ""strange"" occurences lately.  We went on with our camping and rode four-wheelers for about two hours. When we arrived back at camp, we decided to stay for the rest of the night. About ten minutes after arriving back, the same strange grunts and heavy steps began again. This time they were more aggitated and frequent. The sounds came within at least twenty yards of our camp. The area is heavily wooded so I could not see the animal at this time. The animal was across the creek at the beginning of the sounds and eventually jumped down into the creek, about a seven foot drop, and stayed there making grunts and heavy steps there for about five to ten minutes.  Being very frightened and defensive, I picked up about a ten pound rock and threw it in the vicinity of the animal below in the creek. I could not see the animal due to the foliage. It must have hit the animal because it gave a loud shriek and ran up the creek away from us, then jumping back up on the bank, a seven foot jump, and running back behind our campsite. It then proceeded to make very loud grunts and ran around the back of the campsite about twenty yards away in the woods out or our fire's sight. It then stopped and we could hear it breathing heavily. Talking amongst ourselves and shouting at the animal, it then made the most blood-curdling scream I have ever heard. I would describe it as high-pitched and seemed to echo everywhere around us. I have heard bobcats and screech owls and can tell you this was not one.  We then proceeded to leave hasitly on our ATVs and went and got the father of my friend. He came back with us and stayed awhile with no occurences. He left and we somehow got ourselves to stay for the night. Nothing happened the rest of the night and we went to sleep. I awoke at 3am to the same grunts and heavy footsteps. This time they were very close. They lasted by my watch til 345am. Not awaking my friends in fear of the animal becoming aggressive, I laid there and listened to this animal. Afterwards, I laid there until sunrise and told my friends of the sounds and occurences of the night. They asked me due to my, as they described, pale face and rattled demeanor. We then went and looked for any evidence of the animal. We found locks of hair in the trees, approx. seven foot high, and numerous large footprints, similar to a humans, but with no arch and a very large great toe. We then proceeded to follow the footprints to where, amonst downed trees and foliage, we found where a large animal had been laying. We found hair there also. We continued to trail the animal's leavings when came across the same sounds of footsteps. They were too scared to go over the hill and see the animal making the noise so they told me to. Reluctantly I did, and saw a large upright creature, approx. seven to eight feet tall, walking with its back to me. It was covered in hair, black to dark brown, and had an awful smell. It turned and alarmed by my presence ran away from me. I then turned and ran away from it towards my friends who I shouted to to run. They got up and ran and we ran back to our campsite and stayed there where I told them what I saw.  For a few months after that we heard the same grunts and shrieks down the creek where we camped that night. We frequently rode ATVs down there and an occurence was frequent. Occurences also happened at other places, two to three miles away from the area of occurence. A sighting was also reported at a park about a mile up the road from my house, three miles from the creek. We also found footprints in nearby rock quarry. My brother and I also saw a ""brown"" animal, who we thought to be a man at first, but, trailed him to find that could not have been a man, on hunting land a mile from our house. No occurences have happened in the past three years. But, I also don't ride or camp as much, either.",Near a creek that runs through the county called Phelps Creek.,Lee County,Alabama,Winter,Report 7427: Four youths have harrowing experience in Alabama backwoods.,32.6218,-85.4258,11/26/2003,7427,Class A,djg384dgf8,64.6,57.605,50.61,36.96,0.64,0.05,0.11,0,0,,1019.86,Overcast overnight.,4,9.99,113,1.17
"First of all I would like to say that I am a city girl and educated in medical science and not familiar with such things as Big Foot. I will say that I moved to Alabama 6 years ago, met and married my husband and he familiarized me with ""the ways of the wild""...ie sounds, smells, woods, etc.  I learned as much about the outdoors as I could and visit them often to this day. The experience I am about to share occured in January 2007.  My husband belonged to a hunting club and we spent most of our free time enjoying waterfalls and creeks....looking at stars...sitting and talking, absolutely everything slips away when you go into the wild. We decided not to go to the hunting club this night, but to an old abandoned grave yard.  An elderly couple used to go there years ago and keep it clean from debris and weeds but since they died it is grown over. It seems to be such a peaceful place full of history and romance. We had been there often and this particular night my husband was, to say the least, enebriated, and we were just sitting in the car talking...the moon was very bright and the stars were all out.  I kept hearing branches breaking, to my left, I was in the driver seat of the car and my husband was in the passenger seat.  I thought it was probably a rabbit or another critter of the night...but I started to get a very creepy feeling...as if I was being watched...I felt this for a time before my husband asked me why I was looking to my left constantly.  I simply said I feel like I am being watched and shrugged it off.  The feeling did get stronger and I continued to look to my left into the surrounding woods to find out exactly what was giving me this eerie feeling.  This went on for quite a while...I also noticed a foul odor but could not pin point it's source..I thought it was my husbands usual bout of, well to put it delicately, indigestion...I eventually saw a very tall figure and told my husband that someone was in the woods and he was standing between two tall pine trees...He thought I was crazy and laughed it off...I never stopped looking and saw this figure sway from side to side...from tree to tree..never approached...never made a sound.  I looked for about 5 or 10 minutes before I was just too scared to stay there anymore, so we left.  A similar experience happened to my husband 5 years ago right after I moved here. It is currently posted on this site. I have been encouraged by Mr. M. Collins to post my experience..throughout this experience my husband never witnessed what I saw. He says he could not see anything out in the dark because of the glare of the dashboard lights (we had the radio on low). I am not sure what exactly I did see...I just know that I have frequented these woods for years and have never felt like that before...I do not intimidate easily and I was extremely ready to leave that night. I have gone back to the graveyard, but not nearly as often as before the incident. I am always on guard there.  I know I saw something and I don't believe it was a man.","Take Hwy 29 East from Interstate 85  The area is near Halawakee Creek in Lee County, Alabama and is between Hwy 29 and Hwy 280 East.",Lee County,Alabama,Winter,Report 18376: Couple reports possible stalking near abandoned rural graveyard outside town of Valley,32.67715,-85.21545,1/30/2007,18376,Class B,djg3uusn0n,52.26,39.03,25.8,21.13,0.49,0.2,0.42,0,0,,1022.44,"Mostly cloudy starting in the afternoon, continuing until evening.",3,10,275,3.46
"I had purchased a fence for my cats and my husband and I had spent most of the day putting it up .We stopped working on it that evening so we could have time to feed the animals-horses,dogs chickens and cats- before dark . By the time we were finished feeding everything it was dark but I had decided to run a cord with a light on it out to the fence and work on it a while longer adding more clips to it . The local high school is about 1 or 1 1/2 miles from our house and they were having a tractor pull that night and I could hear the noise from the tractors .Other than that, it was quiet out . The fence is out close to the barn which has a security light on it . With that light and the light on the cord that I had hanging from one of the tall fence post, the area where I was working was well lit . I had been working for about 2 hours when I heard a noise coming from the woods to my left about 100 or 150 yards away . There is a deer trail that runs through the woods there and the noise I heard sounded like something had caught a deer . I continued putting clips on the fence, not thinking anything else about the noise I had heard and about 25 or 30 minutes later at about 100 yards up from the place I had heard the first noise, I heard something make a loud hollering howling sound . Not wanting to believe what I heard, I told myself that it had to have been the neighbors dog . They have a huge dog that has a hoarse bark . Anyway, I decided it was time for me to go inside . I gathered up my tools and just as I was about to get on the four wheeler, I heard it holler,howl again . This time the sound came from the area where I had heard the first noise, that sounded like the deer had been caught . I didn't take time to turn the four wheeler around . I backed it all the way back to the house, right up to the back door .I jumped off, ran in and locked the door .I was shaking so bad I could barely stand . It was like I was having a nightmare, I couldn't believe what I had heard . I told my husband and we went back out with the gun but we didn't hear anything . I knew what I had heard sounded like the sound the bigfoot made on the programs I had watched on TV and at first I even thought I was crazy for even thinking that that's what it could have been and Iv'e tried my best to convince myself there's no way it could have been a bigfoot but it hasn't worked . My husband keeps saying that he believes I had heard something and that there's a good explanation for it because there's no such thing as a bigfoot . He hasn't been able to give me a good one yet . I have called the local game warden and tried to mimic the sound  I had heard asking him if he knew of any animal in this area that would make this sound and he said no . He did say that the only thing he could think of might be some sort of canine - a coyote or if it was more of a high pitched sound it might be a fox . Please believe me this was no coyote, no fox, no small animal could make a sound like the one I heard . It was 100 or 150 yards away and it sounded like it was standing right behind me . I could tell that it was coming from something very large because of the power behind the sound and the sound it's self was like a loud Ahoooooooo .There's no way anyone could have been in the woods faking this . It was real . This experience has affected me big time . My doors are closed and locked  now day and night - I don't think a locked door would stop it, but I lock them anyway . If I'm at home alone during the day and I need to go outside for anything, I carry a gun with me . Under no circumstances do I go outside at night now . I'm afraid to sleep at night . I'm scared to death here now . I don't know for a fact that what I heard was a big foot but I believe with everything inside me that it was . When I found this sight on the internet and listened to the sounds that had been recorded, I swear to you, I started shaking all over again . It sounded exactly like what I had heard-  Exactly-  except what I heard was very close to  me. This is the bad part of it all - When I called the game warden to tell him what I had heard and ask if there was any animal here that could make this sound, he said some sort of canine maybe . I said ""No Sure, it wasn't any kind of dog or coyote or fox or crane - ( which is what my husband said it could have been-but no it was no crane . I've heard cranes before and they do make a scary sound, but it wasn't a crane.) or any kind of cat , I've never heard anything make a sound like I had heard in real life before. ) He then ask "" what did it sound like?"" I hesitated for a second or two  before  I said "" A Bigfoot "" He said back to me  ""well, like said it could be some sort of canine or something like that."" When he said that, I started crying - I couldn't help myself, I cried and told him that this was no joke that I was serious and that I was scared to death now . I believe he was thinking he had real nut case on the phone crying, telling him how scared she was cause she heard a BIGFOOT in the woods behind her house. I think he got a good laugh out of it anyway . Please believe me every word I've put down on this page is true . There is something in the woods behind my house that hollers, howls and I'm very scared of what it could be . I didn't see what it was and I pray to God that I never do, I did hear it and I also pray to God that I won't hear it again . But with God as my witness this is true . One more thing I would like to say that I have wondered about. I mentioned the tractor pull and I've wondered if maybe the sounds the tractors were making when they would start to pull -the winding up sound of the motors could have been the reason this thing was hollering-maybe it thought there was another one around calling to it but in fact it was the tractors, I don't know. I've thought about what everyone around where I live would be saying about me if they found out that I said I had heard bigfoot in the woods behind my house. If no evidence could be found to show that what I was saying was true, I would have big looney toon wrote across my back as long as I live here, I would be laughed at by everybody. Iv'e decided that I and only I know what I heard and I know how it's affected me -I feel like I've had a close encounter with evil - something I had heard might exist but I didn't really  ever want find out if they did, especially from personal experience . I know that I and only I will have to deal with this feeling and that I don't really care what people here say as long as I know I'm telling the truth . If  somehow someone did this as a hoax, (no way) they did a great job. I'd have to say that they're professionals. No way is this a hoax on my part. I've never been more serious about anything before as I am about this. Because I am so afraid here now, especially at night, I called the game warden back today and asked if could investigate this just to see if there might be evidence that this thing might have been or might still be in the woods here. He said that they hadn't had anyone else report anything  like this but he would check it out. I don't know if he will or not. The answer to my prayers would be for him to investigate it, find it, catch it, and take as far away from my house as he could go. Now that I've wrote all this down and hopefully been able to convince you that this is not o hoax- I only hope that your sight is no hoax!",,Limestone County,Alabama,Summer,Report 15597: Possible vocalizations reported near Tanner,34.73139,-86.97057,9/22/2006,15597,Class B,dn4jsftvnb,81.05,78.065,75.08,64.73,0.76,0.74,0.01,0.0164,1,rain,1012.61,Rain in the morning.,5,9.31,153,4.89
"When I was about 8 or 10 yrs old, I saw a Bigfoot. It was on Green mountain near Huntsville, Ala. It was unpopulated then. Now there are million dollar homes there. I was on my way home from my uncle's house on a gravel road. I was on one side of a hill. The road went down this hollow and back up the other side. In the ditch line was Bigfoot, about 8 ft. tall with arms that looked like they reached down past his knees. It was slightly leaned foward looking straight at me. It scared the daylights out of me. So I went back to my uncle's house and told him. He got his shot gun and we went back. It was still there looking at us. Uncle threw up the gun to shoot and I told him we needed to get closer.

"I was staying at the Marriott hotel 6th floor in Huntsville Alabama at the Space and Rocket Center-At 5:40am on Feb 24th 2009 I went on the balcony to drink my coffee as the room was too stuffy and hot.  I was out there just thinking and staring off at the woods when something caught my eye--after refocusing on it I realized there were legs, then arms, then I could clearly make out his face.  The creature stood 6-7ft tall and was staring directly back at me-it seemed to have fine hairs all over -grey color hair that got more black as the hair got closer to the skin--the tips of the hair were much lighter--the face (lips, eye lids, etc) were more of a very dark brown-it stood very erect, was very muscular, and did not seem to have the apelike protruding mouth and nose but more flat faced human like--after 30 seconds he started rocking back and forth--I then realized this was moving and could in no way be mistaken for a dear or bear or anything else--this was a fully erect apelike animal that seemed to want me see him --he was rocking back and forth from side to side.  After the initial 30 seconds he rocked for about 10-12 seconds then stood and stared at me --I was on the 6th floor about 120 yards away in decent lighting due to hotel lights and street light behind loading area of hotel-he then would stare back then he would remain face forward with feet only about 2 feet apart would lean over to his left with his right arm would start pulling bark off a very large pine tree--it looked as if someone were in a sawing position--then he would stand up stare at me then rock and then pull bark--this was done in that order 3 times over a 5-6 minute period--after five minutes of re-verifying what I was looking at I felt this creature was docile and smooth moving--I decided I would try and get a closer look--as I opened the sliding glass door he stared and I stared back--I ran out of the hotel room and there was security in our hall laying the morning news at the hotel room doors--I asked him to come with me and asked for back up since he had no gun--we ran around the corner outside - as we were running I Finally got the nerves to tell them what I saw--we get to the reference points I had chosen and there were a lot of fresh bark removed from the large pine tree--I tried to pull bark from it to no avail -- it was too hard--I am 6'4"" 300 lbs.  I went back after 7am (light) -- I did notice what looked like scat --it took the form of explosive diarrhea and looked like a hundred birds had pooped in a small area--like in a shotgun pattern-heavy in the middle and lighter to the outside perimeter-I put a large handful in a Marriott laundry plastic bag--It looks like feces and digested berries and seeds. (It was dry although it had rained the night before)  One of the Marriott employee's saw two large footprints --more like deep indention's in the pine straw--I took off my shoe and placed my foot in it and there was about a one inch area all the way around my foot in order to fill the indention--Something very heavy had to make these indention's--I tried and I am 300lbs and could not.

"My son has convinced me to contact you. I will tell your organization of our encounters. On November 28 2008 I was visiting a friends house in Lacey's Spring Alabama. His house is in a small middle class  neighborhood with mountains and woods that stretch for miles behind his home. I woke up to use the bathroom at about 4:00AM and had just laid back down when I began to hear loud vocalizations. The sounds where very similar to the Ohio and Mississippi recordings. I was inside the house and his heating unit was running so they must have been very loud outside. I got up and went out on his back deck but by the time I got there they had stopped. I listened for about 10 minutes and heard nothing. The heating unit was next to the deck and was quite loud so I decided to go back inside. About the time I started to fall asleep it started again the howls lasted about 3 minutes. Then stopped I thought that it might be my friend snoring in the back bedroom but I don't believe this was so because the neighborhood dogs where barking throughout the area in response to the howls. At this point I knew something outside was making the noise. I wanted to go into the woods for a better listen, but walking into the woods with no one in the know and not prepared for self defense or to photograph or record the creature did not seem like a wise proposition. The howling started and stopped 3 more times and finally finished at dawn.

My sighting happened last summer. I was kayaking down a creek. It was about the middle of the day. I was comin down the creek. The creek I was coming down is deep in some parts and shallow in some. There are always deer and turkey moving through. When I came around the curve in the creek a splash happened right in front of me. I thought it may have been a fish. So I kept paddling. Then three more splashes hit by me. The last splash I saw it was a rock. So I slowed down in the creek to look. I started looking in the direction the rocks came from. It was sitting on its knees like a person would. Then it stood up. When it stood up. The hair on back of my neck did. Me and it made eye contact for around 30 seconds. It turned and started running through the woods. I've seen and heard people run through the woods. Its stride was wider than any humans. When it ran it didn't bother dogging sticks and stuff. It just ran through the brush. After that I turned around and started paddling back to my truck. I went back down there that night to see if I could spot light it. I done a howl and waited to see if it would respond. But than I heard two knocks back to back. I knocked on a tree. It knocked back at me. But it was off in the distance.

"Either December 25 or 26, 2002. Franklin County Alabama Pine Forest/Hardwood Forest/Open field Between 4:00 and 5:00pm. I was hunting along a fenceline late that afternoon when some deer came running out of a pine thicket, down the netwire fence row, and jumped over to where I was.  I was roughly 75ft from the fence when this occurred.  My jack russell dog saw them and took aften them. He often follows me hunting as this place is next to my house.  After chasing them for about 10 mins he comes back towards me when he suddenly stops, looks towards the pine thicket, lets out a weird yelp and takes off towards the house visibly something wrong.  I stood there and heard a noise and the deer that had ran by came back by as if something had spooked them again.  As they came back up the hill I heard what appeared to be a large animal coming from the thicket.  I thought it was another deer that had separated from the herd and was coming back to join up.  As I watched something on two legs appeared roughly 100ft from my position from out of the thicket.  It came down the fence line and went over the fence in the direction of the deer.  I could clearly see that it was on two feet and did not pay me any attention.  I watched it for less than a minute before it disappeared down the hill from me. Numerous hunters have reported seeing something of this nature around here before.  I sent in a follow up the other day to tack on to this story but was notified that you never received this story.

"I was assigned to Ft Rucker, AL from Oct 1991 until Jan 1997 as a fire fighter. As military firefighters we would often be assigned to small airfields (stagefields) around Ft Rucker. At the time this happened I was assigned to Tabernacle stagefield. Tabernacle was on the north west end of a large impact area used for aerial gunnery by pilots in training. During a typical duty day we would have several down time periods where aircraft were not flying. These down time periods would typically take place around noon and evening lasting 2.5 to 3 hours. When I was assigned to Ft Rucker, I had met some other Soldiers that introduced me to Indian “relic” hunting. This consisted mostly of lots of walking through tilled fields, creek washouts, and recently cleared timber tracts looking for arrowheads and anything else related to the old Indian tribes that formally lived in the south east Alabama region. I had found that the down times when aircraft were not flying often granted me the chance to get out in the woods to hunt for arrowheads. Often I was able to get several miles away from the stage field during the down times and was usually by myself for several hours. My typical hiking outfit was to put on a pair of cargo shorts, an old pair of army boots, a belt with a canteen, a pouch (for any finds), a large survival knife, ball cap and a walking stick. I usually would not wear a shirt hoping to get a tan while out walking. This day in particular was in I left my stage field around 1100 AM or so. I headed East, North East for about 1.5 miles on an improved asphalt road that bordered the impact area. I then head north down a dirt road (path was more like it) that was seldom traveled. The road went up and down some gentle hills and was bordered on both sides by heavy vegetation and thick woods. I believe I had walked maybe ¾ of a mile when I was approaching a small creek crossing which was not unusual. I was maybe within 50 feet of the creek when off to my left side I heard a lot of movement approximately 150-200 feet into the woods appearing to come from the creek bank. I heard what I can only describe as a grunt and my first though was a wild pig. That thought was quickly erased though, as I immediately got instant chills…goosebumps running my entire body…and had the heavy feeling that I was not alone. I heard another grunt and peered into the woods from where the sound came from and saw a large “shadow”…easily 6 to 7 foot tall stand from the creek bed. Because of the thick woods I got no clear view of it but my first thought was that it was a large very dirty man but it definitely had the appearance of a man shape. I only saw this thing for a few seconds as it appeared to see me…and me watching it and it turned and went crashing into the woods away from me. I wasted no time turning my walk into a trot away from what I had just seen. Whatever it was it scared me and as I headed back to my airfield I tried to make sense of it. The only thing I could conceive it being was that maybe it might have been a stray horse back in the woods. I know this sounds very unlikely but I really didn’t want to believe I might have seen something I could not explain…a horse in the woods I could almost believe. I never went back into that area of the woods again, and seldom ventured into thick woods period after that. I never gave it much thought after that as I had chalked it up as being a horse, which seemed to make sense to me. I did bring my strange experience up a couple of times to some folks but they thought I was kidding them and none of them had ever heard of anything like that in Alabama before. Two things led me to revise my thinking of what I saw that day. The first being this. In 2000…I was and am still living in Kansas and serving in the Army Reserve. We had a new Soldier join my unit. He was a former Ranger Sniper team leader having been assigned to the Ranger battalion at Ft Lewis, WA. He was a good old country boy from Kansas living in a small town. He and I became very good friends and later served in Iraq together. We would often talk about events in our lives at length. During one conversation I related my story about what I saw in the woods assuming he would think I was nuts. But…he believed me. As a matter of fact he said if I saw something I found hard to believe he said that I should just go with what my gut told me. He then informed me about his experiences. He told me about his time up at Ft Lewis and as a sniper he would often be in the woods alone for days at a time in hide sites during training missions. He told me that at night in the deep woods he would often feel as if he was being watched and would hear the sounds of something large moving through the woods. Now this fellow was an experienced woodsman and was used to the sounds and smells of the woods. On occasion he was able to see something quite large in the shape of a man moving around his hide site through his night vision goggle. He said it would never come too close…just kind of checking him out. He said he never felt threatened by it and on the occasion it would make some sounds (grunts or whistles) as if it was agitated and he would talk calmly too it. He said that he wood talk in a slow, low voice telling it “I’m not here to hurt you, just calm down, I don’t mean no trouble for you”. He said that usually after he spoke towards it, it would just move away from him and would leave him alone. He said this happened numerous times as he was often in the same area. He told me he had no doubts at all that “Bigfoot” was around but he would never do anything to harm it and he felt that if left alone it would not harm anyone. So that got me to thinking, maybe that afternoon in the woods I really did see a Bigfoot. The second reason I feel that I didn’t see what I convinced myself was a horse is that after culling the BFRO website I found that I am not the only one to have seen something in Alabama. So…I am not alone and I am now convinced that what I saw was real…and not something else. I haven’t shared this story with very many people…but maybe this is the time to do it.",I have looked at some satellite images of the area and cannot pinpoint the exact spot just the area within a few hundred yards.

"01192008 Suspicious knocking was heard about 3:00 am as my husband was camping with  Boy Scouts  on the side of a ridge SE of Henderson Peak about 200 yds from State Rd. 281.  (topozone.com map 33° 27.85'N, 85° 52.21'W - across road from red #13 about 200 yds. ) This is just south of the Cheaha State Park line.  It was about 14 degrees with intermittent howling wind.  There were 3 sets of 2 knocks each about 100 yards north of the campsite described as “a piece of firewood hitting another.”  It was very loud and the knocks, though themselves rhythmic, were spaced so that the wind died down before they occurred again.   These were not little limbs hitting each other and he was not able to determine if there were any responses because of the wind.   There were no campers north of them and the only other campers on the mountain that were encountered was another Boy Scout troop camping about 4 miles away directly on Lake Chinobee.  My husband is an avid bfro.net browser (and hopeful member of a future BFRO expedition :-) who awoke and immediately felt that this was consistent with other knocking activity.  Due to the inclement conditions and not wanting to scare the younger kids in camp, he did not have a chance to follow up.  Although he didn’t mention the sounds the next morning, another adult did, and with careful, roundabout questioning all other factors for the sounds were excluded (trees falling, wind, limbs hitting each other due to the wind, etc).

"It was April of 2011. My son, daughter-in-law, wife and I had been over at my in-laws having dinner. My son and his wife and their infant son had recently moved in with us. We were in the process of adding a new laundry room and garage on the back side of our house. When we came in from next door my son and his family were ahead of my wife and me by a minute or two. I noticed the lights to the new addition were on and figured that one of them had gone out to retrieve their laundry. I opened the back door and said is anyone out there. I didn’t yell so I thought they might not have heard me. I stepped out on the patio and started walking toward the garage that didn’t have a door hung yet. As I did I saw a dark figure at the back of our SUV. It scared me that there was “someone” in, or had just passed through our garage. Without saying another word I ran back into the house to get my 410 shotgun and let me son know to join me outside. This only took 30 seconds or less. I went back out but this time I was yelling “if there is someone out there you better speak up or I am going to shoot you.” My son joined me and we ran out into the yard both yelling for the person to identify themselves. We circled our house and saw nothing. It had rained earlier in the afternoon and evening and as we came back to re-enter our house confident that what I had seen ran away we noticed footprints on the concrete patio deck. These footprints at first looked like that of foot gloves people that fit each toe like a glove does the hand. But the thing that was conspicuous was the size. They were enormous. Not only long but wide, huge like that of what an NBA star might leave. (I say that because I have a pair of shoes owned by an NBA star that my nephew gave me who is on an NBA coaching staff.) My point, these were very large feet and very wide strides. It then dawned on me how large the figure I saw in the garage had to be. As stated I own an SUV and at the back part of the garage where I saw the figure the concrete starts to slope down from the garage. This figure I saw was head and shoulders over the top of the SUV and he (it) was already on the slope because he was not inside the garage when I saw him. I joked to my son and later to my family; you know that thing I saw that night was big enough to be a Sasquatch. We all laughed because we had not heard of any other Bigfoot sightings in lower Alabama. Then your show comes to television and I go on your site today and learn that there was indeed a Bigfoot sighting on Ft. Rucker back in the 90’s by a solder. I live just five to six miles from the post. I’m not convinced that what I saw should be reported to you but I do know that if it was a person I never want to see them again on a dark night in my yard because they are a very big person.

"In July of 1985 on a hot but clear afternoon I was driving home on County Rd. 21 about 1 mile from my home when up ahead I saw these dark figures approach the side of the road.  They were standing there in close proximity to each other and as I neared them, all the while slowing down my speed, I could see three distinct and different sized figures. I've lived in the country all my life.  I grew up playing and hiking the whole countryside and I knew the area around my home real well.  I have always loved watching animals in the woods but I did not know what to make of these creatures.

I could not see any facial features but they're arms were long for their bodies. They appeared to hesitate as though they couldn't decide what to do as I approached them in my car.  All of a sudden they ran across the road in front of me and vanished into the thick bushes and trees on the other side of the road. They did not stoop over but ran upright and with swiftness.  I was stunned.  They were no animal I had ever encountered before.  I started to slow down and get out of my car, but all of a sudden it hit me.  I've seen something that can't be explained other than these creatures are not normal creatures.  I was spooked and the hair stood up on the back of my neck.

"It was a hot afternoon in august. I heard sirens in the distance. the local rescue squad was responding to an incident. curious about what was going on I decide to go and see. when we arrived, I found out that 2 bham men had went canoeing and had not been seen since. the sherrif wanted to call for a helo to search the river. I piped up and told them that in was not a good idea. the trees cause a tunnel affect over the river. the helo wouldn't be able to see under the growth. on top of that the sun was starting to go down. he agreed and sent 6 men in 2 canoes down the river. 30-45 minutes passed and we were told that they had been found at a local bar in b'ham. my friend and I volunteered to pull the rescuers out of the river at a mid point near the road. we set off. the light was almost gone. as we made our way down the trail to a place where the stream and the cahaba meet my friend took off ahead of me. he knew the area better and i could see his light moving ahead of me. as I entered the bottoms where a bamboo thicket grew, I heard brush breaking and grunting noises to my left. I quickley made my way across the stream. I felt much better and safer once I crossed the stream. as I rejoined my friend at the intersection of the stream and river, I told him about what I had heard. he said it was probably a boar rooting for acorns. we sat for about an hour waiting. the moon was out quarter waxing, and hot as hell 100% humidity 90 degrees. after waiting I said to my friend that we must have missed the rescue team in the night. so he went to find out and he left me there on the bank to make sure they were not just slow getting down the river. another 30 minutes went by and I started seeing a light up the bank approaching my position. I pulled myself up into the foliage to camo myself, just in case the light was moon shiners or pot growers. they are notorius for bibb county. minutes passed and I heard my name being called.

"My family and I went to Ludlow, Vermont for Columbus Day weekend since we enjoy the northeastern woods. We all enjoy observing the local flora and fauna in their natural settings and we often drive and/or walk the back roads looking for deer, moose, bear and whatever else we can spot. One evening we went ""Moose Spotting"" on Tyson Road since during a summer trip to the same area, earlier, we had observed eight moose in one evening. As we drove along Tyson Road I saw a large bipedal form cross the road in two strides. I asked one of my daughters, ""Did you see that? Tell me what did you see."" I purposely didn't say what I'd seen since I wanted to know if she'd seen what I'd seen. I wanted to be sure I had not imagined it. Very quickly she said, ""I don't know what it was but it was real big, maybe eight feet tall, hairy and crossed the road in two steps."" She saw the same thing I did.  It crossed the road about 50 feet ahead of us and judging from the trees where it crossed the road I'd say her height estimate is accurate +/- 20%. My other daughter didn't see it since she was in the back seat and was looking out the side windows of the car. I still don't quite believe it but I know what bear, deer and moose look like in natural settings since I've been hunting for 40 years. It wasn't anything I had ever seen in the woods. It walked across the road in two strides, was heavily built, covered in short dark hair and, as stated previously, approximately eight  feet tall. One more thing.

It stumbled slightly at the edge of the road and swung its arms to regain balance then continued across the road and into the tree line. I don't care to speculate how fast it was moving but I'm sure it was faster than a human, maybe about as fast as a deer can run. I stopped when I got to where it crossed but I did not see anything else. My wife who was with me did not spot it and if the people in the oncoming car spotted it, they made no indication.","Natchez Trace Parkway, approximately fifty yards north of mile marker 307.",Tishomingo County,Mississippi,Winter,Report 13494: Sundown sighting near Tishomingo State Park,34.60905,-88.19894,1/5/2006,13494,Class A,dn1kburkrd,50.99,42.36,33.73,33.98,0.73,,0.21,0,0,,,Clear throughout the day.,0,,351,5.26
Let me start out saying I grew up in the woods of northern Michigan(I was 18 at the time ) I have hunted trapped and fished just about every critter in those woods since I was a very small child and have never experienced any thing like this (that couldn’t be attributed to any thing conventional) before or since ! The night started out normal my ex and I departed for a night of coon hunting. We released the old black and tan hound about a mile from where the encounter happened on a large creek bottom of Fletcher creek just north of eight road where the creek crosses the road this was  around 9 o clock pm . The dog took off across the thick creek bottom headed west then north crossing an open meadow and some pine trees before striking the coons sent and quickly treeing the coon on the edge of a large swamp in a big white pine everything normal so far. we didn’t have a gun with us that night so we quickly loaded up the dog and took off to tree another. We released the dog again where the road  (possibly 5 or 5and a half road)intersects a old beaver pond where she promptly struck a scent and made a long arching track north then east then south east covering a few miles of the dense forest quickly. I soon realized the dog had struck a bear or bobcat track as she had chased and treed both (in the area and never chased trash deer coyote etc..) and was covering ground quickly in a circle so we decided to intercept the dog on the next trail by the time(around 10 thirty) we got ahead of the dog she had treed whatever she was chasing about a mile south of the road( I don’t know the name of it there is a hunting pen and an oil well on the end of it) so we set off unarmed with two lights nearly dead after about a half mile whatever she was chasing took off again this time easterly assuming it was a bobcat I shut the lights off and stood silently (a bobcat will jump tree and run if it sees a light coming) the dog promptly treed or/bayed the animal it was chasing again about a mile away we headed that way using the lights sparingly again the animal ran after repeating this another two or three times we finally closed the gap to about 300 yards when suddenly  the dog went silent and ran straight  to us (without calling she wouldn’t come if I called I never could call her off a trail EVER!) tail between its legs whimpering I thought this was odd because the dog had fought bear coon and bobcat and never backed down or lost I didn’t think much of it I was glad to have her back so we could go so I  just leashed the dog and started back out we were less than disorientated because of the long twisting turning chase and no moon and to make matters worse the lights died and we had no cell service! after about an hour of walking in what I thought was the right direction I began to hear something big trailing slightly behind and to the left me I stopped and asked my friend if she had heard any thing she admitted she had but didn’t want to admit it for fear of me picking on her  we continued and so did the trailing I kept throwing the dim dead light back in the direction of the animal each time the brush would crash and limbs high I don’t know how high but higher than a deer could reach and only a large bear on its hind legs could move or break would react to something fleeing the light before it would die out again after a couple seconds the dog continued its unusual behavior (tail between its legs and skittishness)especially when the animal began circling us we would hear it then it would be silent and a leaf would crunch a head of us I would shine the light in that direction and the sound of heavy pounding feat and big 3 inch around trees would break and shake then the light would go dead The whole time I felt as if something large and intelligent was observing us sizing us up the hair on the back of my neck was standing up and shivers ran down my spine the whole incident lasted an hour or 2 we never saw the animal but heard it circling us and breaking huge limbs trees 2 to 3 inches were being broken within fifty feet of us and less and we never saw the animal just the vegetation around it broken or moving after it fled our light for a brief moment before the light would die. It was almost as if it were deliberately breaking trees to intimidate us or that is what it felt like. I never looked for hair or tracks  there was a good foot of leaf cover so tracks were unlikely I never thought of it as a big foot just an unexplainable anomaly . I assumed it was a bear but there was no “woofing” or jaw “popping” both of which I have heard before and I don’t believe the dog would have backed down after treeing and chasing a few already I don’t know if this was a big foot or not it is near some of the other sightings on your web page (I had no idea there were big foot sightings in Michigan) so I figured I would share my story  I’m not a big foot believer I believe in the possibility but I’m still skeptical. The only other   strange occurrence I had occurred within about  a mile of the other 3 weeks or so earlier when the dog treed a young bear we left the tree to immediately hear a low cry like that of a juvenile animal a whaaa-ooo-a first in the distance then about fifty yards away we attributed it to the young bear calling for its mother and left reflecting on it later it was unlike any bear sound I’d heard -death cry roar growl nothing I don’t know  it was raining hard so perhaps the sound was distorted.,about three miles west of the intersection of 7 and 8 road north of eight road between eight and four road in wexford county,Wexford County,Michigan,Fall,Report 24695: Disoriented coon hunter is followed out of the woods and experiences possible intimidation near Buckley,44.45835,-85.6667,9/25/2008,24695,Class B,dpghft7ktj,75.6,63.505,51.41,52.71,0.79,0.44,0.88,0,0,,1026.87,Foggy in the morning.,5,5.18,160,0.28

"Yesterday,I ,my dad,my son,and his Friend, went up to our farm in Wilson County to do some bush hogging and prepare our deer stands for the up coming season..The kids asked if they could walk the logging road to see if they could see any deer or turkeys while me and my dad bush hogged the fields. About 20 minutes went by and I see my son and his friend running towards the tractor out of breath..""Dad,i don't care if you believe me or not but what we just saw...I never want to see again!""..His friend said she saw it first. This is the story they have repeatedly told me all afternoon yesterday and this morning- They were walking the logging Rd,and my son started hearing these loud crashes in front of them to the right coming towards them,He said he stopped and felt ""Very uneasy"" about going any further,to which he told his friend ""he wasn't going any farther and she could if she wanted""..She walked around the bend of the road,come walking fast back to him  and says ""There was this thing looking at me behind a tree,swaying left to right,as if to see what she was..It leaned as if to be curious..So, She,not wanting to show it any harm by running or sudden  movement,afraid it would chase her,just turned and walked fast back to my son,and told him ""There is something huge and black standing around the corner""...My son started walking with her and turned back to see if he could see anything and it had came around the corner and was staring at them..He said it was between 7-8ft tall,had blackish/brown,almost like a turkeys feather color when the sun is not shining on its feathers, and had HUGE muscles showing through the fur,he especially notice how broad the shoulders were and how muscular the arms were.At that time they started running as fast as they could until they got to the field i was cutting.. I eventually got in my truck and drove to the spot/area they said this all happened..The woods were a ""dead quiet""..No Tracks were found,i did not smell any foul odor,as i have heard this animal has, plus a storm was approaching so i had to get back and put the tractor up.

"I don't know if this counts, but I talked to my grandfather the other day and he said he had gone up to our property in Monte Cristo. It was kind of late in the day, around 7 p.m. He usually does a perimeter walk of the property when he gets there and on this particular occasion, he had stopped down by the creek. He said he smelled this horrible smell that he had never smelled before. He described it as rotten meat and really bad B.O. He searched around the area and didn't see any tracks because the ground was really rocky. Where he was at, there is a big tree that has fallen over the creek. It's big enough for two people to walk over side by side. My grandfather hopped up on the tree and he said there were droppings right in the middle of it. He said he thought it might be elk droppings, but thought how on earth would an elk get up on this tree. When he told me the story, I told him that there was a bigfoot in his vicinity, that's where the smell was coming from. I read a lot of articles and a lot of people describe almost the same kind of smell. He also stated that our apple tree at the property doesn't have any apples on it anymore, and there are no chokecherries to be seen anymore. We usually have lots of apples and chokecherries. The deer and elk never eat them all. And the only apples they eat are the one's that fall on the ground. The rest are to high up the tree for them to get to.

"At approximately 10 pm one night, my wife and I returned home from a shopping trip. Upon opening the car door and stepping into the gravel driveway I heard a distinct and loud vocalization. It wasn't a howl, not a growl, nothing I had heard before which is what caught my attention. At 31 years old now, 28 then, I had spent my life in the outdoors, locally and abroad. I have never heard anything to match this. My wife asked me what it was and I had to admit I didn't know, but perhaps it was a big cat. But it didn't sound like a cat, and the only cats in the area that are known as 'big' would be bobcats, a big one being 18-29 lbs. I walked inside the house, cutting on the rear porch light, and walked through the house to the front deck where I walked back outside, cutting on the front deck light. I stood at the end of the deck facing east and listened intently. The 'cries' were coming from a ridge in a large woodlot across the railroad tracks behind our house. Our house is situated on 10 acres, and the rear property boundary is the railroad. At that time the nearest house to us, a couple of hundred yards to the east was uninhabited, but the next houses up and across the railroad tracks were. Between cries, I realized I could hear leaves rustling loudly as though two feet were shuffling through them in large strides. When the leaves stopped making noise, an agitated cry was heard. This went on for a minute or two, then the noises came from closer to the neighboring houses, then it started going in the other direction. I probably listened for ten minutes total, until could no longer hear the leaves moving, and howls were coming from farther away. It was mid fall and cold, the sky was clear, no traffic on the road in front of my house which intersects with the railroad maybe a quarter mile down the road. I have labored under the impression that the cries came from some kind of cat, but after listening to the Ohio recording, the cries I heard were frightfully akin to the howls on that recording. They were shorter and sounded more agitated as though something was making the 'issuer' of the cries mad. The large woodlot across the tracks is semi-surrounded by a loose assortment of houses in a neighborhood, which could be easily walked through unseen in the dark. Everything else for surrounding areas is farm pasture and mountain, in fact one mile from my house to the east starts a gravel road running across a mountain into the next county. My inside dogs were whining and agitated, but never offered to bark, then, they rarely do. However neighborhood dogs could be heard barking in the distance, beagles I know for sure and a German Shepherd.","Peppers Ferry Road near Max Meadows, VA",Wythe County,Virginia,Fall,Report 15107: Possible vocalizations heard by a farmer near Max Meadows,37.00085,-80.8797,10/23/2003,15107,Class B,dnw6rxc1w6,51.72,41.02,30.32,31.17,0.59,0.6,0.93,,,rain,1009.92,Mostly cloudy throughout the day.,3,10,286,8.71

Chiswell my friend and me where coming out at dusk when it was getting dark I said, ""we need to go I don't want to be out here at night"" so we were walking down the trail so we get out of the forest, I was feeling very weird at this time because something didn't feel right to me it felt like someone was following as you already know you can tell if someone or something is looking at you, so I let my friend out of the tree line first because I always do that and when I was coming out I heard a crash in the woods it sounded like something crashed down from the tree I turn around and saw a dark figure standing in the trail we just got off of, my friend was 30 ft in front of me when he heard the thing that was in the woods he ran.

"My son (31)  and myself were returning from a fishing expedition  in the Gifford Pinchot Ntl Forest, SW Washington.  All of a sudden, less than 100 yards away, we noticed an entirely black upright creature. Even though we're driving a noisy Cummins Diesel , when we came around the corner, going about 15 mph,  we managed to startle it. It immediately walked fast - didn't run - from the right to the left, up a hill and was gone. Now this whole event didn't take more than 3-4 seconds. We immediately went to the area, and investigated. We found one print that was about 12-13 inches long on the side of the road. This print was made in the somewhat soft silt/gravel that is so common on forest service roads. It only was about 1/4-1/3 deep at best.  Today we're going to try and make a copy of the print. A couple of things about the animal. 1.  It was totally black, like a black bear. It had no facial features that we could detect at all. It didn't appear to have a nose, eyes, mouth or anything, that we could see from the 100 yards we were away. 2.  The animal was in bright sunlight as it crossed the road - there was no mistaking it for a bear - and bears don't have 6 ft strides. 3. The animal appeared to be about 8-8.5 feet tall and slender build. It wasn't the massive muscular specimen I have thought they may be if they exist at all. I would estimate the weight in excess of 400 lbs. 4.  The animal's arms moved in a pedulum manner, like an ape - not like a human.

"My original plans were for a trip to northern California to visit the famous Bluff Creek film site and drop off some casts and pictures to the Willow Creek Museum, arriving on this day, the 35th anniversary of it’s making, October 20th. I had talked with Joe Beelart about this trip, because he had just returned from the area with a party of 10, including Peter Byrne, Todd Neiss, film crew and our own Al Berry and Ron Morehead. Joe talked me out of going there by myself because of the terrain and for safety reasons, so I altered my plans. I decided to divide this trip up into three parts… doing some things and going some places I had been meaning to for a long time. Skookum Meadows revisit, Estacada and the Wynooche river drainage.  I usually make trips like this in search of areas to investigate for longer periods of time at later dates. I do these scouting trips mostly alone and try to cram as much as possible into them.  Oct 19 – Met with Jeff Lemley and his brother around 10:00PM in the Skookum Meadows area to do some late night call blasting. By the time I got there they had already tried a couple of sets. It was quite foggy, but the sound still carried well, with echoes lasting a few seconds after the source stopped. This is the best time to blast out these sounds, late evening, early morning in the fog since the air is quite dense at this time. Interestingly enough, the primates that do use long type calls for communications between members also choose this time of the day to do so.  Jeff and Alan Terry have built themselves quite an impressive sound blasting system. It is modular and has very good output. The sound was clear, I heard no distortion or feedback during the blasts he made. It ran off his car battery. I was quite tired and didn’t last too long sitting outside with Jeff and company in the cold, I crawled back into my truck around 11:30PM and quickly fell asleep. My day job work shift gets me out of bed at 2:30AM and I usually work 10 hour days. I was starting this out all wrong.  Jeff woke me around midnight and said that they were going back home and that they had heard nothing while I was sleeping. I thanked them for meeting with me and bringing the equipment. I watched them leave. I quickly went back to sleep.  Oct 20 – I woke at my usual time – 2:30AM (great!) and started to drive the back roads, visiting the Skookum Meadows Expedition base camp, hill top and ridge top sites as well as the cast site. I wanted to take some measurements, get another average GPS reading after the military eliminated the scramble signal at the cast site and just have a look at the general area during hunting season.  One deer and a lone coyote, evidenced by their tracks had visited the cast site. I collected a soil sample, documented the cast site with pictures, GPS and did some tape measurements.  I found some interesting things traveling around the area this trip:  · A skid mark, looking very much like a human buttock on a road side bank, complete with what might have been hand prints and three impressions that hinted at being bare footprints – 16.5” long x 6” wide at the ball and with toes. · At the exact spot where, during the expedition, I had been filmed looking at some heat tracks on the road with the thermal imager and where I cut open a melon fruit, I found a bee hive, broken in two. It was a natural hive. I couldn't think of why a bear would carry a hive around like this only to suck on it out in the open on a dirt road. There were more large human shaped tracks leading down the road side embankment nearby. · Along the roads, on the side banks, I found 20’ – 25’ fir trees growing half way up. Large human shaped tracks led up to a spot behind these trees and then back down to the road. Some stomping around behind the trees was evident. This lead me to envision something treking up these small slopes, evading night time drivers, returning to the roadway only after passing. · Someone had been leaving fruit...  I photographed these findings and casted a track.","Skookum Meadows area, Big Creek",Skamania County,Washington,Fall,Report 5176: Several sets of tracks found near Skookum Meadows,46.0969,-121.9191,10/20/2002,5176,Class B,c21q1xtjzh,57.87,52.255,46.64,49.88,0.89,,0.48,,,rain,,Clear throughout the day.,0,,345,0.59
"My wife and I were on a family camp out with my inlaws. I stayed up after everyone had gone to bed to let the camp fire burn down. I had noticed earlier that day the dogs would go nuts barking into the woods. Since there were no other campers within miles of us I figured it was deer or some other critter they were barking at. It was after midnight and was quite dark the fire was down to coals. I got this intense feeling that I was not alone, I put it down as over active imagination that feeling you get when you are alone but feel like someone is watching you, so I decided to head for the tent. Some time in the morning between 3:00am and 4:00am I was awakened by what I thought was coyotes howling. It was high pitched. It was not loud at first but grew in intensity, it awakened my wife also, it sounded like one than others joining in. It sounded like five or six animals as it grew in intensity. I knew it was not anything I had heard before. I jumped up thinking it was an alarm and that the woods were on fire but the night was dark and no smoke so we listened to it and could tell it was some sort of animals. I thought it was elk my wife and sister inlaw had spotted a heard down the road earlier that day but I have never heard elk sound like this and if it was they were in pain, as I said it started out low and others joined in and it grew in intensity like it was far away and getting closer it lasted about 10 maybe 15 seconds and then just stop abruptly! It was in unison starting with one than another until it sounded like 5 or 6 going at the same time and then just stopped all at once. It was a very high pitched scream, not a trumpet like an elk or the squeek of a deer and it was not the cry of a cougar. I have heard these animals before and this was new to me. When we were on our way home after the camp out we stopped at the Eagles Cliff store and my wife mentioned what we heard to the girl working there and she said there had been other people that had heard it too and some mentioned having rocks thrown at them out of the dark. I dont know if what I heard was bigfoot. I never believed in the story.

"I had backpacked into Deadman's Lake for a one night stay. It was during the Washington bow season for elk. As I was heading in I ran into two hunters on the trail hunting down to their vehicle to dry out and stay in their camper. They told me that a group had been hunting in the area but had to leave because there horses were acting up. As I got to the lake I could tell that the horses had been kept in a small meadow near the campsite area. I pitched my tent in this area. I was at the lake doing a little fishing before dark when I heard a howl way off in the distance. I didn't think much of it, it was miles away. There were also several bull elk bugling in the hills behind the lake and at one point I could hear some cow elk ""talking"". Being an elk hunter myself, I am very familiar with the sounds elk make during this time of year. That was one of the reasons I had gone to this area was to try to call in and get pictures of the elk. As night fell I stayed up until approximately 9:00 PM listening to the sounds of the woods. I could hear a couple owls hooting back and forth across the lake as I fell asleep. At 11:24 PM I was awoken by the same screaming howl I had heard before but it sounded like it was coming from the meadow I was camped next to, about 50 yards away. It sounded like a cross between a wolf and a very loud human. It sounded as if it were a hailing call. I opened the front flap of the tent and grabbed my light and the only weapon I had, my knife. I also grabbed the camera just in case I could see something. The howl had also scared the two owls I had heard hooting earlier that evening. The owls continued to call back and forth to each other for a time after that but I never heard the howl again. I stayed awake for hours after that and eventually was able to relax and get some sleep. I woke up that morning to the sound of bugling elk and when it got light enough I went to look for any sign of what I had heard the night before. I found a herd of cow elk by the lake but nothing unusual.

"My wife (now-ex) and I were camping at Iron Creek campground, mid summer, and decided to go for a drive.  The exact area cannot be remembered at this time, but it was a couple hours before dark approx 6:30-7:00 P.M., and we were traveling down a dirt road, that inclined and turned slightly to the left, and there was a branch (logging) road that dropped slightly down and to the right as the main road went left.

I had been seeing animals all night so I was really keeping my eyes open. When I slowed down to turn around, my car died.

The screams only went on for a minute or so, but what surprised me was that my father, who has lived in Stevenson his entire life and knows the woods and the local animals well, did not have any idea what was making that sound.  I was 17 at the time, but just recently, my teen age daughter, who has an interest in such matters, played me the 1978 Snohomish County recording of Bigfoot calls, and I have to admit I got a chill from hearing it, because it was, to my recollection, just what I heard on that summer night in August of '78.

"It was early to mid-August when myself and 4 friends decided to camp in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest.  Around dusk, we heard something in the trees near our campsite.  Whatever it was walked through the brush quite loudly.  We figured it was a bear and made noise and scared it away.  Later that night, however, we began to hear some sort of scream.  None of us knew what it was, but we all agreed it was like nothing we've ever heard.  It was very dark and we decided not to try and find out what the noise was, as it was quite some distance away.  Until recently, we still wondered what we heard, but then we listened to vocalizations on this website and heard the same sounds.  What we heard was very similar to the 1978 Snohomish County recording.

"Well, I must admit to being rather surprised to ever find myself to be putting together a ""report"" of big foot activity. With that said, I would like to share with you folks my experience this fall during the 2008 late muzzle loading hunt in Washington state. I saw two different set tracks On two separate days, in different areas of the wind river hunting unit. The below single track was well defined and very recent, as the grass was still coming out of the print whilst I observed it. If I had to guess the print was about 13 to 14 inches long with no instep, five toes and I marveled at how big the big toe was. Anatomically correct in relation to the other toes. Depth was about 3/4 of an inch into the ground. I was well away from the fire roads and still hunting in loops to keep the wind in our favor and to do a complete stalk of the habitat. As I still hunt at a glacial pace I see a lot of game and don't hardly ever disturb the wild life I'm hunting through. I wear dark wool clothes and use the primitive equipment of the fur trade era. My son and I both closely studied the print. I could see less defined impressions leading away by laying on the ground sighting in the direction of travel. As the ground was in a semi frozen state that was softening up after an previous evening of light rain. This was a single print in a remote area well away from the fire roads.

As I still hunt at a glacial pace I see a lot of game and don't hardly ever disturb the wild life I'm hunting through. I wear dark wool clothes and use the primitive equipment of the fur trade era. I was in the south prairie area on the north end of the lava flow. As I had seen a cow and a calf tracks in a area south and east of the area we were in, we planned to return to a  different spot via a circuitous route using the available cover and watch a park like area that isn't easily viewed for the evening hunt. This overlooked a sandy area that was the result of flooding outflow. Laying down a volcanic pumice like sand. I was keeping track of the tracks that went up and down the temporary water bed as it effectively cut the prairie in half making it convenient to get a ""snapshot"" of the previous evenings events. These were all marked and noted each morning when in the area. I was narrowing my hunt down to these two animals. That evening, while looking over the prairie and glassing the adjacent treeline from the cover of a large tree, I heard a knock or thwack about 150 yards out (Since I was elk hunting I thought it was an antler strike). This was about 10 minutes before the end of legal shooting light as I keep close track of my time when finishing out the day's hunt. Optimistic about the next day's scenario already, we headed for the truck assisted with flashlights. Which we did not turn on until we were well away from this spot as we intended to be back in the morning before day break. We also used the available trees and cover to mask our departure as well. Next morning, we returned and set up on the previous evenings spot. After the sun was well up I and my son went out on to the prairie to check the sandy wash for sign. This is where we saw three distinct tracks, one in the sand then two deeper ones about 80 inches apart with the last easily defined print on the other side of an log that I could tell, didn't even break it's stride for. These were identical to yesterdays tracks, size, depth shape etc. I feel that it was the same animal. There are numerous other details, conjecture etc, that I would be happy to discuss now that I am no longer in denial! I am hopeful that this information is of some small help.

"Started on a three day hike in Gifford Pinchot National Forest on 8 Sept 09 at trail head #48 near East Crater.  After the first day of hiking into Indian Heaven Wilderness and spending a cold night at Elk Lake, I decided to hike to a lower elevation near Forlorn Lakes in which I camped on the second night (GPS N45 57.889 W 121 45.536).  I was outside a designated camping site about 200 meters west in a small valley that paralleled road Nf6035.  No one was occupying the camp grounds nearby that night and it was a very quiet night, until I was awaken with what I describe as three consecutive whooping yells followed by a guttural scream that lasted for about 3 seconds.  It was very loud.  Startled, I remember looking at my watch at the time and it was about 0230hrs.  After the whooping calls, I heard very faint distant calls or howling (not whooping).  The source of the scream was definitely coming further up valley I was camped in (maybe 200-300 meters away).  I stayed awake for a couple more hours in my tent and heard nothing more during the night.  I hiked alone for the three days, therefore no further calibration can be offered from another witness.

"My wife and I have a cabin just off the Wind River Hwy on Leete Road for weekend and vacation use. Saturday evening we arrived about 8:00 p.m. and after unpacking the car we walked out to road out front of the cabin, and noticed a very heavy musky skunk like odor. Our brown lab ""Sadie"" caught the scent too and started to look around for it, but it seemed to disappear quickly.

It was then that behind our property to the east in the direction of County Rd 60 I heard three distinct and loud animal calls that made a Whoo-Up! sound. It sounded like a person trying to imitate a bird call. I have never heard a sound like this ever in my life, and I am familiar with several Pacific Northwest animal sounds. This unnearved me a little, and caught the dog's attention. I quickly moved the dog inside the cabin, and had my wife put on her shoes to come outside and listen.

"I was bowhunting for deer yesterday (September 17th, 2005) in the swamp bottoms of West River in Churcton, Maryland when I heard what I can only describe as jibberish hollering coming from behind the deer blind that I was in at about 100 yards or so.  It moved east to west hollering jibberish and moving closer and closer to where I was.  I unzipped the back of the deer blind to try and see with my field glasses what was making all that noise and scaring the deer away.  I saw nothing.  The sound was getting closer and I began to feel nervous even though I had permission to hunt there. Thats when the smell of damp musty roadkill mixed with dirty diapers hit me.  I had to exit the deer blind for fresh air and an overwhelming sense of fear gripped me. It was more of a safety issue that made me exit the deer blind and nock an arrow in my bow and leave the area as fast as I could before I came in contact with whatever was making the noise.  I was unnerved by the aggresive tone in the jibberish and hollering. The fact that it was close by and I could not see it coupled with the smell and the tone of its voice, made me realize that I had best leave the area, and quickly. As I exited the woods, I walked briskly towards my vehicle and was approximately twenty five yards from my truck when I heard more loud jibberish coming paralell from me about twenty yards in the woods.  Whatever it was was following me and that unnerved me even more and I headed straight for my truck with my bow fully drawn and ready to fire at whatever was stalking me.  Again, I saw nothing.  No movement in the woods and I made my way to my truck and released my draw without shooting my arrow.  I put my bow in the back seat of my Suburban and cranked up my truck and left immediately.

"I am a 44 yr. old woman, I am submitting this in request of my husband & grown son.  As an avid 'birder' (loves bird watching), I was taking an early morning walk (6:45 a.m.) around Oxbow Lake to see what birds were 'out & about'. Almost as soon as I started the short trail around the lake, I noticed that there was no activity.....none, no birds, no deer, no squirrels, nothing. This seemed VERY odd to me, because it was a beautiful spring morning, the sun was shining and there wasn't even the smallest breeze in the air. Then I noticed that the birds weren't even singing, I could not hear one bird song or call, which is very unusual because there is ALWAYS a lot of bird activity here, especially in the early morning. Then, I noticed that not even the frogs, or the peepers were making any sound...it was complete silence. When I reached the part of the trail where I usually see deer, there was nothing. It was just about in this area where I started to smell this terrible odor....hard to explain, a strong musky smell, not like a dog or a skunk but a definite heavy odor of musk, one I have never smelled before and I have spent a lot of time in the woods. While I was standing quietly trying to figure out what/where the odor was coming from, a live tree 30-40 ft. high (unknown species) fell about 100-150 ft. from me, it just fell, and there was not even a small breeze that day! I have spent my childhood in the deep woods of Adirondack Mountains. and this just went against every natural law I could think of.....and believe me I tried to rationalize this! I then had this intense feeling that I was being watched...no more like being stared at, and then I got the sense that perhaps the tree had been pushed, like a warning. I decided I should start making my way back towards my car, still not hearing or seeing ANY wildlife. Just before getting back in my car I went to an overlook and all of a sudden I heard from the opposite side of the lake a loud howling, it echoed thru the marsh area.

"In mid spring of this year, I was hiking through the woods with a friend in the middle of the night. Making our way up onto a trail, we stumbled upon a picnic table and decided to sit down and rest. We were startled to find the whole ground glowing green around us. Using my headlamp, we attempted to spot whatever was causing these little glowing green dots. At the time we had no clue what was causing this to happen, but we later realized that firefly larvae were lighting up the forest floor. Seeing the glows coming more intensely from a nearby hillside deeper in the woods, we decided to scan the the hillside with our headlamp. As soon as we shined the headlamp, we caught a pair or grapefruit sized bright green (with a slight hint of gold) eye reflections peering over the crest of the hill. We stood in shock, never removing the light from those eyes. ""Maybe its a deer,"" she said. A few moments later the eyes raise up to be about 5 off the ground and rotate slightly more towards us. ""See,"" I say, ""It is just a deer."" As soon as that last word leaves my mouth the eye reflections stand up another 4 feet to be standing at a towering 9 feet. It slowly occurred to be that I had never seen eye reflections of this color and that the closest thing might be a bear. Suddenly I hear a slight rustling behind me. Swinging the light around we caught the reflections of two more sets of eyes. They too were grapefruit sized and green, but were spookily sneaking up on us from behind. I get caught in a frenzy of shinning the light back and forth between all three sets of eyes until they just quietly disappear. we hurried out of the area, terrified, and made our way south to a different hiking area to take the whole situation in. Again we noticed firefly larvae, but when we began to approach the woods (which in fact are connected to the last area by water system) a bunch of creatures began running around in the woods, breaking branches and shaking bushes and trees. Later, upon watching one of your videos and discussing the experience with some knowledgable peers, I realized that I had experienced a sasquatch encounter.

"I was using the outhouse right after I had woken up at about 9 in the morning.  I was in the outhouse when I heard a rustling of leaves and sticks breaking.  This wasn't unusual as we have a lot of deer near our house.

"Ontonagon Michigan in the Upper Peninsula July 20th 2002 First, I should tell you that I am a scientist. For this reason I would like to remain anonymous but thought it would be of value to report my experience. My wife and daughter and I were staying at a friends newly built cabin up in the Michigan UP.  The cabin is on the shore of lake Superior in a desolate area on a dirt road not too far away from the nearest town.  I was amazed by the quietness of the forest area and the very tall pine tree stands.  At 9:30 PM my wife was reading a story to my daughter in bed and I was laying on a mattress right next to the window.  All of a sudden I heard Whoooop  Whoooop, long pause, Whoooop, Whoooop, long pause, Whoooop, Whoooop.  The pitch was rising from low to high.  The first thing that went through my mind was “what the hell is that?”  The sound came from a thick area of pine trees to the west of the property.  The next thing I noted was  the incredible volume of the sound.  Even though it was probably 150 yards away, it was so loud that it echoed off of the trees.  To me it was a very “zoo sound,”  It sounded so much like a primate that it gave me chills.  The vocalization sounded almost exactly like the “whooping” on the Sierra sounds webpage. Up until that moment, bigfoot had not crossed my mind at all. Let me add that I have had about 25 years of experience hiking, camping and fishing in the Sierras and throughout the country and I had never heard a sound like that.  It clearly was not an owl, bear, loon, coyote or moose.  I have heard similar sounds on the internet as well. There are multiple creeks and swampy areas as well as lots of blueberries.  There are thick stands of pine trees. It had rained earlier in the day.  Some of our group were out picking blueberries during the day, I was out fishing that day on a nearby river and in lake Superior. I’m aware that there was credible sighting in 1998 by a bear hunter on the Firesteel river in Greenland county less than 5 mi away from the cabin that I was staying at.  Also, there is an account of an Ontonagon logger who claimed that 2 bigfoots rescued him from under a fallen log.  Those 2 incidents  got me thinking that there may be some reality to what I heard. The thought of the existence of another bipedal primate is a shock to most people, including me. I did not make an effort to investigate the area where the noises came from in the morning.  Partly because we were busy taking care of small children and I was not prepared to have an encounter.  Next time I go to the UP I’ll keep my camera ready.",Edited.,Ontonagon County,Michigan,Summer,Report 5137: Scientist hears nocturnal vocalizations near Ontanagon.,46.87111,-89.31389,7/20/2002,5137,Class B,f026xses58,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Myself And my friend were leaving a venue in the country. The location is mears, mi. We were driving down this curvy rd going roughly 30 mph. It was roughly midnight. I do know the exact location. My friend was driving and all of the sudden he says "" dude, what is that in the rd?"" we got roughly 20 ft from the object and my friend turned on his high beams. When he did this the thing stood up in the middle of the rd and then ran very quickly up a hill. There is no doubt that it was either a Sasquatch or someone in a very large big foot suit. It ran up the hill on two feet and it looked like a kind of ""skip"" like a ape. Could not be a bear. There were other people that weekend that claimed to see it also. I am very certain of what we saw. I have looked on the internet and there are quite a few sightings in this area.

"I was deer hunting in the Rifle River State Park in Michigan. I was on the west border of the park about 300 yards from the southern border. I had walked into the area from the south and stopped to ""let the forest quiet"". I watched as three female deer crossed my path about 75 yards north of me. They were stopping and looking back to the west as they moved to the east. I thought that a buck would be sure to follow. What I saw was a figure that walked silently through the woods. It seemed to be a very large man in a fur coat. I thought,what a fool to be out in the woods in a fur coat and no hunter's orange during deer season! I had on an orange hunting coat and hat. As I stood up, the ""man"" turned to face me. It was then that I realized that this may not be a man. It turned and ran in the direction that it had come. I could not believe how quiet it ran through the woods. I have been hunting for over 50 years and have spent many days in the wilderness at a time but I have never seen such an animal. I have never seen any large animal move so quietly. I have hunted bear, moose, whitetail deer, wild boar, and moose. Never had any of these animals moved through the woods without making a sound. In fact, I had heard the three deer well before I saw them. When I got back to camp, I mentioned this incident to a guy that has hunted the area for decades. I only told him that I saw a guy in a fur coat. He seemed to be a little concerned about going back to the area. I have not hunted that area again. This animal was about 6'8"", had a grey/brown hair and seemed to have arms that were longer than a human's. It walked upright but not as a man would and not as a chimp or other primate that I know of would. There seemed to be white hair around the face and on the chest. The more that I think about it, I am convinced that it was trailing/hunting those deer. It was the rut and those does would be in heat.

"I never believed in these sort of things until 4 years ago. I live just outside of a small Michigan village of Marion MI, me and my sister were at the bus stop.

"My boyfriend was driving me and some friends through  a wooded area near Mio, Michigan. It is some dirt roads to the left of 33(This was my first time to this part so I am not certain, exactly where I was).  We were cruising along looking at the woods that had been recently burned down. Down the road right after this hill, my boyfriend and I both saw a white figure crossing the road. Jokingly he says ""there is sasquatch"", we both just assumed it was a human since it was walking upright across the road. I was unsure how how big it was since we were far down the road. When we got over the hill, I made a reference to seeing something and figuring it was a human wondering why there wasnt a car in sight. We then began talking about how strange this whole thing was. We went back to the area we saw him crossing the road and looked for footprints but the road didnt show prints. We speculated on the reasons for someone being in the deserted woods. Needless to say, we drove around in circles for an hour looking. I had the weirdest feeling in my stomach knowing I saw something different. I did not really think I saw a sasquatch until I came home and did a little research.","I am unsure, but I can get them from my friend if needed",Oscoda County,Michigan,Summer,Report 15150: Possible daylight sighting by backwoods motorist couple near Huron National Forest,44.53665,-84.16389,7/9/2006,15150,Class B,dpujkg9sz1,84.04,69.12,54.2,60.6,0.69,0.5,0.44,0.0183,1,rain,1011.61,Rain starting in the evening.,9,9.41,232,4.94
"Back in 1992 I was bear hunting with a buddy of mine in the area around the town of Lewiston. We had 4 bear bait sites in about a 30 mile radius. One of the sites was located in Red Oak Township. Every time we would go to this site I had this strange feeling like I was being watched or something. It was spooky. One day just before bear season started I was checking this particular bait pile alone. There was a two track road that wound through the woods up a hill and then down to a swamp. The two track ended at a trail which I would park at the head of and then walk down with two 5 gallon buckets of bear bait which usually consisted of meat scraps and pastries. On this particular day I had just dumped the bait on the bait pile and was walking up the path to my truck. The cover was fairly thick but thined out the closer you came to the two track. I was about 60 yards in from the two track and could see it when something very strange happened. I creature of some sort I would say about 7 to 8 feet tall walked across the two track. This creature crossed the two track in one step. I have seen bears and run across bears in the woods before but I can say for sure this was definitely not a bear. I was so startled that I just stopped in my tracks and said to myself, ""what in the he** was that?"" I walked closer to where the creature crossed I kept getting the overwhelming feeling of fear. When I got to the spot where I thought this creature had crossed I stopped and looked in the direction in which the creature had walked looked. about 30 feet or so behind a large cedar tree I could make out what appeared to be a a face which was defintly not a bear but not a man either. It looked kind of black like a mountain gorilla would. I thought I was seeing things so I kind of blinked a few times but it was still there after about 15 seconds the creature turned away from me and disappeared into the woods. All the time this was happening I just could not shake this feeling of dread or doom. I have hunted and fished all over the state of Michigan and have never been afraid of anything that I have encountered but this really shook me. I can best describe the creature as about 7 to 8 feet tall very dark in color and like I stated previously had a face that looked like a cross between a man and a gorilla. I have never seen anything that even came close to this. Up until now I was a non-believer in Bigfoot. I always figured that what people were seeing was bears walking on there back legs. This was NOT a bear and it was not a man either. I never told anyone about this for years. I did not think anyone would believe me and I did not want to listen to my hunting buddies tease me about it.",It was off of a dirt road near F97.,Oscoda County,Michigan,Fall,Report 24868:  Hunter tells of his daylight encounter while baiting bear outside Lewiston,44.76,-84.12485,10/12/2008,24868,Class A,dpuntsq1uu,78.66,65.955,53.25,50.59,0.71,0,0.42,0,0,,,Clear throughout the day.,4,10,185,1.42
"Im 41 and have hunted this area in Northern Michigan a lot, First let me begin with what I have seen several times in an area That I have Bird hunted 100s of times.. For years I have hunted grouse along a cedar swamp that runs along a farmers field, there is a spot where i have found numerous bones and some kind of scat, I thought it was a coyote that was feeding on the farmers cows or an area were a coyote would drag deer( I'm not sure what kind of bones but they looked like cow or deer) The grouse would often flush from the trees so I just figured a coyote or bear was in the area a lot.. the area is a straight shot and it runs about 2 miles and has alot of downed trees and is really an ankle break type of hunt lots of stumps and holes where tress have been uprooted.. Last week while hunting I noticed what I thought was a dead bear about 30 yards to my right( I only looked in that direction because of very foul odor), it was hairy and just laying there, it looked out of place and had no movement . the area I hunt is very moist and soft so you can be very quiet.. Just to make sure it wasn't a wounded bear I grabbed a fallen tree limb and started hitting a tree. what ever this was looked in my direction and jumped to its feet( it was standing upright) it really got up in a hurry and made a quick exit and it was running upright away from me. . the noise it made running through the woods was a very loud crashing so I knew it was a very large animal.. after the sighting I went over to where it was laying and noticed a large bedding area that had ground dug up and a fallen tree to the east of the bed or resting area .. it was the last day of my hunt I took a few pictures with my camera phone but the images didnt come out very clear.. My next trip up to that area is in 10 days so I plan on taking more quality pictures.. Im not sure what I saw it could have been a wounded bear that was hit with an arrow that couldn't use its front legs( I didn't see any blood) but it was upright and it looked like a "" Bigfoot"" .. I'm still a little shook up about the whole thing and I'm embarrassed to tell anyone.. My gut tells me it was not a bear my head tells me it wasnt a ""bigfoot"" sorry if this story isnt what your looking for.. I wrote this story about a month ago and was embarrassed to submit it, The more I thought about what I saw the more I can remember looking at it and expecting to see a bear  ,it was puzzling to expect to see a bear and then you see something you cant explain .. Ive asked myself a 1000 times could this have been a bear, maybe it hurt its front legs and was forced to try to escape on its hind legs..  But it moved to fast and navigated around tress to easy for it to be a wounded bear..  then when It looked at me I expected to see a long face of a bear but it wasn’t .. The one thing I noticed more then anything is it had a very large rear end.. I haven't been back but when I do go back  I will take pictures of the area..  still kind of shook up about the whole experience and I try to relive the encounter over and over again in my mind..  I haven't told anyone and I doubt I will, its a very big part of my life now and seriously has put me in a very bad state of mind with many questions.

"I had went for the evening to relax in the nearby harbor (Presque Isle) to have dinner and then drove up to the New Presque Isle Lighthouse and parked my car.  I walked thru a clearing of trees (east) from the lighthouse towards Lake Huron.  It was a full-moon, clear night with very little waves on the lake.  I had been at this location for around :30 minutes to about :45 minutes and had been wading out in the water to just cool off.  I was in shorts/t-shirt and flip-flops as it was summer.  After I decided that it was time to leave I started to go back towards my car and subsequently dry off.  As I was walking back thru the same clearing that I had come from earlier I could hear some motion in the trees to my left.  I remember also it was very still/quiet that night while on foot.  At different times I heard what sounded like large (or fairly large) twigs snapping on or near the ground and thought maybe it was a deer of some sort, probably not a bear I didn't think. Sometimes it would be one or two twigs/branches snapping, other times it was multiple snaps which would occur quite quickly as if perhaps (at the time) whatever it was had some good size weight to itself. I had the distinct impression (or sense) that I was being watched and it made me feel quite un-easy, I had a more sense of urgency at this point of just wanting to get to my car and leave.  Also at other times I heard what sounded like whole trees being moved or pushed somewhat out of the way, I was puzzled as it implied to me that something was off in the trees that had a fairly good size body mass.  As I continued on towards the end of the clearing, the sound would parallel (or stay) with me--it wasn't getting distant or going away from my vantage point of where I first starting hearing the commotion going on.  After I had gotten into my car I felt hugely relieved but couldn't still necessarily understand why.  I remember too, that I was constantly looking around ""over my shoulder"" very intently but figured it was more than likely a small animal and no big deal.  As I drove off (about maybe--?  50-100 yards) as I had already turned on the radio and was feeling pretty relaxed I noticed from off the left side of my car (from the headlights shining onto some of the trees and roadway) a large black, furry looking figure standing completely in the front of the tree line looking dead, straight at me with some powerful--menacing eyes.  (The eyes followed me as I went past).  It completely shocked me, I slammed on the brakes of my car and just sat in the middle of the road for around half a minute (or less) and was trying to figure out (rationalize/take in) what I had just seen.  It stood around I would say between 7'-8' feet tall and it's arms were unusually long.  More than anything, the face is what spooked me and I remember the most as it closely resembled that of a man--the nose was flat and it stood completely erect, was not slouched or bent over--exactly still.  The head looked like it was just perched onto some huge shoulders, the shoulders were massive going across and the upper torso was quite impressive.  I decided it would be best to just keep going as I had thought about of maybe turning the car around and shine my high beam lights into the tree line (to see if I could spot it again) but decided this probably would not be in my best interest.  I went on and headed back to Alpena where I had come from originally.  I was never so glad to see ""city lights"" again until I reached the north end of town while on U.S.-23.

"While attending a family hunting trip, several of us were walking on a two track north of our camp.  We were almost a quarter mile from camp, climbing a steep portion of the road. Suddenly, the four of us stopped dead in our tracks.  At the top of the two track, a large, dark figure stood in the middle of the road staring at us. The thing was quite tall, and very broad across the chest.  The arms were longer than a man, and it seemed frozen as it looked at us.

"This incident occurred in late September or early October in 2002.  I was living in Seney at the time and working in Manistique in the U.P. of Michigan.  I would take the Manistique river road to work every day to try and bag a couple of partridge on the way in.  This is a gravel road that runs along the river from Germfask to Manistique.  On this day, I left early and drove slowly for about the first half of the road.  I had shot one bird, and chased another into the popples a way, and realized that I was close to being late. I cased up my shotgun and jumped in the car and put the hammer down in the 1991 Ford Fiesta.  About 45mph is pretty fast on this road, but I had driven it many times.

I saw movement on the left in the pines, and slowed down thinking to avoid hitting a deer. About 30 to 40 yards ahead of me I saw what can only be described as a sasquatch approach the road, then pause and look in my direction, and apparently, change his mind and turn and run parallel to the road in the direction I was travelling.  This scared the s*** out of me.  I slowed down but was scared to stop, and I didn't want it to jump me in the small car, so I jammed brakes, and reversed a couple hundred yards.  I took my single shot 20 ga. out of the case and loaded it with birdshot.  Still scared to go back in the direction I was headed, I sat there for about 2 to 3 minutes, until a pickup truck with another hunter approached from the same direction I had come.  I let him pass and then followed him on through to Manistique.  As I passed the area where the sasquatch had been I looked for sign, but saw none.  I have never told anyone about this until recently, when a friend of mine told me of a similar occurrence that had happened to his aunt.

"I was on vacation with my family at Gulliver Lake in Scoolcraft county MI in the Upper Peninsula. Me and my sister would usually take a walk after dinner. The path we would always take was Gulliver lake road ( I believe) next to the lake that looped back to our fathers cabin. Next to the lake was a wooded area that went uphill then on the other side was large sand dune. We went out later than usual so it was completly dark outside, a moonless night save a few lightpoles. As we passed the lake and made left to the other side of the wooded area where the dunes were my sister heard something but at the time she did not say anything. As we kept walking my sister would say to me that something was following us on our left side behind the treeline. We stopped to listen I thought i heard something move but was not sure.

"I noticed that you are doing an expedition in the U.P. of Michigan.  My husband and I go to his families cabin in Wetmore which is in Schoolcraft County on the Chain of Lakes.  In June of 2006 we were standing out on the deck at around 10:30 and we both heard from across the lake back somewhere in the woods (it sounded like the area of Pine Marten Run Trail) a loud grunt/howl sound.  It sounded exactly like the calls from your website. Then again this June 2007 we were up there again and there was another sound that was loud and it sounded like muffled talking.  It sounded like something was trying to talk but not using English words.  We were both pretty startled. Then that same trip we went searching for a particular lake in Schoolcraft county, we found it and went down a road marked site 2.  I was looking around and my husband was fishing down at the lake.  He called me down there and there was a very large human shaped foot print where the sand met the grassy area.  I put my foot in the track and it fit but it was just much bigger.

"My son-in-law and I were hunting across from Clear Lake a few miles off Hwy 94 next to Green Lake. We were running our hounds on coon that night. There is a lot of country past Green Lake up into the Hickey Marsh and eventually the Seney. I had noticed partridge remains where we parked. I didn't think about. The hounds were gamey right out of the box. I cut a young hound and proven hound in. Both with a lot of grit. When they struck I had the feeling we weren't running coon but rather a bobcat. It took about twenty minutes and they treed. We proceeded into the dogs and right before the tree the critter bailed. Cats bail when they see lights like bear do at night when we run them. The dogs pulled tree and gave chase again. Treeing deeper. Way deeper. My son-in-law went to the truck to holler me out if needed. I kept the the tracker with me. I'm now in marsh with a mixture of spruce, cedar, bog and popple. The dogs treed deep. I went to a high spot to vantage my hearing on them. A thick wooded ridge. My radio tracker could barely read them and barely read the extra collar at the truck. Its range in wooded areas is about 7 miles. I kept swinging it around slowly trying to gain a good reading. I could smell something foul but thought it was myself after falling in swamp muck on more than one occasion. Again while swinging my tracker my coonlight in the direction of the antenna I noticed in the spruce a set of eyes next to the deer run on this ridge. Coon hunting you see a lot of different eye shine. I shrugged and swung the tracker, when I swung back into the trail toward the truck the trail was filled with animal twenty feet in front of me. It was around 8 feet tall long arms with fingers, barrel chested and pot bellied. The eyes were close and deep set but aggressive in its gaze, the mouth was agap. My goodness the ears were small. I froze in my tracks, I lost my training of the hounds call. We just looked at each other frozen. It grabbed a very large spruce, wrapping its hand around it. Its hair was black to brown not long, not short, the nose flat, with a face not covered in hair like its body. I really don't remember how it left. I remember the smell followed me almost all the way to the truck just up a trail where my son-in-law met me. He commented I passed gas jokingly. I was very shaken. I had a hard time reading my tracking system on the way back, I doubted my compass. It wasn't the straightest path back. To this day I haven't ran the hounds up there for or or bear since. As well it was the only time I left my hounds in the woods. In the morning after sleeping a bit I rode up {nervous as hell } to try and find the hounds by myself as my son in law went to work.

I thought it was a germiln or a baby bigfoot.  I didn't want to see it up close because I was too scared.  It was maybe about 3 to 4 feet tall and it was runing with long arms swaying back and forth.  Also it ran like the hunch back of Notre Dame.

While hunting in the Pinckney State Recreation Area during the last week of deer season my hunting partner and I heard loud whooping or howlling type noises similar to those heard in recordings on this site along with bi-pedal type foot steps through heavy brush. The sound of the foot steps were very heavy and we could hear branches breaking as it moved around.  My partner and I were a few hundred yards apart and the noise came from a thick cover between our spots.  We both heard it as my partner called me on the two way asking if I could hear it too.  I don't know that it was a bigfoot however it was scarry enough for me to remove the safety from my gun and actually swing in the direction it came from knowing my partner was in that direction as well.

"To begin with, I'm not sure what I saw, but it was something I couldn't identify, so I thought this might be the right forum to approach it. During the summer of 1993, my brother and I were looking for Lake Superior Agates along the shore of Lake Superior about 3-4 miles west of the mouth of the Two-Hearted River.  It was mid-afternoon on a windy and overcast day.  When looking for agates you spend much of your time looking at the ground, but occasionally stand up to stretch your back and  look down the beach.  It was during one of these times I noticed a figure some 300-500 yards down the beach standing at the tree line in the direction from which we'd been walking.  My first instinct was that it was another agate hunter and I voiced this to my brother stating that we now had ""competition"". As I watch the figure I noticed that it did not bend over (which is typical of agate hunters) nor did it move from its position at the tree line. It was at this time I realized the stature of the figure when I compared it to the nearby pines.  I then asked my brother to retrieve my binoculars from by day pack on my back, because that was the ""tallest person"" I'd ever seen and wanted to take a closer look. I also thought I might be catching a rare glimpse of a bear.  Instead of handing me the binoculars, by brother observed the figure through them first.  When I asked him if it was a man, he said he couldn't tell, but it was ""a man-like figure"".  He then gave me the binoculars to get my opinion.  On looking at the figure through the glasses it was magnified considerably, though I could discern no color variations.  The figure was completely black.  I observed the figure walk from the tree line to the shoreline a number of times, but could not distinguish what it was doing exactly.  At one point the figure began walking towards us and made both my brother and myself quite nervous.  By this time we realized we may be seeing something extraordinary.  The figure cut another 100 yards between us in a very short period of time, but still no discernable color variations where you would expect to find them.  At this point, I observed the figure bend down and pick up a beach rock and toss it into the lake (underhand).  It was at this point when I decided it was a man and told my brother this based solely on the fact that it tossed a rock into the lake.  This seemed to satisfy both of us and we continued our rock hunting ignoring any subsequent activities of the figure. In retrospect, I believe we were so quick to identify the figure as human because we had to return to camp in the same direction and the alternative to the figure being human was unacceptable.  We did not look for prints on our way back nor did we discuss the incident until some days later (there was no reason to do these things, because we had resigned ourselves to identify the figure as human).  A few days later, we were conveying the story to a relative jokingly referring to it as our ""bigfoot story"".  When our relative asked us ""why wouldn't a bigfoot throw rocks"", we realized we may have identified it as human too quickly and unfortunately may have missed more detailed identification through the investigation of footprints.","End of County Road 412, about 3-4 miles west of the mouth of the Two-Hearted River",Luce County,Michigan,Summer,Report 475: Rock hunters watch tall upright figure along Lake Superior near Newberry,46.71195,-85.38834,7/15/2005,475,Class B,f0738zwhg6,88.89,73.555,58.22,56.35,0.59,0.15,0.29,0,0,,,"Partly cloudy starting in the afternoon, continuing until evening.",8,10,175,2.19
"My Grandson (11 years old at the time) and I were hunting for deer in the back end of the Clay Bank swamp, this time on the north end of it, opposite of my earlier encounter, when it was getting twilight we decided to call it a day, picked up our equipment and started a slow walk back to my truck, only got about 50 yds when a 6 point buck ran within 20 feet to the front of us, and about 6 feet behind the deer was a sasquatch chasing him, it had its arms outstretched to grab the deer, it was black and in the 8 ft area, really big.  As the creature was directly in front of us it looked at us, it was as surprised as we were, the deer continued on to the south west, the creature headed south east at that point into the pines, hard woods, hemlock and ceders, it was out of sight in about 15 seconds, they seem to be able to hide from sight pretty easy.  My Grandson turned to me and said,""Holy crap Grandpa did you see that big black thing?"" all I could say was ""yup"",  and again the safety was taken off on my rifle as we walked the rest of the way out.  My Grandson wanted to take a peek and see if we could see it again, but we didn't.  To the east south east of us is a clear cut field which is the direction it headed in, and to the east of us is a jackpine plantation.  I feel the creature only went as far as it needed to be out of our sight, and probably to continue his hunt for venison after we were gone.  We were back in the same spot the next morning at my Grandson's request, he was unafraid when he was with me, and against my better judgement we went back to same spot.","Glen Oak Rd is directly across M 55 from where we park off road, we go in about 150 yds south and then take an old two track to the west for about 300 yds or so.",Manistee County,Michigan,Winter,"Report 30090: Grandfather and grandson witness a big, black creature chasing a deer near Manistee",44.22671,-86.10172,11/15/2009,30090,Class A,dpfg8enxk8,43.3,34.935,26.57,32.42,0.7,0.42,0.96,,,rain,1019.18,Mostly cloudy until afternoon.,2,10,327,6.5

"Hello , my name is shawn age 26 . I just heard about the BFRO today from my mother who told me right away about this bigfoot investigation team coming to marquette and this subject is something im very passionate about especially after an encounter my bestfriend erik and i had a couple years ago , the only people i ever told was some family and ofcouse discussing with my buddy over the years since . So the night it happend was i believe in 2004 and sometime in late january . we were driving on the back road  just past Acocks Sanitarium on a dirt road that goes up to the right and heads back to some railroad tracks and LOTS of woodland . well it was between 9 and 10 and we very board and trying to find new places where we could snowboard so we decided to pull over there and walk up the road and see if we could find some good size hills back there . we got a couple flashlights out of my buddys car and started walking up the road past the gate . not even about 300 feet away from the gate we heard a strange sound but didnt think anything of it so we kept walking . i noticed what looked like very large prints in the snow to my right and right away thought it was from someone on snowshoes but even though it was late at night there was quite a bit of light out so even with the flashlights not on the prints you could see clearly they were to far apart in stride so this struck erik and i . we shined our lights closer on them and realized they were NOT from a snowshoer but there was clearly shaped FOOT prints , toes and all . it was very warm that day and even that night was pretty nice so i kept telling myself there is no way that its a bigfoot print and was telling myself that maybe the snow had melted a bit and made a footprint look larger but then i realized ok thats silly because its an actual FOOT print , clear as day and why would someone walk around the snow in bare feet and who would have feet that are that big . my flashlight was 12 inches long and i put it alongside it and the print was still quite larger than that and very wide . erik had a disposible camera in his car so i ran down and grabbed it and i even took a picture of the print . the stride on it also was very far apart , i walked in the snow next to it and i had to seriously spread my legs out far just to come close to the stride of these prints . i would almost have to run and leap to make those strides . so that really got me thinking and so erik and i were standing there discussing this whole thing not beliveing that it was real and not even 5 minutes after talking a huge tree across the road and down a little bank about 20 feet from us started shaking violently and the snow was falling off it and branches breaking so erik started running back towards the car and i followed . we sat in the car for a minute to just gather ourselfs of what it could have been and till this day we swear by what we saw . this is the first time ive ever wrote of this . and i just gotta say i think your BFRO is a great thing and i know someday bigfoot will be proven true .","im not sure as to the exact name of the road but if you go past lost creek apartments and keep following that road until you get to where it says Acocks where there used to be a sanitarium . keep going past that and its the next right , there is a road going up a little hill and there will be a gate . just about 300 feet from that to the right is where we seen the prints in the snow .",Marquette County,Michigan,Winter,Report 19936: Possible footprints found in snow outside Marquette,46.52545,-87.5034,1/22/2004,19936,Class B,f03b8v9yqu,-0.62,-2.415,-4.21,-10.09,0.66,0.87,0.04,,,snow,,Mostly cloudy throughout the day.,1,6.25,301,13.8
"On Jan.18, 2007 at about 17:35 my wife and I decided to go out into the woods looking for deer and enjoying the snow in our 4 wd truck. We were driving along and we decided to take a DNR access road. Nothing unusual was noticed as we drove along down to the lake other than the the lack of deer tracks that normaly criss cross the area. There had been a recent snow and the area around the lake was for the most part lacking any signs of movement except for a single set of  tracks  leading up from a bowl like depression and passing by the toilet building.  My wife pointed to them and asked me what kind of animal would make that track, when I looked over I noticed that the tracks were that of  something walking upright on two legs.  I stopped the truck and got out to look closer the snow depth is around 18 to 20 inches.  The length between the strides I would estimate to be between 45 to 50 inches the interesting thing was that the tracks were clean in that there were no drag marks  just a clean stride.  When I went to examine them there were a lot of drag mars left by me  and a few slips in the deep snow, my stride fell short by some 20 or so inches as I tried to match the stride.  I was unable to determine if there were any toe prints but the prints looked a bit irregular at the front of them.  The single set of tracks  continued up a trail and into a stand of pines.

"About 2 years ago, sometime during warm weather, my husband and I were sleeping with our window open.  It was very early morning, and my husband was startled awake by a very high pitched screaming sound.  I was awakened just a few moments later by the same sound.  It sounded like a terrified woman, or a child's high pitch scream.  My husband was very scared, as he thought it was our 3 year old daughter that had climb out of her window and was walking on the dark road.  He ran downstairs to check on her and found her and our 2 year old son asleep in their rooms.  While he was checking on them, I heard the scream again.  My husband and I had never heard that sound before.  It gave us chills.  The next day, curiosity got a hold of me.  I started searching online for that sound, and came across supposed Bigfoot screams.  It sounded the exact same.  We even looked up screech owl noises, and many of the other noises that people have said this scream is.  Although the noises came close, nothing matched exactly, except the supposed Bigfoot screams.  That was the last we heard of those noises until recently.  The current situation is actually happening at my dad's house, which is about 2 miles if you take the road, and maybe 1-1.5 miles straight shot, from our house.  He moved to that house about 3 months ago.  A few weeks or so after he moved into the house, he told me one morning that he heard this screaming sound the night before that he had never heard before, and that it gave him chills.  I jokingly said that it was Bigfoot.  Well, one day I was watching Finding Big Foot at my dad's house, and he heard the sound that the cast had heard in the woods, and MM said was a Bigfoot.  He came into the room and said, ""that's the sound I heard, what was that?""  -He did not know the name or content of the show I was watching.  My dad has said that a few times since, he has heard that same sound.  He also said that his dog, who is a lab mix, usually starts growling and the hackles on his back stand up, when there are animals, such as deer, in the backyard or in the woods across the river.  However, he said there are times when the dog acts like he hears something in those areas, and will run back into the house and hide.  There has also been one time, about 12:30 at night, my husband was letting our dogs outside, and he came into the house, at little scared, and said that he had heard that sound again.  The next morning, my dad told us that he heard the scream again, about 12:30 at night, and we told him that we had heard it too.  The latest ""event"" and the reason that I reached out to MM, was because my dad had our kids over at his house on Monday (5/14) evening.  Earlier that day, he had taken a few panoramic pictures of his backyard as he was playing with his dog.  My kids went over to his house around 7pm.  He had them outside most of the evening, in and out, and then they ate dinner.  Sometime around 9pm, my dad noticed a very large limb sticking straight out of the ground on the bank of the river. He looked back at the picture he took earlier and the stick was not there. The stick is probably around 9'-10' tall.  It was in the ground approximately 9"".  I have attached two pictures showing this.  I am in the picture, and I am about 5'6"".   My husband got to my dad's house about 15 minutes after my dad noticed the stick.  He started walking down to the stick, and had a very uneasy feeling, and only made it half way between the house and the river, when he heard a rustling sound in the woods across the river. That was when he turned around and walked back to the house.  I got to the house about 15 minutes after that, and my husband and I walked down the the stick to look for footprints and found nothing.  My husband mentioned that he did not have the uneasy feeling that time.  We looked around and tried to see if maybe the limb had fallen from the tree, and while this is a possibility, I feel it is very unlikely.  The conditions would have had to be perfect for this to happen.  My dad said the next morning, that he thinks that the limb probably fell from the tree, but I'm not convinced.",(Removed),Mecosta County,Michigan,Spring,Report 35437: Family reports possible vocalizations and unexplained activity near Mecosta,43.577,-85.293,5/14/2012,35437,Class B,dperghgw3j,75.81,59.29,42.77,36.61,0.52,0,0.81,0,0,,,Clear throughout the day.,9,10,247,2.24
"My brother was driving home in the approximate area of  (removed), Monroe, Michigan in a Geo tracker passing sporadic farm houses and other homes otherwise it was pretty dark. The area is semi rural and lighting is poor in some areas. It was approximately 11-11:30 p.m., the night before trash pickup, and many folks had their cans out front of their properties on this particular night.  As he approached a curve my brother who says he’s never spoke about this to his family and only to a close personal friend, observed what he thought was a bear or a very large black dog on all fours in the distance. From the lights of headlamps he said the big black dog appeared to be rooting in the trash and paused only as it caught a glimpse of his approaching headlights. Rounding the curve and heading straight forward he says the black object became clearer and larger as he approached. When he continued forward the animal then on all fours rises on two feet towering above his tiny Geo tracker. It was approximately 7-8 feet tall, black and hairey and looked like it had an ape face with its mouth open as he passed by. My brother said it was so big, so unnatural, it was almost traumatizing. The experience was an unforgettable shock to him. He says as he came side by side with the creature he had to force himself to not look at it as he sped past. As I mentioned he would not report this sighting and does not about it in front of his family. More interestingly, is the fact this sighting occurred...about three or four miles west of the the infamous 1965 “Monroe Monster” sighting.",,Monroe County,Michigan,Summer,Report 35868: Retired police officer describes possible nighttime sighting near Monroe.,41.972,-83.3595,9/15/2009,35868,Class B,dpkwz0g2wg,79.38,67.46,55.54,59.92,0.7,0.44,0.89,0,0,,1016.89,Mostly cloudy throughout the day.,4,8.04,355,1.29

"It was summer 2010, my girlfriend and I were saying our goodnights to each other and she left the loft in the garage. It was about midnight; she texted me about 5 minutes after she left about a banging noise. She thought it was me making those noises to scare her. And then a chill ran down my back, because the sound she was hearing was not from me. I told her it was not me and I was a little frightened at first and I did not hear the noise at all for the rest of the night. The next night around the same time, I was walking her home and her and I both heard the same noise. At first we did not mind until we heard it again, and it was closer. We rushed back inside and left the upstairs windows open to listen. We heard the banging noises multiple times, each time getting closer and closer. We kept on hearing leaves crackling like something was walking around and we could tell it was walking on two legs because it was a steady, slow walking pace. We shined the flashlight out the window but due to the trees, we could not see it.

"In Montcalm county Michigan a group of friends, my dog and I were walking down a dirt road that is adjacent from my grandparents cottage near (removed). The time was roughly eleven thirty when we set out for a late night walk, our plans were to walk down to the paved road that intersects the dirt road and back to the cottage. We were on our way back to the cottage and should I say this dirt road we were on runs right through a very dense woodland area that is almost dark in the day time due to the canopy of the trees above road, so at night our line of vision ended as soon as the trees began on the side of the road. Over my friends chatter and occasional laughter  I heard something that sounded rather large following us from behind us to the left, which was the side I was walking on. Whatever that was following us would only move at strategic times when my friends would get a bit too loud or started scraping their feet on the road.  I had the group stop and turn around to face the direction of the noise. One friend got close to me and whispered (removed) look over by that mailbox, and as I turned my head to the left the see what he was talking about I seen a large somewhat illuminated figure slowly walking in a small circle, almost dancing in a way, this really interested me. As soon as the groups attention was focused on the moving figure, I heard a low in volume not threatening grunt. We turned around to see a large pair or red almost orange eyes looking down at us from just within the woods. We stood there and watched it watch us for a few short moments then one friend took off running back to the cabin. As he took off the eyes, still looking directly at me seemed to retreat back into the woods a few yards then got low to the ground continuing to go further and further into the woods. I watched the eyes then disappear, so we walked back to the cottage.

"I was up north visiting my grandparents over summer break. I was walking back to the house after taking a walk to the boat launch. While coming towards the stop sign, I heard a rustling sound to the side of me. I figured it was leaves in the wind so I kept walking. A few seconds later, I heard the noise again, by now it was getting louder. Thinking it was maybe a deer, I slowly walked towards the treeline. I walked into the trees, and crouched down behind the brush was a large, dark brown colored figure about 50 to 60 yards away. I first assumed it was a bear so I started backing up. It never moved while I was there but I got out of the woods as fast as I could. The next night, I heard howls coming from the woods. I've heard wolf and coyote howls before and this was definitely not one. I have heard many strange howls coming from the woods. Some have been far away but others have sounded very close. Every call has either been a loud low pitched howl or a high pitched cry, sounding like a man screaming. Along with the calls were tree knocks. I never thought much of them until hearing the exact sounds on the show Finding Bigfoot. I honestly don't know what I saw but I believe it was a Bigfoot.","Dense forests.

"I think it was in the spring of about 1998-99, my ex-husband woke me up at about three in the morning. We lived in Atlanta at the time, which is about half way between Gaylord and Alpena.

I went with him to the sliding glass door on the back porch and heard the most God-awful sound I have ever heard in my life.

"I am writing this for my neighbor Bill (not his real name). I interviewed Bill on December 25, 2010, and for additional details two times again. Bill said that when he was a teenager he went with a group of 11 relatives and neighbors from Detroit camping in the upper Lower Peninsula of Michigan. They camped west of Twin Lakes in northern Kalkaska County. The group was made up of several men, about 7 boys (ages 7 to 12 years), and Bill. They arrived on a Friday morning and set up camp about 50 ft from the road and in a spot where no one else had camped. They cleared away the underbrush and built two rings of rocks for their campfires. The two rock rings were about 30 ft apart. It was early Spring because Bill recalled there were still patches of snow on the ground under the trees during this trip. In the early evening, they roasted marshmallows and hotdogs –the children sitting around one campfire and the adults around the other.  From behind where Bill was sitting, a rock was thrown into the campsite. About 15 to 20 minutes later, two more rocks were thrown into the camp in quick succession.  The rocks were about the size of cantaloupes. Each rock landed and rolled only a few feet, suggesting the rocks had been lobbed upwards rather than thrown directly into the camp. The rocks had been thrown from beyond their camp clearing. The edge of the clearing was at least 30 ft away from where the rocks landed.  With the first rock thrown, everyone thought someone from their group had thrown the rock as a prank (perhaps while taking a leak in the forest). But when they looked around and saw that everyone was at the campfires, they realized someone else was throwing the rocks. I asked Bill what their reactions were to the rocks landing in their campsite. Bill said that they were surprised and thought it was weird that someone would or could throw such large rocks but no one was alarmed. Bill said that one of the adults had a firearm in his tent, but did not get up to get it. Early the following morning, Bill got up and drove west towards State Highway 66 in order to buy some supplies. He recalls that he was driving with a learner’s permit, so one of the adults rode with him. The road they were on was a narrow hard dirt road without a maintained, clear shoulder. It was like a fire road or logging road.  Bill had driven about 10 miles west of the campsite when he saw a large animal come out of the forest on the north side of the road. It emerged from the forest on all four limbs until it reached the road. On the road’s edge, it stood up and walked across the road in two steps, the first step was in the middle of the road, the second on the other side. Because the forest edge along the south side of the road was dense, the animal immediately vanished from sight as it reentered the forest. When Bill saw the animal, the sun was behind him and still very low, the trees cast long shadows, and he was about 50 yards from where it crossed the road. So he recalls only that it was bigger than a bear, its hair was darker red than a deer, and he was impressed by the strength or force of its stride. When Bill got to the spot where he had seen the figure cross, he stopped briefly but didn’t get out of the truck because the adult he was with told him to drive on. (The adult had been sleeping when the figure crossed the road and awoke when he stopped the truck.)  Because he was driving with a learner’s permit, he was 15 years old. As such, the year was 1962. He thought about what he had seen during the rest of his trip to the store. He thought what he had seen matched descriptions he had heard or read about sasquatch, but thought sasquatch was only seen in the Pacific Northwest. He had not heard of sightings in Michigan. So when he got to the store, he asked the store owner whether he had heard of any local sasquatch sightings.","west of Twin Lakes in Kalkaska County, probably on Twin Lakes Road NE (based on the Google Earth May 12, 1994 image), east of State Highway 66",Kalkaska County,Michigan,Spring,Report 28668: Man recalls encounter he had as a teenager near Kalkaska,44.76665,-85.00165,5/23/2011,28668,Class A,dpgw9tx8tu,70.87,55.965,41.06,57.54,0.82,0.87,0.71,0.0127,1,rain,999.34,Mostly cloudy throughout the day.,6,9.95,232,3.83
"We were mountain biking through ""Lost Nation"", state land that is open to most outdoor activity. The land is hilly and fairly heavily wooded, has a river run through it, and covers a large expanse of land, so there are many remote areas inaccessible to most casual adventurers.  We were riding up the hill leading into the deeper part of the trail, when we stopped to rest, just as we stopped we heard a deep growling kind of sound that was so loud, you could kind of feel it even though the sound came from a good distance away. My friend and I were at a loss to be able to explain the sound...it was as if something was letting us know it was there...but we never saw anything. After a couple of minutes, the loud ""growl"" was heard again...just about as close as the first time. My buddy and I just joked it off as being ""bigfoot"", but I have lived near that area almost all my life, and I heard stories of people seeing something strange out there since I was a small kid...I am now 38 years old. Also, when I was a kid, a group of us came around a corner near my house when we saw what we thought was a bear..we only got a small glimpse of the ""animal"", and I was probably 10 or 11 at the time...so I don't have too vivid a memory about the encounter, but there were 4 or 5 of us in the car, and at least 2 of us were adults and we all agreed that we had seen something. I have ridden the trail several times since the day of the strange sounds, and I always get the feeling of being watched, if I am by myself, I either won't ride that section of trail, or I won't stop at all for the entire 5+ mile section...and I am always looking over my shoulder and all about...the whole area just gives me a weird feeling, and it is so thick in spots that there are several places that something could hide out in...we had even talked about how easy it would be to go in and camp and never see anybody.

"I was camping at the Clark Lake campground in Sylvania Wilderness and went exploring the backroads of the Ottawa Natl Forest on a Saturday morning.  I thought I'd go explore Langford Lake, Pomeroy Lake, and Moosehead Lake. I was driving toward Langford Lake campground, and I took US-2 from Watersmeet and made a left onto CR 527.  About 1/2 way before I got to Langford Lake Rd., I was shocked to see what looked to be ""a monkey with a bear's body"" right in front of the car.  This ""being"" crossed the road right in front of the car.  If I hadn't have slammed on the brakes, I would have hit it!  It was NOT a bear.  I have seen tens of bears in both rural Michigan and rural Virginia over the past 30 years, some while driving and some while hiking, some even face-to-face.  This was not a bear.  All I kept thinking to myself was ""why is there a monkey in the woods? why is there a monkey in the woods?"".  I was stunned and baffled and my mind just couldn't ""figure it out"".  It was like the very first time (while in rural Virginia) I saw a cougar (up close and personal in our yard).  My mind just couldn't comprehend.  After the being crossed the road, I stopped the car and tried to look for it.  There was a small gully on the left that it must have gone down into; but I couldn't see it.  The brush was thick.  I was stunned.  My mind couldn't make sense of it all.  Here was this being, maybe 5 feet in length, dark black-brown, four-footed, running on all fours (not running like a bear runs, I've seen that too), with its underbelly about 2 feet off the ground.  Long and lean, it seemed to me.  Not running very fast, but brisk.  Of all the funny things in the world, it ""seemed"" to be ""smiling"".  It was not threatening at all.  It seemed very innocent.  No pointed head, eyes brown, not a snout.  Not a furry face.  Looked like a monkey's face.  No tail.  It all happened so fast and I wish I had been able to follow it, once it crossed the road.  This was not a bear cub - I have seen at least a half a dozen of them in my life too - climbing trees in the Adirondacks, crossing roads in central VA.  I am still baffled to this day as to what this being was; although something in my gut tells me that I saw a ""baby bigfoot"".","along CR 527, enroute to Langford Lake campground area",Gogebic County,Michigan,Summer,Report 44437: Possible daytime road crossing within the Sylvania Wilderness Area,46.25,-89.5,7/15/2012,44437,Class B,f00r57s1fb,86.31,74.22,62.13,62.97,0.75,0.21,0.89,0,0,,,Foggy in the morning.,8,8.26,323,1.42

"I have three encounters with what I believe to be Bigfoot or an unknown crpytid. 2008- In late fall I accompanied my wife, daughter, and my mother to stay in a rental cabin near island lake, situated near the manistee national forest in northern lower michigan.  As an avid mountain biker I brought along my bike and had planned several rides. The second day of my stay I set off on a ride about 6pm and entered a thick pine/cedar forest on what appeared to be a game trail. After roughly 1.5 miles of riding (I marked a way point on my GPS before entering the woods so I could easily find my way back) I noticed my front tire was very low on air. Shortly after I came to a very small clearing in the woods, it was clear cut purposefully with exposed stumps and new undergrowth. I set my bike against a pine stump and began to repair my front tire. To my right roughly 50-60 yards was a partially destroyed and burnt old RV. Seconds after glancing at it, a very loud thump came from within the camper. All I can describe it is as a ""head"" appeared in a broken window, which had to be over six feet from the base of the camper. From my distance all I could see was jet black fur and no noticeable ears, the eyes were not noticeable or black as well. It cocked its head to the right slightly as I mounted my mountain bike. I rode off quickly following my GPS map back to my starting point. Whatever it was I saw I believe followed me back to my cabin, as very foul and pungent odor lingered outside the next morning. 2009 For a short time while finishing my bachelors degree my wife and daughter lived with my dad. His house was at the end of a very long drive which backed up to hundreds of acres of woods and a large state recreation area called Waterloo in southern lower Michigan. After my parents divorced my mom who is a nurse moved in with her mother to provide care who lived right next door. December 3 I arrived home from school about 7pm. Shortly thereafter (I lived in an apartment in the basement) I hear a knock on the sliding glass door. It was my mother who looked very disturbed and frightened, and says she has been hearing howls all evening. I assumed coyotes as they were very abundant there. She was unshakeable in her opinion that it was not a coyote. I stepped outside onto the patio and shut off the exterior light. What I did notice immediately was a very strong odor being whirled around in the wind. I waited nearly 5 minutes and then I heard it, it was very near the tree line. Howling like I never have heard from a coyote, deep penetrating bass notes that sounded ragged and throaty. It was very windy and beginning to snow, and the howls seemed to occur in different locations. Due to the snow falling overnight no tracks or signs were observed. Thank you for reading my encounters, I appreciate your time.",First encounter was at a rented cabin. The second encounter was at my fathers house which he has since sold.

"Visual incident My wife and I rented a snowmobile for the day after Christmas 12/26/2012 from Roudolph Ranch near Traverse City MI.  Our first exploration on the trip were the trails from the ranch to Traverse City.  We traveled through some forest to a high wire clearing that we felt had too much rugged terrain to continue.  We came to the first road in the high wire clearing and decided to turn around.  I was driving and my wife was riding in the passenger's seat. After turning around I looked across two hills from which we had just come and noticed what appeared on first impression, to be a cross country skier, 200 yards away, coming down the second hill away from us. Immediately many things bothered me about this cross country skier.  First, it was male and it was extremely tall, maybe 8 to 9 feet in height.  (It was very male because of its wide shoulder to slim waste shape)  Second, he appeared to traverse the steep down hill slope like a down hill skier attacking the slope in parallel skier motions but in very long foot steps instead of sliding skies in downhill parallel motion. No skies were noticed.  Third, and most puzzling, was that the figure was dark, dirty rusty, red from top of head to bottom of foot except for the face which was jet black. Finally the figure appeared very unnatural in movement. The entire sighting lasted a total of maybe 5 seconds. As I drove back over the area where I saw the figure I looked intently for cross country ski tracks.  I found none.  We also did not come across a skier and the area at the bottom of the hill dumped into a very thick wooded area blocked by a barbed wire fence. At the time I thought about stopping and looking for foot prints but was afraid of asking my wife if she saw what I thought I had just seen so I moved on. Whatever I saw bothered me all day.  Later in the evening I asked my wife if she noticed the cross country skier which I had seen. She had not seen the skier.  When I walked her through the event and told her that I think I saw a Bigfoot she just laughed and continues to laugh at me today. The sighting has continued to bother me over a month later.  I'm convinced that what I saw was too tall, was not clothed naturally, and moved too unnaturally to be a human.",I've described the location as best I can.

"It was early april here in southern michigan, I was sitting watching tv around 2:30 AM and was preparing to go to bed when I felt like I was being watched. I live in a rented 12x70 2 bedroom trailer.   I was sitting at my pc looking across the room at the tv, when I felt odd and noticed in my peripheral vision that I couldn't see my neihgbor's outside light. That is when I turned to look straight out the window, the window was about 4 feet from me, and I found myself staring straight into the big , yellowed, bloodshot eyes of a sasquatch.  It looked like it was hairy all over -  I saw a hint of reddish, light brown colored hair on the forearm and shoulder.  The lighting on it was poor and I couldn't make out any facial features besides the eyes and it was staring right back at me. I have been living in this trailer for 6 months over winter months with no signs of anything strange going on around here. Well I jumped from my chair and threw off the blanket I had on my legs and stared right at it for a second and then realised my front door wasn't completely shut and locked.  I hurriedly reached for the handle to shut it and lock it and when the door handle met my hand, I tried to push it closed but it wouldn't move.  It was actually pushing the door open on me! After trying to move it, it wouldn't budge, so I gave in and sprinted to the back of my trailer and shut the bathroom door behind me and listened. I didn't hear anything actually enter the house, and after a few minutes of quiet, I exited the bathroom and entered my bedroom and got my gun and woke my wife. We both walked quietly back into the living room and the door was opened half-way, but there was no sign of it. I called a friend on the phone to come over to use his truck lights and my flashlights to search around but there was no more signs of it that night. The next morning I looked for tracks but there were none.  I did however find something like hairy, muddy fingerprints on the window pane.  I snapped a couple shots of it, and I stood where it was and determined the height to be around 8-81/2 feet tall. Since that night, both my wife and I have heard loud, mournful vocalizations in the middle of the night.  We have both gone out to investigate when we hear them and we hear loud, very large sounding ""things"" moving through the brush and weeds, shaking weeds, and we have smelled an awful, dead-skunk like smell on a couple of occassions in the early mornings. My friend and I have sat in a vehicle for a few hours in the early night, 11 PM-2 AM, and have heard brush and movement thru weeds attracting dogs close by to bark, and have had rocks or sticks thrown at the vehicle we are in. Also we were using a million candle spot that night we had stones thrown, and my friend swears he saw something ""manlike"" walking across our field of vision but we didn't get cameras or spot on it fast enough.That night I mention, which was 7-12-2006, was a full moon night so we had good night vision for a ways. My friend has also had large footprints in his driveway and has a local friend of his son has seen a pair of eyes, really high up and not very far away in the weeds while he and my friend's son and another boy were out jumping on a trampoline in the early evening one night 2 yrs ago and now he won't go out at night, and he is 16yrs old. My neighbors have been calling the police a couple of times a year, always in spring or summer, about ""someone"" or ""something"" walking and sneaking around their yard at night. This has been happening for about 8 yrs total now.  This property was all wood and scrub, and thick brush till around 8 yrs ago when the landowner cleared it up. The landlord's nephew said he saw a ""man"" walking through the yard around 11:30 AM 4 weeks ago and he thought it might have been me, but it wasn't.  We went to the area he saw it in during daylight and I was much shorter then what he saw. The landlord's wife was walking around a trailer in the middle of the property during the afternoon and felt like she was being watched and then she heard something very large run away through the brush just around the corner of a trailer where she was walking. This property is about 20 acres; he cleared about 10 of it and has 3 rental trailers on it.  I occupy one at the south end of the property, and he lives in one at the north end of the property.  The one in the middle is vacant, plus a couple of tool, supply  trailers(12x70 each) which he keeps shut and locked but the doors keep coming open and  there is some damage that we can't explain that looks like some of the siding was pried up or something tried to rip a piece off.  Also there are deep scratches around this piece of siding. The landlord and I have heard something tossing around some wood studs he has stacked up in the middle of his property and also we have heard what sounded like a long pipe thrown into weeds banging on a piece of wood. Since the first night I saw this big guy, I have heard it give out vocalizations like I have never heard before.  I have been an outdoorsman my whole life and I swear these were sounds like no other animal in this region would make.  Both my wife and I have heard what sounds like a pair of ""bigfeet"" walking thru woods by my house, dragging something and grunting back and forth at each other.  This occured around 5:45 AM. We hear it/them at least once a week, but around full moon times it seems to do more yelling and moving through brush when I go out to investigate.   I have tried vocalizing back from my front yard and both my wife and I heard something yell back across the field when I did it.  When my friend and I staked em out, just before we called it a day, I tried to yell a vocalization and that is when a few minutes afterwards I heard something in the brush and a rock hit the back of my van we were sitting in.  This was around 2:30 AM.

"Had a very unusual experience while deer hunting. I had shot a deer and spine shot it, it was doing a death scream until I dispatched it. I then field dressed it and was on my way out when I began hearing a terrible scream unlike anything i have ever heard before. It was heading right into the area I had just shot and field dressed the deer It continued the screaming for about five minutes getting closer and closer, I was about probably 200 yards from where I had field dressed the deer and could tell it was right there where I had just got the deer, needless to say I got out of there as fast as I possibly could, now I can't say that I have ever seen any sign of anything unusual there although I have never looked. I have heard trees fall on occasion while in my stand and it was calm out, never really gave thought to why they fell. Also on several occasions I have been followed out of the woods, I would walk, it would follow, I would stop it would stop. Now we do have bobcats in the area and I have heard they will do this and have heard them. I know whatever it was I heard that night was no bobcat.

"A few of my brothers friends, my brother & I were sitting at home. My brother & his friends were in the next room & I was in the dining room on the computer when I heard loud banging & thumping on the deck.

But I kept hearing the noise, so I went & got my brother & his friends & we all went outside to check out the noise, there was nothing there.

It scared my cat which was out near it. So we went back inside got a flashlight & several small blunt weapons incase we were attacked. Three of us ventured out to the driveway & the last one stayed at the house. Us other three went to the driveway & saw nothing. We all heard the same low growling & groaning.

"This occurred in western Michigan November of 1978, when I was about 13 years old. I lived in Cedar Springs, Mi on Myers Lake Road near 17 mile rd. The land today is a golf course. At the time, this was all rural farm land and woods. I hunted all around western Michigan when I lived up there. One evening while whitetail deer hunting, I was sitting in a cut corn field with about 5 or 6 inches of snow on the ground. It was just turning dusk. I had been sitting in this field for about an hour and a half. I was sitting on the ground leaning against a fence post looking over the field. There was a low wooded area behind me. All of a sudden, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up and I felt very uneasy as if something was watching me. I did not see anything although I was trying to be still while hunting. This feeling was not going away and I moved to look behind me and at the edge of the trees there was a Sasquatch standing there looking at me. It was dark brown, about 7 ft. tall, with hair about 6 or 7 inches long and the face was a little lighter than the rest of the animal. I turned back around quickly and thought to myself that what I saw couldn't be. I had not known anything about big foot at the time. I had a .35 Marlin rifle with a Tasco 3x9 scope on it. I turned back around to get a better look and it was still standing there just staring at me. I looked through the scope (he was standing about 150-200 yards away from where I was) and it definitely was a Sasquatch standing there. We looked at each other for about 2 or 3 minutes and I got increasingly scared of it, although it never made any indication of hostility. I got up and ran out of the field and across the road to my house. I did not tell anyone about the sighting until I was about 23 years old and was hunting with one of my best friends. There were reports of a 'Skunk Ape' on our hunting land in Southern Georgia on the edge of the Okefenokee Swamp. We often heard it screaming at night and supposedly the DNR cast foot print molds of it in the area. I then told my friend of my sighting as a child because I didn't think I would be ridiculed.I moved to North Florida in 1979 and have resided here since then.

"Hi, This is really wierd for me, and I have no idea if BigFoot even exists and have never in my life considered that it may. I do not mean to waste your time and do not intend to. I just want to let you know what I have experienced and it could be nothing at all. I have NEVER in my life read about signs of a bigfoot or anything of the kind so I don't know what to look for, but it occurred to me that something odd is going on in the woods behind my house in Northern Michigan (my summer home). Upon arrival to Michigan for the summer, I walked around the back of my house via my wraparound porch and smelled such a pungent aroma kind of like a sulfer/waste smell mixed with the strongest male body odor I have ever encountered. It was about 50 degrees outside and I could not get over the strong smell which literally overwhelmed me. The home has been vacant for months and noone would have been near the house in the preceding days of our arrival. It smelled like a man, but more like a poopy body odor but literally ten times stronger. My house is located on a cul de sac with only 2 other homes on it both at least 100 yards and 200 yards away. Our lot is big about 1-1/2-2 acres with woods on 3/4 and the 3rd hole of the golf course on the other 1/4. The woods however are quite thick and have lots of deer and turkey etc. The next day I went outside again early in the morning and smelled it again so strongly. The smell actually lasted around 2 1/2 days and then finally went away. Keep in mind that the house has been vacant for over 9 months until we arrived. Then 2 nights ago my husband and I heard a deep-throated moan or sream kind of like an animal dying but it didn't sound like an animal and it didn't sound human either.

At first we just looked at each other and kept walking.  Then we heard it again and it was a little louder.  We hesitated and I asked her if she heard that.  She said yes.  We looked in the direction of the noise and sure enough.  There was a stick banging back and forth between two trees that were in a growth of trees.  It was a large stick and you could see the end of it very well so it had to be sticking straight out.  I'd guess it was about six and a half feet up the tree you could see it.

"I am from northern lower Michigan and two years ago was driving on I-75 just north of Wolverine, Michigan.  It was in the middle of summer and I was driving alone to see my family on Mullet Lake.

So I stopped behind a few cars but it was visible as to what everyone was stopped for.  Ahead to my right a massive figure was stepping out of the woods and at first I thought it was a huge bear but it was walking on its hind legs.  It was covered in dark hair and was taller then any bear i have ever seen.  So then I thought it was a gorilla, because its hands were curled under as if it had been walking on them previously.  The creature crossed the highway and then proceeded into the woods on the left of me.  I thought i was dreaming, so i looked over to the car on my right and their faces were just as shocked as mine were.

"Myself  and several others were at our deer hunting campsite, we had used the same spot for years. While we were sitting  at our campfire, we heard this mournful wail just outside the light of the campfire behind one of the campers. Next there was what sounded like a low growl then a sort of howl yelping sound, we all went for flashlights and stopped dead in our tracks when we heard the sounds of trees being snapped and branches breaking. We changed from flashlights to rifles as the growling increased. We stood there looking out into the dark for what seemed like 20 min or so then the sound started moving away deeper into the woods. At daybreak we ventured out towards where the sounds were coming from and found several small trees snapped and bushes uprooted. There were what could have been footprints but the ground was so tore up, it was impossible to tell what kind they were. Later that morning a friend of mine was out scouting for a place to put his blind and he came across a huge mound of earth that looked as though it was just piled there. He called the camp on his walkie talkie and told us to come out to where he was we could find him by following his trail markers into the woods going south off the logging road. When we got to him he was pointing his rifle towards some thickets of tag alder saying that when he approached the huge pile of sand and earth he heard the same sounds that we had heard the night before coming from that direction.To make a long story short we contacted the DNR in Harrisvile and an officer came out upon examining the dirt mound several mutilated deer and some wild blackberry bushes were buried in it. Again the ground was tore up so bad that no distinguishing footprints were apparent. The DNR officer said that what we had in the area was most likely a big bear. We have used that site ever since and have never encountered anything like that year again. We still talk about it over the campfire though.","Huron National Forest in the Hayes Tower area, Beaver Pond 1/4 mile away.",Alcona County,Michigan,Fall,"Report 7272: Hunters endure hour-long, intimidation behavior by unseen aggressor(s)",44.6375,-83.51418,11/7/2003,7272,Class B,dputgw4b69,32.41,25.6,18.79,15.1,0.59,0.44,0.46,0,0,,1023.16,Mostly cloudy throughout the day and breezy until afternoon.,2,9.94,267,10.22

Everything was fine until we went to bed at around 3:45 in the morning.  4 girls slept in one tent while my best friend and I slept in another tent.  About 15 minutes after we finally got settled in we heard some loud screaming/grunting.  I knew that I had never heard anything like that before.  My friend and I were totally silent and listened again.  We heard it again but it was moving fast thru the forest.  We agreed that after that we would not be able to sleep by ourselves.  We left our tent, grabbed the hatchets from our campsite and slept in the tent with the other girls.  I did not sleep at all that night until after sunrise.  I was scared out of my mind!  I stayed awake with the hatchet in my hand for the rest of the night and the following night.  Later on that same evening/morning I heard something walk thru our campsite but I didn't even move.  I was too scared.  In the morning I thought I heard our cooler open but I was much too tired and thought it was one of the girls.

"On Sunday, May 19, 2002, my family and I were camping on our land, riding a dirt bike and hiking. While we were taking turns riding our motorcycle, my eleven year old son spotted what looked like a ""cave man"" sitting near our camp site, about 75 yeards away. The view of it was slightly obstructed by some large straw bales, therefore I didn't see it at first when my son tried to point it out to me. By the time I finally saw it, it had stood up and was walking away towards heavy tree growth and a steep ravine. What I saw was a very large, man-like, reddish brown colored, hairy creature with its back towards me. All I could see was it's upper half, stooped forward slightly, with what appeared to be a very long, muscular right arm. The Head appeared larger than human from my angle. My son saw the right side of it's face, saying it looked like a cave-man like in the books. The face had light brown skin, with no hair on it's face, but slightly deformed-looking. That's about all he can recall. I think it took him totally by surprise. It appeared to be about seven feet tall. After calming down from this we decided to walk in the direction it headed for and found three or four very large foot prints in the creek bed area. They were slightly larger than my size thirteen boots, with five distinct human-type toes. Later that afternoon while I was riding the dirt bike, it suddenly stopped on me, about a half mile from the sighting. Looking at the wiring on the motorcycle, and alone there in the gully, I heard a very high pitched scream coming from what seemed a quarter to half mile away from me, opposite the direction of our camp. i thought it might be my family, but after getting the bike up and running right away, I quickly discovered it couldn't have been them. They were near our camp to the rear of me. No one else was on the land but us. That evening, our closest neighbor's ( 1 1/2 miles away) dog started barking like crazy around 11:00 pm and was heading our way down thru the woods. I could hear the dog barking all night long, while  what seemed he was following or chasing something all over the place. Around 3:30 am, I could hear the dog was about one hundred yards away from us, just going nuts and acting very vicious. All of a sudden, while laying there in our tent, I heard something huge come crashing thru the trees and run right by my head, with what sounded like bi-pedal type footsteps, only extremely fast and heavy (the ground near my head shook somewhat when it went by), with the dog right behind it. I sat up and counted the heads in my tent to be sure we were all accounted for. Then the dog let out a terrible yelp and everything got very quiet.

We drove our snowmobiles through 2 portage trails and onto the second lake where I spotted the first set of tracks. The strides in the tracks and depth of the snow convinced us that they were not made by man, but were similar to man's walk. We took pictures and proceeded to the first lake that we portaged too. Here I had found similar tracks on the 1st lake as I did on the second lake. I did not take any pics of these prints at this time. march 10 2007 We had another couple come up to snowmobile with.

"I tell this very hesitantly because I'm certain this will probably be ignored and maybe laughed at or eyes rolled back by you in disbelief. But, here goes, just the same; Around the first week in October of this year, I had decided to go out squirrel hunting since it was such a nice day. I went out to a piece of land we had previously owned and have retained hunting rights on it. I had just left my truck and headed down into the woods, checking out a large rock/over-hang formation when something moving to my right (southwest) about 175-200 feet away, caught my eye. I was looking thru rather thick brush, separated by a barbed wire fence, a  creek bed and lots of vegetation and thick brush. At first, all I could see was what looked like ""the biggest turkey I'd ever seen' flapping its wings in a very strange way. All I could make out was something that appeared to be a very large black turkey flapping its wings in a very strange, but fast manner. I moved around to the right a little bit to try and get a better look, when all of a sudden this thing gets up on two feet and starts running like a bat out of hell. It no more got up when suddenly another one, much larger and reddish brown in color jumped up behind it and in its attempt to catch up to the black one, appeared to almost fall forward, all the while moving very, very fast and disappearing just as quickly, but amazingly quietly thru some of the thickest brush we have down there. I think I was frozen stiff in disbelief, trying to gather what I had just seen. I stood there, dazed for about a minute and decided to cross the barbed wire fence and creek bed and go over to where I had seen ""them"" get up and run. Once I got over there, I found indentations in the soft grassy, almost marsh-like terrain, but no real discernable tracks. what is interesting is that what I thought I had seen as a turkey flapping it's wings,was probably the black animal sitting or kneeling, and reaching up for choke-cherries on the tree it was nearby. I followed their brief trail right up to where they silently entered the thick brush and decided not to go any further, thinking that if two creatures so huge could go thru that thick brush so quitely, how would I ever know they hadn't circled back and were watching me from behind? I got spooked at that thought and got out of there.

Straight in front of us about 60 yards was an iron ore hill, the top of it was clearly visible with a straight flat top as most of them are.

I started to make fun of the way this person was walking. The Arms were long and swaded back and forth with each stride. The legs were also long and odd looking as it walked.

It was not round in the body as a bear, but more lanky.  Its hard to judge the height, but it was at least as tall as a tall man.  It did not move or look like a bear.

This happened last year during bow season in michigan. I had walked a large loup on my friends property and came up to the swamp part of the small lake. I sat down then heard the most eerie scream i have ever heard and i am positive it was not a deer or bobcat. It was almost human like but i could feel the anger in the scream. i was probally 50 yards from the lake with heavy vegitation and trees between the lake and me and the scream came from inside the 50 yards. After the scream i stood up and heard what sounded like huge rocks being thrown into the lake. I got out of that area as quick as i could.,55 to f30 then turn on bamfield,Alcona County,Michigan,Fall,Report 21969: Possible vocalization heard at dusk by bowhunter near Glennie,44.56215,-83.78585,10/1/2006,21969,Class B,dpumt2m124,60.23,48.805,37.38,44.4,0.85,0.56,0.3,0,0,,,Mostly cloudy in the morning.,3,9.28,286,4.11
"On Saturday, October 21, 2006 my brother-in-law and I were bowhunting for deer in Alcona County in an area that we had been hunting for several years when we heard a sound that neither of us can explain. I was sitting in my tree stand facing basically south with my back to a dense cedar area with a small creek and a mixed hardwood forest in front of me.  My brother-in-law was hunting in a similar situation approximately 200 yards to my east.  The time was around 5:45 in the evening and the weather was clear and relatively warm perhaps in the upper 50s – low 60s.  At this time I had a small 4-point deer come walking down a deer run from the east toward me and stop approximately 40 yards away, standing there sniffing the air around it.  The light breeze was out of the north/northeast with the deer definitely upwind of me.  The deer stood there for about a minute or two mostly looking to the north and east, then turned directly south and walked away.  Shortly after this moment I heard a screaming sound coming from the east.  The sound had a human quality to it and sounded more angry than distressed.  I immediately thought my brother-in-law was hollering for some reason as he was in that direction but chose not to contact him via radio.  There were several short 10 second screams lasting a little over a minute and then stopped.  I sat there completely perplexed having never heard a sound like that before.  After this I noticed the conspicuous absence of any sound or movement in the forest.  Prior to this the woods had been filled with the sound of twittering birds and chattering squirrels.  After this, the forest was dead quiet.  This was the most eerie part of the whole event.  After the sun went down and I met my brother-in-law on our way back to camp he asked me what I had been doing to make that strange sound.  To him, the sound came from the west where I was sitting.  For me the sound was coming from the east where he was sitting so whatever the sound was it originated between us.  At this point neither of us had any idea of what could have made that sound.  We continued to hunt for the rest of the weekend without any more incidents or anything else unusual occurring. I had forgotten all about this when one day the following April I was watching an old episode of the television series “In Search Of” that was about the search for Bigfoot.  During this episode they talked about a particular bigfoot researcher.   For fun I went on the internet to see if this researcher was still around as this episode was 20 years old at least.  This is when I found the BFRO website and looked for sightings in Michigan.  When I found the report of the hunters being harassed in the fall of 1985 in the same area we had been in it all came rushing back to me.  Since then I found and downloaded a sound file from another website of a vocalization recording in Klamath, California.  I sent this to my brother–in-law and he agreed that this was very similar to what we had heard although what we had heard was deeper in pitch. I have thought about submitting this report a number of times since then but for whatever reason haven’t.  Now that deer season is quickly approaching I have been thinking about the incident more.  I still don’t know what it was that we heard but it certainly wasn’t anything I have ever heard before or after.  It was eerie at first returning to the location with this new found thought in my head but in the years since I have not had any additional experiences although I would like to get another chance to prove to myself that it wasn’t all a dream.",Approximately 1 mile west of Stout Road and 1/2 mile south of M-72,Alcona County,Michigan,Fall,Report 26617: Two bowhunters hear possible screams near Glennie,44.62,-83.62335,5/19/2011,26617,Class B,dputc4g66d,60.84,54.235,47.63,54.47,0.97,1,0.58,0.0124,1,rain,,Rain in the morning.,4,6.79,21,4.11
"My wife and I were night fishing off the docks of chaonia landing at lake wappapello in late fall early winter 2007. At around midnight we heard rocks being thrown into the lake from across the bank.  we went to the end of the dock to see what was going on. coming down the bank along the waters edge rocks were being thrown into the water about every 50 feet or so, big rock the size of bowling balls. the bank I'm speaking of is actually an island with water on three sides of it for about 5-6 miles, and it ends right in front of the boat docks we were fishing. coming straight towards us along the bank something was throwing these boulders into the water, when out of the trees came a rock straight at us and landed in the water 6 feet in front of us followed by a very deep growl and grunt.  the distance from the end of the dock and the opposite bank is maybe 50 feet. we stood there looking into the trees desperately trying to see whatever was growling at us yet it stayed just inside the tree line.  the lights from the docks light up the whole opposite bank from point to point.  up and down the bank this creature went tossing rocks and growling and screaming.  then we noticed another creature on our side of the bank coming down towards us throwing rocks into the water howling after each rock hit the water.  the two were doing this in unison up and down the bank for over an hour while we were trapped on the dock in fear.  the one caught on the island worked his way into a huge angry fit. the two seemed to be letting the other one know where the other was.  there is so much we witnessed, heard saw that i cant possibly write all down here. for nearly two hours we stood terrified as we realized what we were experiencing. we have not really told our story to any other than family. its too unbelievable.",if you look at the location of chaonia landing you'll note it sits in the middle of three points of land surrounded by the waters of lake wappapello. these two creatures were across the water from each other trying to find a path back together. eventually they went off in the direction they came continueing to call to each other.,Wayne County,Missouri,Winter,Report 27261: Couple witness rocks thrown and possible vocalizations between two animals on either side of a fishing dock near Williamsville,36.57869,-90.21339,11/18/2007,27261,Class B,9yxb54uw7d,64.62,61.91,59.2,48.79,0.86,0.49,0.28,0,0,,1019.79,Overcast starting in the afternoon.,3,7.56,112,1.51

"I live outside Farmington MO and I have a deer lick just out side the wood line in my back yard and there is always deer. I was just getting home from work one night after I closed, it was about 11 and I like to see the deer just to see what we have around my house. And in the upper left hand corner of my yard about 25 yards away from my deer lick I saw a big figure about 7' maybe 8' tall. I was thinking it was a poacher in the yard killing deer. So I turned my brights on and started walking toward the figure. As I was walking I started to smell kinda like a smell of body odor and mildew smell and I was scared when I realized it wasn't a hunter. It took off down a game trail in the brush. I also need to say I'm not hunting off the lick, and the deer run when I pull up. I wasn't walking over there with a group of deer. But to continue, the next day I walked back into the woods and looked.

"While Bow-hunting in Creve Coeur bottoms, I had been in my stand all day and had no luck. So I got down right before dusk and proceded to stalk along side a trail leading to the river. I had come to a point were the trail turns and runs parelell to the river.When I started around the turn something moved in the corner of my eye off to my right. My first thought was that I was going to scare up a deer, So I drew my Bow and tried to take aim on the area of movement, But what I saw was not a deer. At first, I thought it was a man in camo laying on the ground, That freaked me out, so I let off my Bow. However, I was trying to make out this ""person"" laying on the ground, on thier belly, When it raised up on it's right arm, turned the upper half of it's body, And looked at me. This was no person. It was to dark to see any features, But I could see two legs stretched out behind it, Two arms in front, A large torso, And a head. It seemed to be covered in greyish-brown from head to toe. No visible gear, Which struck me as odd, So I continued to try and figure out what this was. I stared at it, And it at me, When I felt the need to LEAVE. I did not feel threatened, Just that I had to go. As I began to leave and head back toward the levee, I kept thinking about turning back because I could not believe what had happened, But something made me go out of the woods. I have grown up in woods all my life, Have hunted in south-central and eastern  Missouri, And grew up only a few miles from here, But never before have I seen Something I could not explain. If this thing had stood up, It would easy have been a foot or more taller than Me.","This area was behind Chesterfield Golf  Club, and bordered up river by St. Louis County Water Works.

"It was July, 1978.  My family had just moved from Illinois to Cape Fair, Missouri a few weeks before. Our parents went back to Illinois for a funeral and my sisters (ages 16 & 14) and I (12 years old at the time) were there alone.  It was late at night around 11 or midnight when we all were startled by our dogs barking and growling on the porch.  Normally the dogs would go down to the driveway if they heard something.  This time they stayed on the porch looking towards the front yard barking and growling like I have never heard them do before.  What scared us was that the dogs were scared to go down off the porch. We turned all the lights off in the house and looked out the front windows and door to see if we could see headlights or something outside.  There was a flood light at the corner of the driveway that cast a light on the front yard.  The front yard was all uphill with a 5 ft barbed wire fence separating our yard from the pasture.  The front yard had huge black walnut trees spaced about 30-50 feet apart scattered around.  I was looking out the front window and saw a large figure standing partially behind a walnut tree.  I stared at it a few moments to focus in the dim light to see what it was.  I thought it was maybe a drunk camper who was lost.  You could walk down our back yard to the lake, so I thought maybe someone was looking for a way to the lake through our yard.  People would camp and fish very close by, so we thought somebody was lost.  All around our house it was dense forest and there was only one other house on our 1/2 mile road, so we were very isolated. My 16 yers old sister went to calm the dogs down.  The 14 year old and I were stioll looking out front.  Then after a few moments the figure dashed to the next tree about 50 feet away in about 3 or 4 strides.  I kept looking and before I could ask my 14 yr old sister if she saw that- she ran to the back porch to help my 16 yr old sister with the dogs.  By this time the dogs were freaking out.  Then I looked back to the front yard where I saw it go to another tree, then another tree-zigzagging its way up the hill towards the pasture.  Then to my amazement it cleared the barbed wire fence in one stride and was gone into the night.  My sisters were tending to the dogs so they didn't see all of what I saw.  My 14 year old sister said she saw something by the tree-but she never said anything more than that.  I don't know if they were trying to keep me from getting scared, but I think she saw it too.  I told my parents about it when they got home.  They just blew it off to a city kid seeing ""something"" in the country night.  While I lived there until 1984, I had heard stories of the ""Ozark Mountain Monster"" but thought it was just folklore. I did have several conversations with oldtimers from the area and heard stories of bigfoot sightings over the years, but never had the courage to ""go public"".

"Hi, My brother and I were camping @ Jerktail Landing on the shores of the Current River in MO. It's about 2300hrs and we don't have the fire on yet.  We wanted to see what creatures would get close. This a fairly remote primitive campsite. About 30 feet from us in the woods, we heard the growl and scream of something big. Our instincts told both of us that it could be a Bigfoot. The fire came on really quick after that. We had such an adrenaline rush that we started to giggle like little girls. We never even spoke of bigfoot before and we were not expecting or hoping for something like that. We were there for 4 nights and that happened the first night.

"My parents had just settled on a new house for our family the day before Christmas.  We were so excited that we couldn't wait, so we moved in on Christmas Day.  There were only two bedrooms in the back of the house, which were claimed by my parents and younger brother.  I was happy enough with a ""study"" in the front of the house, which had very large windows on two sides, practically covering the entire wall area.  Because of the unusual size and shape of the windows, we didn't have anything immediately to cover them, but we weren't concerned because we were in a secluded area off the road and woods all around.  Also, the front side of the house where my room was located, was on a slope, so no one could walk right up and actually see into my room without a ladder.  When I woke up that first morning in my new room, I was excited to see the beautiful layer of snow all around the wooded yard.  I was startled, though, to see a set of footprints coming from the back of the house, from the woods.  The footprints came up along the side of the house and then circled around to my front window.  I told my parents immediately, and my dad went out to investigate.  The footprints were huge, like twice the size of my dad's foot in width and almost twice as big in length.  My dad dismissed it as someone walking through the woods with boots on and not worried because the windows were too high for someone to see into.  The shape was not right for a boot, though. I would have dismissed that completey except that the early summer of 1981 , another incident occurred which my mom, brother and I have never been able to forget or quite reconcile.  We were standing outside at dusk.  My uncle had just dropped by to check on us because my dad had been away on a trip.  He had just driven out of our driveway and we turned to walk back inside.  There was an eery feeling and we all noticed how there was silence.  No crickets chirping or frogs croaking, or other usual evening animal sounds.  Then a monstrous roar came from the darkness of the woods behind us.  No one said a word, we just all three took off running for the front door.  I still get goosebumps when I think about that sound.  I've never heard anything like it in real life ever before or since.  It sent a chill of fear right to my core.  It was deep, and long and powerful.  My uncle did return an hour later and looked around the house with a flashlight.  He didn't see or hear anything.  We dismissed it as a panther scream but never really were convinced that it was that.","V Hwy. exit off Interstate I-44, about a mile or mile and a half west.

"I was just a kid when I saw it.  I was sitting in the back of an old Chevy Citation at the time it was pretty new, my uncle was driving and my aunt was in the passenger seat and my little cousin who was around 4 or 5 at the time was sitting in the back with me, were coming home and I believe from visiting family or something.  My aunt & uncle lived down this old dirt road around 2 miles and right before their driveway which was on the left was and old dry branch or creek that ran across the road and it did not have a concrete slab to cross over it so you had to slow down a little to cross.  Directly to the right of the creek was an old driveway leading to an old abandoned house which no one had lived in for years.  It was dark so naturally we had the headlights on and as my uncle began slowing to pass over the rough gravel something in the corner of my right eye came into view.  My aunt kind of screamed but not loudly because we were amazed and terrified.  Something that looked to be around 8 foot tall, (I know as a 10-11 year old kid it was huge) came across the branch which led out of the old driveway and not running but walking briskly came directly in front the car.  We all just stared as it was some dream.  It was swinging it's arms a little and acted like we were not even there.  It walked across the creek and crossed the water gate which I don't remeber if it went under or over but what I do remeber is the branch had washed out the bank of my uncle's yard and his perimter fence was quite tall if you were staning in the branch and this bright red haired thing jumped over from the bed of the branch like nothing and into my uncles yard.  Mind you were still watching in the car.  We could see it walk up thru the yard and up the hill until we lost sight of it with the headlights.  My uncle turned into the drive and we had all locked the doors.  My aunt and uncle went thru the count of 3 thing and we open the doors and ran inside.  We got inside and my uncle got his hunting rifle out and went outside with his flood lite and looked for it and on his way back which he didn't walk far he tripped on the chord and it came unplugged then he yelled and got up and ran into the house and locked the door.  To this day if you ask him about what he saw he will say he saw something but he doesn't know what it was or that somebody was playing a joke on us.  My aunt will tell that she saw bigfoot and so will I.  My little cousin was to small to remeber much but I remeber and to this day I don't go out into the woods without a weapon.  To the best of my ability this is what it looked like.  It was around 7-8 foot tall, completly covered in red hair and 1 feature I remember is it looked like it's arms were almost as long as it's legs and that it was not afraid of us.  Also at that time there was a man I do not remember but lived in the area and was at the local store there in Souder, Mo. and was telling everyone he had seen bigfoot and no one believed him so none of us ever made much mention to it except to family or close friends.  But I believe. I know what I saw.","From 60 highway East from Springfield, Mo. take 5 Highway South to 95 Hwy. North and it is approx. 6 miles  then left county road.

"It was a student at Missouri Southern State College at the time.  And a popular hangout was at Wildcat Park. One evening several students were out there and a friend of mine asked me to drive him out there.  Around midnite we were heading back to campus, I was taking a curve and as I got into the corner I saw a large ape-like, human-like creature standing just off the pavement. I would say it was 7.5'-8' tall and 350-400 pounds.  I'm not sure of the color since it was dark. I would say it was dark brown, but the moonlight and limited visibility gave it's coat a whiteish sheen. The vehicle I was driving was a 'lifted' pickup truck.  I was able to see eye-to-eye with it. The creature appeared to be much taller than the vehicle, but it was either squatting slightly or hunched down a bit. It had very broad shoulders, much larger than anything I had ever seen. They were close to 3' across. I looked right into it's face and it's eyes were a deep black. They could have been brown, and appeared darker due to the lack of light.","This was out in an area close to Shoal Creek in Joplin, MO.",Newton County,Missouri,Fall,Report 27785: Nighttime roadside sighting by a motorist outside Joplin,37.03575,-94.52888,6/22/2010,27785,Class A,9ysf8ynhvk,95.1,85.505,75.91,72.99,0.68,0.08,0.38,0,0,,1015.26,Humid throughout the day.,11,9.96,183,6.6
"I was living at in Missouri at the time, about a mile from where my sighting took place. I was on my way home from a friends house on my bike about to head up the hill. I heard something off in the woods to my left and looked to see what it was. I was very used to being in the woods, having grown up around them all my life. I expected to see a deer or some other type of wildlife that I was so familiar with. But, I turned and saw what I still believe was bigfoot. It was a little less than a hundred yards away, and walking perpendicular to me. The strides that it took were amazing, so fluid. There was no real bobbing of the head like I have heard of from other sightings, and the arms didn't swing out as much as others have reported, it was very human like. It's body was covered in a brown hair, not a very dark brown though. It was more the color sandstone, that's the best thing I can think of to compare the color. I watched it walk for about a minute, I was to scared to move at all, so I was just kind of frozen there watching it. Then it stopped right beside a large birch tree. I was afraid that it had seen me and didn't know what it would do, so I turned to look up the hill and contemplate running up the hill towards my house or to turn and run back to my friends house. I decided that I was going to leave my bike and run back to my friends since it wasn't up hill to his house. I turned to look back and see where the creature was at and couldn't see it anymore. I believe it hid behind the large birch that it stopped beside. That's when I ran, I was so scared I just ran to my friends house and didn't even knock, I just ran inside and told them what had happened. I made his dad drive me home, we picked up my bike on the way. I never went down that road again on my bike, I never had the nerve to.","I can't remember the exact road name that I spotted it from.

"When I was living in Brixey, Missouri I lived out in the country. We had woods all around us and the houses were all spaced out. We had a good size pond in our yard and a lot of deer and other animals came through to drink from the pond. One night me and my now ex-husband were asleep. It was the middle of the night when I was woken up by the sound of my rabbit that was in a big dog kennel on the porch that was covered, to keep the rabbit from the cold. The kennel was right outside the front door and under a window.  Where my bed was I had a clear view of the front door and the window. When I woke there was a big dark figure in the window. It looked big and hairy. I don't know what it was but I do know it was not a dog, coyote, a deer or a bear. My two dogs that I had there, that I still have, will bark at everything, but didn't bark.

"Highway 7 South, Richland, MO 2158 September 4, 2012 My daughter who had come to visit me was getting ready to leave.  We were taking a last minute look at my garden which is very close to the house.  We had only been out there a couple of minutes and then we heard the most unusual screaming sound.  My daughter asks if it was a coyote and I said NO and ushered her back to the house.  The call came less than 150 feet from the house.  It was loud and remarkable.  The dog that usually barks and runs after everything ran under the house. I did not say what I thought it was to her; instead we looked on the internet for sounds that might occur, like coyotes, panthers, fox, Barn owls, etc. After going through the whole directory.  She asks what the sound was.  We then listened to recorded sounds from Big Foot recordings.  Our stomachs turned. Yes, that is exactly what it sounded like.  I have lived in the country most of my life.  I grew up listening to coyotes and the occasional panther, bobcats, owls, Ferrell dogs and deer they all can make weird sounds.  But this, this is crazy.  I never thought that I would hear something like that in my woods.  I live in the river bottoms and I remember when I was young we heard the same sound, that was over thirty years ago. When I thought back on what happened, I realized that before we left the house my inside dog and cat were acting strange, pacing and panting. When we exited the house to go to the garden I should have known something was not quite right.  There were no night time sounds.. No crickets or frogs .. Just silence.. I finally put on my brave face and escorted my daughter to her car and pretended like everything is ok.  I could still hear snaps and cracks in the woods.  I watched her drive off then quickly got back in the house.  In the morning......I'll go look for other evidence, for now you couldn't pay me to go outside and I don't spook easy at all! When I calmed down I am sure I will wish I had walked towards the sound, but for now... I am glad I am inside.","Approximatley .5 miles from the Gasconade River.

"First off I would like to say that I am not one to normally see much of anything, I am a believer in the possibility of many things but rarely see them.  In this instance, again I didn't so much see anything as hear it. The first incident took place in the middle of November of 2012.  It was in a rural area of Missouri outside the city of Rayville.  The area is a mix of farm and woodland.  It was approximately 9pm when I drove to a friend's house.  As I was walking from my car to his door I noticed what sounded like someone or something big walking about 30 or 40 yards away from me in the woods. It was just beyond the range of what I could see into the woods. When I stopped walking it stopped walking and when I started to walk it began again.  It was only about a 40 foot walk to the door and I walked slowly as I tried to figure this out.  About half way I stopped to think and it stopped once more.  From what I heard it was a sound of only 2 feet walking and was large.  It didn't sound at all like a 4 foot creature like a deer.  I went in to tell my friend but when we came out there was no sound.  About a week later I came out again and was walking to the door and jokingly called out ""are you there bigfoot?"" and laughed to myself. As I approached the door something flew out of the woods and hit my friends car.  Later in the evening when I left, in the distance I heard dogs going crazy and the sound of something large screaming.  It has been several weeks since I last heard anything but my friend says he too has heard the sound of something walking in the woods.  I have thought about if it was a person possibly playing a joke but no one knew I was going there.  Thought about it being another animal but it sounded too big to be a deer.  It has me extremely curious so I would love some feedback and your thoughts.  As I say I am not one quick to jump to conclusions and tend to be the first to look for other causes to things.","This happened near Rayville, Mo.

"It was a dark night and I heard the dogs all barking from their cages, which was not that unusual as they would do this whenever a coyote would come close or a car would drive by. I grabbed my flashlight and turned on the back motion light and went outside with my .22 mag revolver thinking a coyote had stirred them. I hollered at the dogs to hush and they would not at first, but eventually did. It was at this time that I heard something walking in the woods behind the house that sounded as though it was on two legs. I then assumed that it had to be a person and called out asking if anyone was there. Immediately afterwards the walking stopped and I called out again as I began walking towards this little dirt road that separated our back yard from the woods. At this point it sounded as though the footsteps were coming towards me. Not wanting to shoot someone accidentally and still wanting to be safe I went back to the dog kennel and let out our red heeler who I add is usually fearless. I told her come ""come"" and began walking back towards the woods, the dog ran up to the treeline ears pointing up and alert and immediately ran back to her cage. I have never seen that dog back down from anything before or since so I yelled out one more time for whoever was out there that I was armed and to leave now.

"In the year of 2002/2003 around 3:00 am during the summertime I was leaving my girlfriend's house in Dover, Missouri which is located on the Missouri River bluffs. At the time there were only two houses located in that area on Coal Mine Road. One of the properties was owned by Kerr Orchard, which was in the midst of its apple season, and the other property was owned by the Dunkel family who raised livestock. I was driving (Blue Ford Escort ZX2) south on Coal Mine Road from my girlfriend's house on the gravel road approaching the S-curve. As I rounded the first half of the S-curve, my headlights lit up a large, dark, sparkly/reflective object with yellow eye glow in the middle of the road. I began to slow down my car, and the reflective object hurried to the side of the road still on all fours. As I got closer to the unknown object, initially I thought it was a black bear which is uncommon in this area. All of a sudden, the object stood up on two feet broadsided and froze as I continued to approach it in my car. At this time I observed an unknown creature that was fully covered in extremely long (approximately eight to ten inches long), matted hair. The hair was black and gray and fully covered the creature except for the chest/shoulder area where the creature's skin appeared to be much lighter. I could see large, pectoral muscles in the creature, and at this time I knew the unknown creature was a male. The creature had very broad shoulders and extremely long arms that hung down beyond its kneecaps. I could not see the face or hands because of the long hair covering its body. The creature appeared to be approximately eight feet tall and towered above my vehicle as I was about fifteen feet away from it still driving slowly down the gravel road. I would estimate him to be five hundred or more pounds and was solid muscle. When I passed him, I was so scared and down shifted my clutch to second almost killing my engine. As I continued my drive home to Lexington, Missouri, I could not believe what I had encountered. The next day I told my mom/dad and brothers about what I saw. Before the sighting I have driven home from that area in Dover, Missouri for 5 years and have never seen anything like it before.  There is no question about what I saw that night.

"Went for a weekend hiking and camping trip with 4 family members.  We hiked about a mile and a half down an established trail before making a turn into the brush to find our camping spot just after sunset on the first night.  we probably hiked about 400 yards into the brush before setting up camp and turning in for the night as it began to rain.  I was woken up about 4:30am by a very strong odor that smelled just like a skunk, so much so that I assumed a skunk had made it into our camp and I zipped up the shell on my sleeping bag to avoid being sprayed.  The odor went away so I relaxed a bit more and tried to get back to sleep when I smelled it again only this time I had an overwhelming feeling I was being watched from directly behind me.  I rolled over to look and was able to make out a sillouette of a very broad shouldered shadow and head between two trees about 7 yards from where I was laying.  I immediately turned around and waited for daybreak, still unsure if I had seen anything or just imagined it I sat waiting and listening for anything aggressive in nature and it didn't happen so I chaulked it up to an overactive imagination but was still uneasy about staying in this location.  I said nothing to my family but I was determined to not let the camp fire die out on the second night.  The second night came and it rained again, we could hear the sound of what I would describe as a very loud owl.  We turned in for the night and all my family fast asleep let the fire get to the verge of dying, easily helped by the falling rain.  Sounds were all around the campsite but not really unexpected in a dry rotting forrest during some steady rains.  I got up to tend the fire and as the firelight grew it seemed the forrest sounds intensified, again probably just nerves.  I'm not an avid outdoorsman but I love the minor amount of time I do get to spend in the wilds.  It was about 3:30am at this time and one of my family members woke up and helped me with the fire, sensing my uneasyness he suggested I use his hammock to get some rest and he would watch the fire.  I got a couple hours sleep and woke up around 5:30am still before daybreak and my family member proceeded to tell me that about 15 minutes prior he heard a very loud crash in the forest and then another less intense crash directly behind the hammock where I was then sleeping.  It had alarmed him enough that he had his handgun out and ready but he said he didn't see anything and I still didn't say a word about what I thought I may have seen the night prior.  I actually did not tell anyone until we were on our way home and I told my brother about what I thought I saw, mostly out of fear of ridicule.  It wasn't until we got home and I started doing some research that I became more convinced of what I think I saw on the first night and what I smelled.  During our time at this campsite the rain stopped during the day and we were able to hike around the area probably covering almost 2 miles and one of things that struck us was the complete lack of any wildlife.  We saw a woodpecker and heard the sounds of birds chirping on the first morning, but that was it, nothing not a single rabbit, squirrel, dear, bird or anything other than that woodpecker and a few fish in a nearby creek were seen in the area.  We did come across some animal droppings that looked almost like rabbit droppings only smoother.  We only stayed two nights even though we had planned on 4 nights total, fearing more rain we left early.","It was near Bell Mountain, I didn't drive to the area so I wasn't really paying attention to the area.

"I had just dropped my father off at his home at 1:50 AM in De Soto Missouri as I made my way down from Highway B onto NN heading north to my hometown Pacific MO. I was taking my time down NN traveling at around 30 mph to avoid any deer collisions due to the fact it is deer season.  I had seen frequent deer so I am very keen with knowing what animals in a field look like, especially through the peripheral vision of car headlights. I was about 5 miles from the Franklin County line when I saw a rabbit dart across the road and I slammed the brakes to avoid hitting it. I was at a 5 mph rolling stop when I looked where the rabbit had run from and I saw a 7 to 8 foot tall ape like animal running on it's hind legs at my vehicle as if it were aggressively charging at me. I did not get a look at it's face other than the clear outline of the creature. I was very frightened at the site, and the sense of knowing it was an animal not native to Missouri, and it had just made me start to reconsider what I had just seen. I have recently heard of the Missouri MOMO, and I have been very skeptical about it. I would like to know what animal in Missouri could run at that speed on it's hind legs, surely a Bear cannot. I also cannot understand why I would have angered a Bear in anyway from just stopping in the road. I debated on whether or not I should report this, because a lot of people treat you like an idiot when you tell them what you saw. I thank you for taking the time to read my report.

"I was living with my daughter and son-in-law while my new home was being built. They live just down the road from me. A friend of mine had asked me to drive her to Montana at that time, so we left and I was gone for at least a week.  When I returned, it was around 11:00 at night somewhere around the first part of October 2000. I parked my truck down next to the barn area and walked up towards the house.  Off to my immediate right I heard this hair raising guttural growl.  My mind was racing...was this one of my nephews bull cows, or was it a deer, but none of those fit anything like that sound. I thought my feet would never get me to the door of the house. This sound was done once again. I finally went in and told my family what I had heard. My son-in-law insisted that it must have been a bear. I have hunted all of my life and know all of the animal sounds, including a bear. The next morning I called the Conservation office, and they put a gentleman on the phone and I related to him what had happened. I even made a similance of the sound the best I could. He said that he and his wife go to Alaska all the time to study bear and he had never heard anything like that and it definitely wasn't a bear. The next night, my other daughter and I were upstairs getting ready for bed around 11:00 p.m again and had the windows open. I heard the same sound again out my bedroom window. I quickly turned out the lights, and my daughter crawled from her room to mine to see if she could also hear it. By then, the sound had stopped. Several days later in the eveming, my grandaughter, grandson, and I believe another grandson were playing outside the garage door which was raised up about 3 feet. They heard this loud guttural sound also very close to the same place I had heard it originally and rolled under the garage door as fast as possible. Since that time, several of my family have had some very scary encounters with this sound near their houses. We live in a very wooded cedar and hardwood area with a year round creek. I would like to relate all of these incidents, but they are fairly numerous. I would be glad to tell you, and introduce you to the ones who have had these various experiences. These creatures have lived in this area for many years. My youngest son who is in college now, was out hunting with his friend. They were both about 11 years old at the time, and were hunting up a powerline when they saw what they thought was person, but realized it had hair on it like a gorilla, and it was shaking a fairly good sized cedar tree, which we assume it was trying to shake something out of it. They both turned and left the woods very quickly.",[Details removed by witness request],Franklin County,Missouri,Fall,Report 20677: Resident describes possible vocalizations near Robertsville.,38.40685,-90.7,10/9/2002,20677,Class B,9yzd2pf20g,68.11,58.865,49.62,50.09,0.73,0.45,0.12,0,0,,1020.06,Overcast in the morning.,5,9.96,183,0.73
"Myself and 3 friends went to a game access area close to Smithville Lake where myself and several other young men had witnessed a pair of red eyes looking at us in October or November of 2011.

We walked around for a little while and didn't hear anything so we went back to the jeep and waiting with the windows cracked. We stayed there quietly chatting for around an hour or an hour and a half, then we felt a strange feeling and decided to leave. The driver turned the car on and the passenger pointed and screamed. Off the front of the car about 30 yards was a large figure squatted down looking at us with red eyes. The driver attempted to turn around and almost hit the creature in his frenzy of getting turned around. Myself and the passenger, as i was sitting behind the passenger, got within 7 or 8 feet of the creature through the window. The face still haunts me to this day and I have trouble writing about it these 6 years on. It was much more human like than I ever would have guessed. Simply horrifying and still gives me nightmares.

"This happened about 1982, in the area of Steelville Missouri. We were camping on the Meremac River. The group consisted of myself, my wife, my son, my daughter and a friend and his wife. The place we camped was on an elderly ladies farm. There were about 5 other campsites, all about 30 yards apart, with our campsite being on the end and closest to where the woods became thick. There was a dirt road that went from our spot into the woods a short distance. While myself and my friend were gathering fire wood, my son...about 7 at the time, sat at the begining of the road playing in the dirt. My wife said all of a sudden he looked down the road, jumped up and made a bee line for her, all the time yelling "" Mommy a big black man. My friend and I heard him screaming and ran back to camp to see what was wrong. I know my son was young at the time, but I'd never seen him so upset. He kept repeating that he saw a big black man standing part way down the road. Now at the time, we lived in St. Louis and my son was used to seeing black people but he insisted this man was differant. After we calmed him down he told us the man was real tall. Way taller than me or my friend, who was about 6'2'. He also insisted the man wasn't wearing clothes but was covered with black hair. My friend and I were both armed and decided to take a look down the road. It was getting dark by then and we didn't see or hear anything out of the ordinary except it did smell like something dead was close. There was to be a huge meteore shower that night so we walked out into a pasture to have a clear view of the sky. The pasture bordered the woods on our left, with our camp and the river to our front. We hadn't been sitting there long when we heard something heavy walking around in the woods. At first we thought it might be a stray cow but the more we listened it sounded more like the way a man would move. What really got our attention was that all of a sudden we heard limbs snapping. Not small ones but big enough to sound like rifle shots. I'm a Vietnam Vet and a long time hunter. I've never heard anything move through woods like that. It spooked us enough that even though we were armed, both carrying .44 cal hand guns, we didn't venture into the woods to investigate. That ended our star gazeing and we spent most of the rest of the night sitting in camp with our pistols close at hand. The next day we found where something had bulldozed it's way through the heavy bush and left some good sized broken limbs and saplings in its wake, but to be honest we didn't look too close. Also the smell of something dead was gone. The rest of the camping trip was un eventfull though I did notice one thing. The lady who's land we were camping on was carrying a 12 gage shotgun every time we saw her. She even had it across her lap when she'd sit on her porch. Never knew her to do that before. She was of old hillbilly stock and not one to scare easy so I asked her about it. She just replied she wanted it close and would say no more. To sum it up, My son's insisting he saw a very big hairy black man, the way it frightened him,the noise that night and the broken trail of brush and limbs, the smell and the elderly ladies keeping her shotgun  close at hand, I have to wonder. Especially since I read, here on your site, of other bigfoot sightings in the area.","Can't remember the exact directions to get there,  my brother in law would know as he grew up in the area and has family there, but it's about mid way, on the river, between Meramec Springs and Onondaga Cave.",Crawford County,Missouri,Summer,Report 6775: Child has daylight sighting along Meramec River,38.11203,-91.1569,12/5/2004,6775,Class B,9yz0vdjddm,49.92,49.415,48.91,36.92,0.75,,0.78,0.0021,1,rain,,Drizzle in the morning and afternoon.,0,,180,6.94
"This past October I was walking along Mattox Dr, by City Lake Park in Sullivan Missouri. It was around 11, 11 20 PM on a Thursday night and the park is remote and empty on a night like that. I am 29 and stand 6 foot 6 inches. My vision is 15/20 in my left eye, better than normal. As I came around the curb, I had the National Preserve, Meramec State Park to my right. As I looked ahead some 70 to 100 feet and I saw this tall monkey with long legs go by under one of the lights. I immediately looked to my right at the three line as fear overwhelmed my body. I turned around, pacing myself back towards town, trying to make sense of what I saw. It stood about 7 feet, and it was hairy, the hair of the arms was hanging 3, to 4 inches, it was the only part of the silhouette that was clearly hairy and I could notice clearly that it had ape like hairy arms. I went back to the house and researched the subject on you tube, but most of the videos showed a much heavier set creature. A lot of people that I talked to just can not believe me. Last night I came across the Jacobs video and the similarity struck me. I know that is hard to believe what I saw and I myself was a skeptic of this phenomenon, until it happened to me. Now I know that the creature in cause exists. Do we know why it is so elusive? It seams that it was leaving the park when it saw me? Why would a creature so large be scared of a human?

"Two friends and myself were driving back roads in our home town out of boredom in the evening. We stopped at a small conservation area known as Riverside off a dirt road that shares the same name. There is a boat ramp off the Meremac River and a picnic table about 50 yards off the road and obstructed by woods and brush. There are trash barrels at the location and fishermen empty their coolers and discard fishing waste when they take their boats out of the water. There are farms and residences in the area, but nothing for about half a mile due to the area's proclivity to flood. There have also been incidents of violence in this location in the past (person on person) so there's a local aversion to the area, which makes it particularly absent of people at night. The three of us were talking and walking down the boat ramp to the edge of the river (the trees and brush make the ramp the only place that the river is visible in this area). There is a small gravel bar/island that is heavily wooded about 200 feet from the edge of the boat ramp where the river forks and splits. There was a decent amount of moon light and we were watching the water. We heard some noise in the brush on the island or maybe the opposite bank. A few moments passed and what sounded likes a rock hit the bank on our side (maybe fifteen or twenty feet down river) followed by what sounded like another rock landing in the river (presumably in the same vicinity of the first rock). We froze for maybe ten seconds, then we heard what we all collectively determined to sound like an ape yowling from about the same direction of the noises and rocks. I would say the sound was more like a one tone, moderately deep exhale or grunt that had a shrill undertone that gave it an aggressive feeling. We left immediately. We've all lived in rural areas for most of our lives and know the sounds of local wildlife. This sound wasn't one any of us had encountered before.

"I don't know what to think.  I have visited this website many, many times and was impressed by what I have read and the research you do.  I have to add what I have experienced. First a little background on me: I am 60 years old and work for the U.S. Government.  I have been camping for most of my life and was an Adult Boy Scout Leader and Trainer for approx. 20 years.  I have been hunting for over 30 years as well.  I know the animals that inhabit the woods in Missouri. I own 80 fenced acres of private property in the Mark Twain National Forest in Dent County Missouri.  I am bordered on the southeast 40 acres by a farm and on the northwest 40 acres by a farm.  The rest is all National Forest on all sides of my property.  On my property there is a wet weather creek that almost always has a little water in it.  My property is mostly oak forest with about 10 acres of open space that was once used for grazing cattle.  There is a pine foreset on the northeast side where an old logging road is our entrance to the property. I have heard some strange vocalizations since buying the property over 3 years ago.  I have heard the same or similar sounds or ""vocalizations"" on this website.  I know what bobcat, coyote, screech owls, barred owls and most other ""forest animals and birds"" sound like and these vocalizations don't sound like any of these.  I have also heard the banging of wood on trees in the woods around me at night. I was staying overnight at this ""farm/hunting cabin"" of mine on the weekend of 15-17 April 2005.  There was a 3/4 moon out and the nights were very clear and somewhat cool (about 48-52 degrees on Friday & Saturday nights) but I had the window cracked as I like to go to sleep to the ""night sounds"".  I had just gone to bed (about 10:30PM) on Friday night when I heard the ""night sounds"" completely stop.  About 4-5 minutes later I heard an incredibly loud screech or scream come from somewhere close and from the southwest of my ""farm/hunting cabin"" (probably within 200-300 yards at the most).  About 30 seconds later there was an answering vocalization from quite a ways off and to the southeast.  This repeated 4 different times.  Each time the vocalizations got closer together and the one closest to my cabin got farther away towards the southeast.  Between the 2nd and 3rd vocalizations I heard a banging like a board was being smacked against a tree.  There was 3 load bangs from close to me and then three (almost answering) bangs from the vocalization farther away.  After the 4th vocalization (which seemed very close to each other and farther from me) all the vocalizations and tree banging stopped.  About 3-4 minutes later the whippoorwills started in and the ""night sounds"" came back to the woods. On Saturday night it was very much like the night before except there were no vocalizations or tree banging, just the ""night sounds"" ceasing and about 3-4 minutes later the window right next to my bed (on the outside this window is about 4 feet from the ground to the bottom of the window and the window is 2' wide and 3' tall) went completely dark as if something stood outside and blocked out the moon and stars at the window.  This ""blackout"" only lasted for 2-5 seconds. I don't know exactly how long for sure as I was practically holding my breath and trying to be as quiet as possible.  I even reached for my pistol just to be safe.  I had the window slightly open and DID NOT smell anything special like I have read about.  I did smell what smelled like a wet dog and there were no dogs around that weekend.  I should know as I have 2 Labrador Retrievers and a Rottweiler, none of which where with me at the time.  I did go to the door, after the moonlight came back in through the window, and turned on the porch light to see if I could see what had blocked out the moonlight.  There was nothing there and there was not even a cloud in the night sky.  I was alone at the ""farm/hunting cabin"" doing some scouting for the upcoming Turkey season.  The next morning I looked under the window and as much as 10 feet away for any sign of footprints but there was nothing there.  The ground was covered by leaf clutter all around the ""farm/hunting cabin"" and I couldn't find any trace of footprints in the dry  leaves.  I don't know what this was but if someone wants to call me they can",Withheld at witness request.,Dent County,Missouri,Spring,Report 11453: Vocalizations and wood knocking in Mark Twain National Forest.,37.63169,-91.41383,4/15/2005,11453,Class B,9ywypfdkrr,78.74,,,31.71,0.27,,0.22,0,0,,,Clear throughout the day.,0,,79,2.07
"Overview: Dates - Oct. 17 -20, 2002 Location - Douglas County, MO near Dora, MO - Mark Twain National Forest Campground off CC Highway, North Fork, Campsite #20 (Pine loop). Evidence - Loud calls, rock/boulder throwing, footprints, displaced log in middle of lower trail, multiple incidents. Witnesses - Myself and camping partner, Carl. No other campers were in the entire park on 10/17/02. Incident #1 10/17/02 approx 7:30-8:00 PM After eating dinner my camping partner and I were sitting in front of the large camp fire facing the stream (North Fork of the White river). It was an extremely quiet night. No crickets, or locusts or frogs/toads could be heard at all. It was very quite. We were talking and listening to music. Over the music I heard an animalistic sounding call out of my right ear. I heard it twice before I asked Carl if he heard it. To me it sounded about 150 - 200 yards away, upstream and on the opposite side of the stream up on the bluffs over looking the stream. He said, ""I hear something"". I jumped up and turned off the music. Immediately after turning off the music we both heard a similar call from downstream approximately 50-100 yards away. It sounded as though it was coming from the upper path running parallel to the stream. The campsite (#20 - Pine Loop) was unique as it was created in the middle of the upper trail. In other words, someone walking the trail would actually walk right in the middle of the campsite. The call was very unusual. It sounded initially somewhat canine. When I first heard the second call I was unsure of my original impression of the first call coming from upstream. Carl and I are both avid outdoor/camping enthusiasts. Carl 50-60 years old and has been an outdoorsman most of his life. I am 30-40 years old and have been camping many times as a child, with Carl twice per year for the last 10 years, and with my own family. We have both heard many identifiable animal calls while in the forest. This was an animal call that was unlike anything we had ever heard, or seen on any documentary or while camping. To describe the sound this animal made is difficult. It began the call as a canine type ""howl"" followed by a ""whoop"" or ""bark"" repeated several times. This was NOT a coyote or wolf. The pitch was much deeper and tonal quality gave the impression of something larger than a coyote or wolf. The animal made 2-3 of these ""howl/whoops"" and then was silent. During the silence Carl and I speculated as to the source. We immediately ruled out coyote and wolf as we had both heard those animals in the past. We heard no movement of the animal during the silence - but we were talking/whispering to each other and could have missed any movement sounds. 30-45 seconds after the downstream calls, what we believed to be the same animal let out a call the truly defies description. The animal was now almost directly in front of us if not slightly downstream. The sound appeared to come from the lower path running parallel to the stream just in front of us. This would make the animal approx 35 yards away between the campsite and the stream. The call was another ""howl/whoop"" combination repeated 2-3 times. It was so loud that the echo from behind me was almost equal to the original sound in volume. It was a ""blood curdling"" call. Clearly the animal was either posturing or warning us. I felt the call was directed specifically to us. The call was almost human - but would have had to be a very large tall human. The depth and volume of the call indicated to me an animal of a minimum of 150 - 200 pounds. For the first time in my 38 years, an animal call triggered my ""fight or flight response"". I immediately picked up a large knife and felt an almost over-whelming urge to loudly scream back into the darkness and to rush toward the sound. My adrenaline was pumping. I said to Carl that I felt the sound resembled a large human imitating a wolf. That the call was very ""exaggerated"" and was clearly meant to scare us. We speculated that someone might be playing a hoax on us. Carl responded that he felt this was a close description of the sound. Just as he said those words, not more than 5 seconds after the end of the loud call in front of us, we heard a second animal make the SAME call from 150 yeards or so UPSTREAM. When we heard the second animal make an identical call, we knew we were not dealing with a human prank. I am a musician. The second animal was not a human being. The second animal's tonal characteristics and depth matched the first animals almost identically. We humans have such different voices. I would have been able to differentiate the two human voices from each other if it was a prank. When we heard the second animal we knew we were hearing something neither of us could explain. It was NOT human, it was NOT a coyote or wolf, it could not be explained. The second animal seemed to be giving it's location to the first. The first animal seemed ""male"" or parental. The second animal seemed ""female"". Within 30 seconds, The first animal seemed to have moved from in front of us and was now approx 75 -100 yards upstream and on the opposite bank where it met up with the second animal. Both animals then gave 2-3 howling/whoops. Immediately following both animals began a series of completely different sounds. These were very spooky sounding. The sounds were very fast, gutteral and rising and falling in pitch. It sounded like a language to me. It sounded as though they were having a very emotional verbal argument. It was almost like a cross between a gorilla's grunt and a witch's cackle. Then it sounded as if both animals ran further up stream and over the bluff. The enitre series of calls lasted approximately 5-7 minutes. Incident #2 10/17/02 approx 9:45 -10:00 PM. I had gone into the tent to sleep at approx 9:30. Carl followed a little later - approx 10-15 minutes. Immediately after Carl entered the tent we heard one animal make the same ""howl/whoop"" combination 2-3 times and then silence. It appeared to come from the upstream direction about 100-150 yards away. Incident #3 10/18/02 appox 02:00 AM I was awakened by a very loud crashing sound. I heard the sound 2-3 times before I woke Carl up. The sound appeared to some from slightly upstream - maybe 20 yeards or less. The sound was VERY loud. It sounded as if very LARGE (minimum of 20 pound - possibly 100 pound or greater) boulders were being purposely thrown in the stream. The boulders were so large that the sound had to parts. The first was the object hitting the water, the second was the object hitting the river bed itself. It was a ""Splat-boom Boom"" cannon type sound. Carl had been snoring loudly (as do I) prior to waking up. This sound happened at least 12 times over a 5 minute period. I stated to Carl - ""This shows intelligence and strength"". I believe it was still trying to scare us off. Immediately after the last boulder impact we heard one of two animals make a very brief ""howl/whoop"" (1-2 times). It was as if the animal wanted to place his signature on the boulder throwing. Incident #4 10/18/02 While exploring the lower path 20 yards from our campsite, Carl discovered a large log blocking the path. This water soaked log was completely out of place. It did not come from any surrounding trees. When I attempted to pick it up it crumbled in my grasp. We did not see the log on the path on 10/17/02 - however it was dark and we could have missed it. It appeared to also be a ""message"" - as though something wanted to block our path downstream. Incident #5 10/19/02 10:00 AM While walking on the upper path downstream approx 40-75 yards from our campsite, Carl and I found 2 foot prints. They were approx 14 inches in length. The heel and ball of the print appeared very human like - very similar to ""Big Foot"" prints and casts I have seen in various medias. However, the toes were very different. The clearest print showed this to be a THREE-TOED Creature. I am NOT CRAZY. I could not believe only three toes. The toes were very human if not ""pod-like"" in appearance. We took several pictures of the clearest print. We did not have the materials to make a cast. Carl felt the print might not even lend itself to casting. We did get several pictures of the prints. We could not identify any other charateristics from the prints. I will say this - as with the loudest call from directly in front of us - I believe whatever made these prints is very large. A minimum of 6.5 feet tall and 250 pounds. More likely my ""instincts"" tell me it is 7-8 foot tall and 350-500 pounds. It appeared from the angle of the prints that the animal came down the trail and was alarmed/suprised/angry to see our camp blocking the middle of the trail. The trail was hard packed and yielded no prints. The prints found were just off the side of the trail and in very soft and somewhat wet soil.  Incident #6 Unlike the evening of 10/17/02. The evening of 10/18 and 10/19 brought scattered rain showers. Depsite the rain, the forest was NOT eerily quiet as it was on 10/17. Crickets, frogs, etc. were very loud on 10/18 and 10/19.

"My four year old son and I were visiting my parents who lived in Lonedell, Missouri. My mother was napping, my father was at work (he helped farm there on the land--they lived in a trailer on the about 350 acres owned by their landlord). I was sitting on the front porch with my son and my parent's dog, Buddy. It was mid-afternoon, probably between 1 and 3 pm. I noticed something or someone walking in the field connected to the front yard coming in our direction. My first instinct was to get my baby and get inside. However, I could not help but stand in the doorway, screen door closed but the wooden door open just enough for me to peer through. Whatever that thing was, it kept coming closer to the trailer. By this time, Buddy (the dog) was timidly barking. I could tell from his bark that he was threatened but afraid. I felt bad leaving the dog out on the porch alone, but was too afraid to go out there. The thing (for lack of a known word to call what it was that I saw)was walking, on two legs, aimlessly, not in a hurry and I could not find a reason as to why it came into the yard as it was just looking around aimlessly and leisurely walking. There was a wooden fence, mostly for decoration and only about 20 feet long, that the thing walked next to. My mother had some decorations (can't remember what) hanging on the fence that the thing seemed to look at. The dog barking did not startle the creature, it just kept walking. I was absolutely astounded by what I was seeing; if not for the fact that the dog was seeing it too, I would have wondered if my eyes and/or brain was playing tricks on me. I decided to be brave and opened the screen door just enough to stick my head outside. That's when the thing looked at me, met my gaze. I just stood there, half afraid of it's reaction and it's next move but more curious than anything. My heart was racing. I held my son up to look at it also, still indoors. After it looked at me and yet showed no fear I had more time to study it and I was racking my brain to identify what it was that I was seeing. Here is the best description I can give...It was between 4-6 feet tall, walking on two legs, covered from head to toe in very long white hair. It's face was mostly covered in white hair as well, except for it's eyes and maybe it's mouth. It did not have the snout like a dog, it's shape and build was that of a human's. I even compared it to a bear in my head, but their were not enough similarities. This thing was not very animalistic in behavior--the way it walked and looked at me were more typical of human behaviors. Yet, the way it wandered and seemed oblivious to the man-made things around it (cars, the trailer, even the fence) was more like the characteristics of an animal. I did not get the feeling that it was aggressive or wanting to cause harm. Yet, because of the size and animalistic nature of it, I knew that it was strong and could hurt me, my son, or the dog. It began to walk around the side of the garage, out of my sight, but closer towards the end of the trailer that had the bedroom my mom was napping in. I ran down into the bedroom and began frantically looking out the windows searching to see where it had gone. i woke my mother up in my tizzy and quickly told her what I had seen and I wanted her to look. She was still half-asleep and slow to process what I was saying. I did not see where it went from there. I could not locate it through the windows and I was much too afraid to go outside and look. My mom, my son, and I all sat and talked about what I had seen that afternoon. I was still shook up about it. My son was able to confirm to my mother that it was not a dog, not a bear. The fact that we both saw and heard that dog barking at it helped to convince my mom that it wasn't a human or another dog, bear, etc. My mom said that people down the road have two big white dogs--but like I told her, this thing was walking on two legs, not on all fours like a dog. For many other reasons, I knew it was not a dog. I'd never seen a bear in real life before, but I am sure it was not a bear either. I had heard of and seen animated Yetis on a pc game before. That was the closest thing I could match to what I had seen. I knew then and know now that many people do not believe Yetis are real--but whatever it was that I saw that day makes me wonder if they are in fact real and if that is what I saw. I believe it was late summer when this happened. Nice weather, sunny day. Like I said, mid-afternoon and it was out in the open. There were clear farmlands all around us. One pond stocked with fish and swans right next to the end of the trailer that it went in the direction of. There were also two other ponds on the land. I know that a lot of the 350 acres was wooded. Also, there was a road about 300 feet from where the thing was and also from where I was. There was only about 150 feet between myself and the creature. I'm not good at mathematical estimations, but I was as close as I would have wanted to be to whatever that was. It looked as if it could have made about 10 strides to me in a very short amount of time, so I stayed inside. I've read a few of the other sightings here on your sight, but all that I have read are of people seeing creatures covered in dark brown or almost black long hair. That wasn't the case with me. The description of the hair being that it was very long and covered the whole creature, not tangled, matted, or dissarrayed, but it was a blinding white color--didn't even look dirty or yellowed. I wish I could remember its hands or feet, but I can't. I can say that it's eyes were bigger than that of a human's and seemed very dark. Other than when we met each other's gaze, it had it's head looking down so I could not see it's eyes or facial features well if at all. It did not make any noises at all. It hardly made any sounds while walking. This happened about 5 years ago and I have not forgotten it--never will forget it. In fact, my son still remembers seeing it as well. I told my dad about it when he got home--he couldn't tell me what it was either, had not seen anything like that before. I've told my husband, my brother, some friends--no one can relate to what I saw or help me to name what it was. I often wish I could go back to that day and be less afraid and more willing to study it, to even sit outside and watch it instead of hiding inside. I doubt I will ever see anything like that again, and yet I don't know if I really want to, lol. I hope this helps with your work in some way. I had no idea that there have been so many sightings of similar creatures in Missouri and in our country as a whole. I'm going to look through some more stories of sightings after I submit this--I'm curious to see if anyone else has reported a white creature before. It feels great to share my story with someone who might be able to tell me what it was that I saw that day--someone who might have seen something like this before themselves.

"On 4-11-03 my son came running to the house screaming let me in..let me in. He was shaking and very upset. He said the woods monster was going to get him. I asumed his older brother had scared him. I confronted his brother and told him to quit scaring his brother. He said he was not even near him and wanted to know why he was crying in such hystericks. When I asked my son again he said it was not his brother...it was the woods monster. I went outside to the back yard, our house sets at the edge of a big woods just up from a river. I smelled something musky, I then had a good idea what he might have seen. My son is 5yrs old, He knows nothing of bigfoot other than the monster truck. When asked again he said it was just looking at him, I asked was he small or...before I could say anymore he said no, he was big like this...pointing to the ceiling in our livingroom. My wife asked, why do you say he...my son replied..he's just like us only bigger. Then I asked him if he smelled anything. He said yes it stunk like a skunk. We laughed at what he said and decided to drop it so he could calm down and sleep that night. The next morning he came to our bed, I asked him if he was going outside today...he said no..then said if he did he would not go near the woods. My wife asked if he could draw what he saw. He said yes. He took a piece of printer paper and got his crayons. He dumped out the crayons and after a second or so said Do you seen the brown crayon. I told him it was still in the crayon tin. He first drew a big rectangle and colored it brown. Then he took the red and drew arms and legs and head. He also drew some squigly line around it, those were the branches he was looking through. Then I got on the computer, I found the picture of the Patterson film. As soon as the picture materialized on the screen my son backed up and said THATS IT. I beleve my son 100% because abot 20-21yrs ago I seen something similar not 200yrds in the same woods. And in 1975 my now brother-in-law saw the same thing not 10 miles or so from here. I just found out today that some people not more than 3 miles from here had some kind of an incident the night after my son seen what he saw. If interested in the other stories you may contact me. I wished that my sons encounter not list any names due to ridicule from people in the area. Myson had to many right answers to what he saw for someone who didn't even know this thing exists. I dont talk about my encounter, and never have around my sons. And we monitor what they watch on tv. He had all the right answers.

"The events of that I am about to relate to you happened on August 9, 2002. just outside of Springfield Missouri. It was about 2:00am. My son and I had driven out into the country to get away from the city lights to watch the Persudes meteor Shower. We drove south on Hwy ZZ and stopped at the top of a large hill. We turned west onto a gravel road and stopped on the top of a hill. There were no close by trees or structures to interfere with our viewing of the night sky. It was a clear night with no moon. After a few minutes in the dark our eyes adjusted quite well. We could see the open fields to the East and south and north of us. Looking west we could see the light colored road going down the hill and off into the distance. After watching the sky for a few minutes I noticed out of the corner of my eye something large moving in the field south of us. At first I couldn't tell if I was actually seeing something or not, when I looked directly at it I couldn't see it but then if I looked  off center of it I could see it in my peripheral vision. At times it seemed to be moving west then east. I realized it was zigzagging back and forth. I asked my son if he saw it but he didn't. About then there was a flurry of shooting stars and I diverted attention to the sky again figuring it must have been a cow or a deer. After a few minutes both my son and I were facing north east when we heard a very deep and loud growl from behind us. Almost together we turned to each other and said"" did you hear that"". Turning around we both could see a large object in the road. We could not make out any details except its outline against the light colored roadway. It was huge, it seemed to have a roughly man like shape but a kind of cone head and extremely wide shoulders. It was swaying back and forth about half way down the hill. After watching it for a few seconds I realized that it was swaying back and forth because it was walking up the hill toward us. At this time it growled yet again, a very low deep rumble like growl. I noticed how quiet everything else was. In fact I remember thinking how funny it was that the thing made no sound on the gravel as it walked. By this time it was getting fairly close, perhaps three to four car lengths away. It growled once again very loud and what seemed unnaturally long. With that my son screamed ""lets get the hell out of here"" We jumped into our car and I floored it down the road and back to the highway. I didn't slow down till we hit town. The next day, (in full daylight of course) I went back out to the spot. I didn't find any tracks or anything. I did however notice that there was a 4 foot high barbwire fence between the field on the South and the road. If this thing was the same thing that I had seen in the field zigzagging across it would have had to step or jump the fence, as the fence was not strong enough for anyone to climb. Especially something as big as this. I do not know what it was but it obviously did not want us there and made no bones about it. I am very curious if anyone else in this area has seen anything similar recently.","South on Hwy ZZ to the Greene / Christian county line, turn west on side road.",Greene County,Missouri,Summer,Report 5286: Meteor watchers see large two-legged dark creature approach vehicle near Springfield,37.0968,-93.4303,8/9/2002,5286,Class A,9yte1cq0s0,88.01,77.205,66.4,55.3,0.56,0,0.03,0,0,,1018.99,Clear throughout the day.,10,9.66,122,4.78
"I grew up on a dairy farm, and would bring in the cows for the evening milking.  This was often done on horse back for both pleasure and convenience. Since I was only ten years old at the time I didn't have to actually milk the cows after they were at the barn, and could ride the horse while my brother and father milked. On the evening of the incident I was riding our appaloosa Gelding south from the barn lot toward the back of our farm. Most of our farm had been cleared by dozing eight years before, but the farm behind ours was completely overgrown,with trees,and brush, and it had not been used for anything for several years. The east boundry of our farm was a river, and there are many caves and sink holes in the area due to the karst topography.  As I mantioned above most of our farm was open so visability is good.  I had ridden about 100 yards west of the barn and was within about 100 yards of the back fence when Ace, our horse stopped walking. I kicked him in the ribs a little to get him going again, but he would only go a step or two and would stop again. This went on fow several minutes with me trying to force Ace who was a very well behaved horse to go forward.  I only managed to get him to go perhaps 20 or 30 yards, before he would go no further. All the while he was stamping his front feet, and snorting air out his nose in great puffs,as well as having his ears laid back against his head.  I was getting very frustrated with Ace, and was slapping the reigns against his flanks, and kicking my heels into him,but he would not go. At this time from behind a small cedar tree a large black humanoid  creature stood up, as though it had been crouched there hiding.  It turned toward the back fence of our farm, being just on our side of the fence.  I took four or five long strides walking upright then jumped the fence like a man would jump over something, rather like a great hop. I didn't get a chance to watch what ever it was because Ace turned and bolted back for the barn, and there was nothing I could do to stop him. I was barely able to stay in the saddle he was running so recklessly. I got my father and brother, and we went back to where I saw what ever it was but it was long gone. I remember that it was not covered with long stringy hair as these things are often reported, but was very dark from head to toe.I saw it from about 60 to 70 yards away,clearly with nothing between us until it jumped the fence. It was probably 6:00 to 6:30 pm, but it was only late September so it was still light out at the time.There were other occurrences in this area with screams, or cries at night, the sound of crashing movement in the brush near our house, and a putrid,rotten smell that when smelled while coon hunting would cause the hound to come back to us, and they would slink around at our heels with their tails between their legs. These things took happened over several years, but mine was the only actual sighting of anything, by my family.",,Greene County,Missouri,Fall,Report 9502: Young horse rider has daytime sighting near Ash Grove.,37.3317,-93.614,12/5/2004,9502,Class A,9ytkmu02gt,49.3,49.585,49.87,38.81,0.85,0.66,0.78,0.0084,1,rain,1011.64,Light rain until afternoon.,2,6.71,149,5.7
"On November 18, 2004  at approximately 6:45 pm, I was traveling south on a winding, dirt road less than 5 miles from my home on C Hwy between McDowell and East Purdy, Mo. As I drove along, I noticed ahead in the ditch line, an animal.  I know that there is a mule that often gets out nad roams the area, so I slowed down considerably so as not to hit her. As I got closer, it stood up, facing my Explorer.  Instead of moving into the headlight beam as a deer or something would do, it came at an angle from the ditch, towards the passenger side of my truck.   It was in my estimate, at least as tall as I am (5'8"") covered with hair.  The hair was a buff or light color. All I really remember at that point is hitting the lock button on my doors and screaming.  It came up to the passenger side window and I could see it's chest.   If I saw the face, I do not recall it, just the chest in the window.   I was screaming and hit the accelorator and sped away as fast as I could.   I don't know what it was, only that I have never seen anything like it before in my life. But, it does make me wonder about events that have happened around our house in the past.  In the spring of this year, my dogs started going crazy barking and I stepped out onto the porch to see what was wrong.   I hear a scream that I took to be  a mountain lion.   Knowing that I had a dog in the back pasture, I went to my truck and went to the back to let her into the main pasture with the other dogs.   I noticed on my way down to the back pasture that my very large dogs had all of my goats in a tight knot by the small barn and the dogs were in a semi-circle around the goats.  When I got to the back, to let the other dog in, I noticed that there was no sound at all in the woods nearby.  My dogs were silent.  The dog that I went down to get was terrified and rushed through the open gate as soon as I opened it.   I went back to the house and went to bed. The next day the neighbor told me that my dogs had fought something behind his house at about 3 am.   He didn't know what it was, only that it was large.  When I checked my dogs out, they did not have the slash cuts they would have had, if they had tangled with a mountain lion.  There were scrapes but that was about it. Our fence at the back of the place was also pushed down.  Our fence consists of cattle panels that are 52"" tall.   They are hooked to the post with heavy wire ties.  I can not bend the ties with my bare hands.  At the place where the fence was pushed down, the panel was loose from the post and the clips were in the brush.   AT the time I thought it odd, as a mountain lion would not have been capable of doing this.  A bear could, but not a cougar.",I can show you the place where I saw it.,Barry County,Missouri,Fall,Report 9840: Nighttime sighting on country dirt road,36.8133,-93.8232,12/6/2004,9840,Class A,9yt33j8j0b,58.71,49.985,41.26,51.97,0.95,,0.81,0.0232,1,rain,,Rain starting in the evening.,0,,175,3.51
"While traveling along Dark road skirting Monkey Mountain in NW Missouri, a tall thin creature of possibly 7' in height crossed the road in front of my vehicle. The creature was coming off the steep side of the hill heading towards the river areas. This animal was quite thin with sparse hair that was long and flowing, I got the impression it was quite old. It did not seem to notice I was there. It crossed the 10-12' wide roadway in approx. 3 strides, it was unhurried.

My brother and I were driving around at night looking for deer as we did often. He was driving.I spotted gold eyes to the left side of the road about eighty yards in front and ten yards off the road. It was standing with its back to a barbed wire fence in two to three foot tall sage grass. As we approached my brother slowed the truck and slightly turned to shine what it was.The thing was about six feet in height had long brown hair on its head and down his shoulders.the face was dark and we were unable to make out features. It was swaying side to side.As we passed by slowly I hollered stop but my brother kept going.Usually my brother stops when a good buck is spotted.

I noticed a large figure to the left of the Jeep running towards us. I looked at my Mom and asked her if she had seen what I seen, and she said yes. I asked her to describe what she had seen and she said that she had seen a large hairy man, or something running at us. We both came to the conclusion that it had to be a bigfoot. I hunt alot, and I have never seen anything like this in my life. I believe that what we witnessed that night was truly bigfoot... This creature looked to be about 8 ft tall...

"At the time of this occurrence we had been at Clarkco State Park for two nights in a cabin. The previous morning, Wednesday, October 20, 2010, I had walked the length of the cabin road to its dead end, turned around, and then walked the length of the cabin road all the way across the dam to the park headquarters building.   During this time I shot photos of leaf colors, a duck on the water, and various other things.  Nothing unusual was seen or heard that morning (morning of Wednesday, October 20, 2010). The following morning (Thursday, October 21, 2010) I awoke around 730AM.  My wife was still asleep.    I had a bite to eat, put on my clothes, got my digital camera, and headed out on the road towards the dam of Clarkco Lake to get some early morning photos.  The time I left the cabin was about 815AM CDT. The temp was down around 45 degrees that morning and there was a light fog coming off the lake.  The morning was completely clear – brilliant sunshine - with no overcast and some light breezes now and then. I tried to sneak up on some turtles that were out on a log to shoot a photo, but they were too quick for me.   All of them slipped into the water.  I shot a few photos of the lake, leaf colors, and the fog from the south end of the dam (the end away from the park headquarters building). After shooting several photos I headed back to the cabin on the road that led away from the dam.   When I was about 150 feet from our cabin I heard a distinct knocking sound like you would get if you were hitting a 2x4 with another 2x4, or maybe hitting a 2x4 with a hammer.   I thought there might be some carpenters doing some work at a house located nearby.   However, we were inside the state park and I knew of no houses – other than the ranger houses - within the park.    This knocking sound continued on.   I didn't count the number of ""knocks,"" but I'd say they numbered at least ten knocks and were in a steady rhythm. I stopped walking and looked directly into the wooded, hilly area in the direction the sound seemed to be coming from (towards the south).   The knocking stopped when I stopped walking.   I saw nothing and heard nothing while I was stopped on the road.   There were no odors in the air at this time either.   As mentioned above, there was a light breeze blowing from time to time that morning.  I then proceeded to walk to our cabin which was only about another 75 feet away.   As I began to walk the knocking sound started again and this time I attempted to count the knocks.   There were five or six knocks in a steady rhythm.  Then there were no more. When I got into the driveway of the cabin I again looked in the direction that I thought the sounds came from and saw nothing. Could this sound have come from construction work between the state park and U.S. Highway 45?   Could there have been a utility company crew working in the woods on a power line? I have been in the woods for years as a Scout leader, a camper, and as a hunter, I have heard woodpeckers and other animals make noises before.   This was not a woodpecker.   It was not a deer hitting a tree with his rack.   This was a heavy and deliberate sound.  This knocking sound was unlike any animal sound I have ever encountered. There were no ""whoops,"" ""calls,"" or other noises, just the wood knocking sound.   The knocking was a ""hard"" sound almost like a carpenter hitting a piece of wood repeatedly with a hammer in a steady rhythm.   That's one of the reasons I lean towards it being a sound from a construction site.    However, the fact that the knocking stopped when I stopped walking and looked into the woods, and then resumed when I began walking again, makes me think there are other possibilities as to its origin. After coming home from the state park I listened to wood knocking sounds on the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization website.   The wood knocking sound I heard exactly matches the recorded wood knocking sounds on some of the bigfoot websites.  Again, the sound was similar to hitting two 2x4s together or pounding on a 2x4 with a hammer. During midmorning of that same day we left the state park and went to Meridian for a few hours.    My wife was not feeling well when we returned, so when we got back to the state park we packed our belongings in the car and headed for home.   We had paid for three nights at the park, but we only stayed two nights.  We left the park around 330PM CDT that day.   I didn't hear or see anything out of the ordinary the remainder of the time we were in the state park. The GPS coordinates where I was on the cabin road when I heard these knocking sounds are approximately: N  32 degrees, 5 minutes, 53 seconds     W  88 degrees, 41 minutes, 44 seconds.","Clarkco State Park is located just off US Highway 45 about four miles or so north of Quitman, MS.",Clarke County,Mississippi,Fall,Report 35789: Possible wood knocks heard by a photographer near Quitman,32.09515,-88.68893,10/21/2010,35789,Class B,dj8ytfdxy1,82.36,62.06,41.76,46.09,0.68,0,0.45,0,0,,1016.84,Clear throughout the day.,6,9.78,297,1.21
"I’m always doing outdoor activities, floating, camping, hiking and recently I’ve had some strange encounters.  First, I like to go conservation areas frequently, and at wire road conservation area off of Grisham ford rd. In Crane,  I was there with a friend it was just after sunset when something would throw very large rocks into the Crane creek. that’s all it consisted of is splashing into the creek.  It sounds like  bowling ball sized rocks being thrown into the water making not only a splash but a “ker-plunk” noise.  This really made me and my friend wonder what was making this noise.  We were very open-minded about what could cause this noise and it happened on multiple occasions, all shortly after sunset when no one else was at the conservation area.  We told several people about this and of course everyone would say its probably just ducks, but like I said the objects in the water were very large making a “ker-plunk” noise like a cannon ball. Just as we finally had given up on the search for the cause of the splashing, months had gone by and me and the same friend went on a float trip. It happened to be the forth of July in 2008.   We planned to float in my canoe on Flat creek from Jenkins bridge all the way to a low water bridge on flat creek road (a very long float).  The float started about mid-day and about half way through the float is was very dark and cloudy so no moon light.  It was just pitch dark on the creek and at a slow deep section of the creek we were just quietly floating along not talking when it seemed like we startled something very large about 20ft. Away. It was just standing in the edge of the creek when we startled it, so it stepped out of the creek. You could hear one leg pull out the water followed by one more, and it displaced a lot of water making waves. It made a couple more steps up on land into a very forested area.  Me and my friend were stunned, just remaining dead silent and starring at the area were the noise originated.  Then, a very large rock was thrown within 5ft. Of the boat, exactly like the occurrences in Crane.  Even though we never saw the creature, It was very clear that it was a large bipedal creature because of the very long strides out of the deep water.  It seems that we startled it, so it walked just out of sight not really frightened though, then it threw a rock to warn us to get away.",on flat creek past EE hwy. about 2 miles ,Barry County,Missouri,Summer,Report 25874: Possible late night encounter by canoeists on Flat Creek near Piney Creek Wilderness,36.7279,-93.6383,7/4/2008,25874,Class B,9yt2vnnet2,81.4,72.85,64.3,67.11,0.83,,0.06,0.026,1,rain,,Clear throughout the day.,0,,2,0.48

"I recently told a story of an encounter that happened to me when I was 11 in cortland NY. I am now 30 and live in little river SC. About 2 weeks ago I was walking on highway 17 at about 9:00pm to the nearest store. along the way there is a small creek thats surrounded by wooods that appear to go several miles west of the area. as I approached this section of woods I heard this scattering in the brush. I figured it was a deer or even a wild dog. I went to the store which is about a 5 to 10 minute walk further down the road. as I was walking back which was probably 10 to 15 minutes later the traffic was bothering me so when i approached the same section of woods to get away from the highway I heard an even louder scatter in the bushes about 10 to 20 feet in the woods. I paniced and quickly ran back closer to the edge of the highway. there was no traffic now and I could hear everything clearly. I was too afraid to run so I walked quickly. I could hear this creature stomping through the brush real fast. I would stop for a second to look to see what was following me and it stopped too. I started off agian and I could hear another couple of footsteps that sounded as if it was the size of a bear. I stopped again and it stopped with me. as I approached an area that was partially lit by a company that had an outside light on i could see at the edge of the woods a creature that apeared to be squating down with its long arms in front of it. the hair looked to be about maybe 5 inches long and a light redish color. it looked more ape like than my fist encounter which leads me to believe that it might have been a skunk ape. I still cant say for sure what it was.

"For years our neighbors would tell us that there was a bigfoot that roamed the woods where we lived. We thought that it was a way to keep us from wondering off and finding the illegal plants they may have been growing. The only reason we somewhat believed them was, the grandmother who told us the same thing was a minister at a local church. She is no longer with us. The day i saw what i believe to be a bigfoot was a summer day around 7:45 to 8:30ish. My sister and i was going to visit our friends. She was driving. We travel this route all the time. During the school year the bus travels this route also. The reason i say this is to let you know, im familiar with the area. As we aproached the small brige that crosses a pond that we call a swamp we both noticed it in the middle of the road. At first i thought it was a bear. As she slowed the car and hit the horn; it stood up looked in our direction and took off across the swamp. I have seen many bears, twice too close for comfort. I had one to stand up in front me in my grandmas back yard. I think it was spooked as much as i was. We both ran. It ran away on four legs. So i know what i saw was not a bear. I remember being amazed watching this thing run off.I asked my sister to turn around and go back. She locked the doors and turned around. When we got back there was something in the road that it must have been eating. A rabbit,opossum some type of small animal. Probably road kill. It was dark brown at least 6 to 7 foot tall. It happened so quick, i was not able to get a good look at the face. All i remember was it was big, harry, large back with no neck. I was 16 yaers old at the time, my sister was 18.

"This is not a sighting, but I believe I may have heard some of these creatures near my home last night.  My husband and I recently moved to a remote area of Fairfield County, SC near the Blair community.  The house we are renting has been vacant for quite some time and is near a thickly wooded area; our house backs up to the woods.  We finished moving in last Sunday.  There are no other homes in sight, though there are a few down the road from us.  We drive 23 miles to the nearest town for shopping. Last night (Monday, May 8) my husband and I were half watching TV, half dozing when it occurred to me the sounds I was hearing outside the back window were getting strange.  At first in the back of my mind I thought it was an owl; then I thought it must be the noisiest owl on record.  We are both hard of hearing and had the TV turned up pretty loud and the windows closed.  Then I realized it was more than one, and they were calling to one another, and seemed to be getting closer. I became alarmed around 11PM when one of our two dogs started barking in response to the noise.  They are on our enclosed back porch and we keep the door to the outside open so they can go out to a small enclosed yard area when they need to.  I went out to the porch and turned on the light, and they were very nervous and happy to see me.  After I calmed them down I stayed on the porch and listened in earnest.  What I heard sounded like a rhythmic hoo hoo hoo HOOOOOO, but unlike owl or dove sounds, it was very deep and loud, not at all birdlike.  My husband and I could not identify it, we kept saying ""is that coyote?  wolf?""  and as soon as we would say it we would just shake our heads.  We both grew up and camped, hiked and traveled extensively in the West and know what coyote and wolf sound like. We discerned there were at least three distinct voices fanned out - to the south of our house, directly behind, and to the north, all to the west (wooded) side.  Upon listening at length and discerning a pattern, which seemed to relate to our presence there somehow, I was concerned enough to lock the dogs up on the porch and turn on all the lights to the outside. As the calling continued to move closer, the dogs cowered in the far corner of the porch.  We then realized our indoor cats had been missing all evening.  We found them up in our attic underneath boards we leaned against the wall in preparation for adding shelves there.  When we brought them down they ran right back up there and we didn't see them until morning. Also, the usual night sounds were absent.  Nothing else made a sound while this went on, and it lasted for at least two hours.  Towards the end, another call was so close I nearly panicked, and this one was making rapid hoo HOO noises interspersed with almost talking? sounds, while moving very quickly from the south to the north.  The others were answering rapid-fire.  I can't describe it any better than that, other than to say it wasn't yips or croaking or any of the normal animal sounds we hear out here, but very loud, deep and rapid and most certainly they were communicating with each other.  It was scary and intimidating, and if I had been in a camping situation I would have run for my life. My husband is a rural mail carrier out here and knows everyone.  He talked to several people today and they all said they have heard the sounds before but they don't know what they are either, most think they must be wild dogs. They can't be serious, if they have really listened.  But it doesn't surprise me.  I figure it must be this way with most people when confronted with something unknown and unexplainable, to come up with just about any explanation at hand and dismiss it. I decided to get on the Internet and see if I could find recordings of wild dogs and birds and find something similar.  After a day of searching I found the recordings of wolf and coyote here and the whooping and calls we heard most closely resembled the suspected bigfoot whoops on this site.","[The address provided, but was removed from public posting per request of witness]",Fairfield County,South Carolina,Spring,Report 14611: Possible vocalizations heard by new residents in an unpopulated rural area near the Broad River,34.421,-81.396,5/8/2006,14611,Class B,dnn5gf1hze,62.09,58.41,54.73,52.75,0.86,,0.35,0,0,,,Clear throughout the day.,0,,50,0.17
"I deliver newspapers early in the morning. I was almost finished with the route and I made a left turn on to [edited]  and placed a paper in the tube. I proceeded to the next tube, and after placing the paper in it, my headlights caught something off to the far left. I observed a figure walking along the treeline along the edge of the cornfield away from my position. At first I thought it might be a man, but it was all black and it turned and I saw large red eyes staring back. I could not make out it's face, and it continued to walk away. I turned my vehicle in past the paper tube to try and get a better look. It was at this point it stopped and looked at my direction again. From my estimation it looked to be at least 75 to 100 yards away, and about 6 or 7 feet tall. The creature then continued walking away, and feeling spooked I drove out of there fast.

"I was Hunting for Feral pigs at the Cinnamon Ridge Hunting lodge in Erhardt, SC. We had not seen any hogs the first day so on the second day we hunted in the swamp. On the way over in the morning our guide was telling us about strange noises he had heard back in the area while hunting himself. I love to hunt in the swamps for deer and ducks and have for years. At about 5:30 pm I started hearing several great horned owls calling back and forth in the area behind me which is swamp. My stand was located on a dike between a oak ridge and the water. There was a large gator hole about 100 yrds away. As the owls started calling I heard what sounded like a noise an ape would make but very loud. The ""ooow, ooow"" sound was very quick and repetetive. All the animal noises stopped suddenly and it was very still. The wood ducks and squirrels that we feed took flight in a sudden burst of movement. After the calls none returned and the area was very quiet, even the song birds. I waited until a little before dark and walked out to meet the pick - up vehicle. I have heard several vocalizations similar to this before.

"My co-worker and I were on a turkey farm at about 12:30AM. one night in October,2003. I began smelling a strange smell that I had never smelled before on a birdfarm. I began shining my Q-beam spotlight around in the darkness. I noticed something standing behind the barn across from me. I could see the animal picking up acorns or something off the ground.The animal didn't like my spotlight because it would block the light with its hand. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I ran over to my coworker, that was working on the other feed truck to warn him as to what I had seen. He laughed and said for me to quit tryin to scare him. I told him that I was serious, and he would see it if it was still there, since it was behind the last barn that he had to pump feed in. I noticed he was startled when he shined his spotlight and saw this large creature for himself. He claimed that this creature started walking toward him, and it really shook him up, because he ran to the front of his truck and sped to the front of the farm where I waited on him.

"I was traveling up [road name omitted] about 7am or a little after. I was topping the hill when movement caught my eyes, about 800 to 900 ft. ahead. It was large and dark colored. When I got to the spot it crossed the road, I slowed down some to see if I could see if it was still there. I was still driving so I couldn't just take my eyes completely off the road, (I should have stopped) but as much a I could, I looked up the small hill, there was a massive creature on top of the hill with gray coarse hair about 3 to 4 in. long. Its chest was massive and it had a white spot in its chest about two foot across. I was so in amazement it never even occurred to me to look up. Its chest was about 3 ft. across and on each side of the white there was about 6 to 7 in. of more coarse gray hair, the color of a gray fox or coyote. I went back after work, but did not find tracks or disturbance of any kind. There was an overpowering smell.

"It was approximately 0100 or 0130.  A family member and I had been watching TV in a back room of the house for a few hours. The TV was turned up loudly so my family members could hear easily but by 0100 or 0130 they had fallen asleep so I turned the TV down. I was sitting next to a row of three windows that run along one wall of the room that faces out into the backyard. All of the windows were open and the air was cool. The weather had been nice early summer weather, not too humid and with light rain earlier. I mention there had been light rain earlier because when I heard the sound of something outside the window, although it sounded similar to what car tires sound like driving on wet pavement from far away, it was not.  I heard a fairly long exhalation of breath from just outside the window as if someone was standing outside looking directly in. Since there are bushes planted right in front of the windows, I knew nobody could be standing right in front without crouching down. I was sitting next to the window and the sound sounded like it was from the same level my head was at of between three and four feet. I thought the sound sounded like a living thing but maybe I had been mistaken when, as if one queue, there was another long exhalation just like the first. I immediately stood up in front of the window, looked up (because I was sure that, if I was going to look the thing outside of the window in the face, I would have to look rather high up) and screamed, ""Get out,"" out of the window and went running into the front of the house, still screaming, ""Get out!"" I startled my family member and the dog (who was also in the back room and had remained asleep until I screamed) and they both came running after and caught up with me in the kitchen to find out what was wrong. The following day, I went out into the backyard to look for deer scat thinking I may have heard a deer: there is a holly tree directly to the left of the window I was sitting in front of and heard the sound through and deer have eaten the bottom leaves off the tree. There, literally right up against the corner of the house less than one foot from the wall of the house, as if something had been standing facing the house and leaning against it, was one barefooted human-shaped footprint at least 12"" long and 6"" wide and about an inch or two deep. The print was able to be made, I suppose, because there was dirt mound there from where the bushes are planted, but when I looked for where the left footprint could've been, if something was standing against the corner of the house, I didn't find anything because the dirt was covered with leaves and pinestraw. On the right footprint the odd thing about it was that I couldn't find the little toe: all the other ones were clearly marked. Also, I didn’t realize this until yesterday but the reason that the print may have been deeper on the left side of the print rather than on the right side of the print was that the thing must've been leaning to the left...around the corner of the house to look into the window. I was back visiting the same family member MAY08 and looked to see if any evidence of the footprint existed and nothing did that I could identify. There are many depressions in the soil so I was unable to discern where the footprint depression may have been. My family member had come out to let the dog out to go to the bathroom and had seen the footprint, too, but I told them to go back in the house. We haven’t discussed it with each other because I don’t want to upset or scare them.",[Specific directions removed at the request of the witness],Beaufort County,South Carolina,Spring,Report 24916: Witness hears big exhale and finds clear footprint the next day on property near Bluffton,32.29968,-80.95958,5/30/2007,24916,Class B,djwrtxzp30,84.82,76.61,68.4,63.35,0.73,0.38,0.45,0,0,,1021.44,Foggy in the morning.,9,6.62,128,2.2
"I was fishing Friday from about 8 pm to a little after 9:30 pm on the Savannah river between Lake Hartwell and Lake Russel on the Georgia/SC line. I had walked up the trail by the river from the last parking area to try for some trout or maybe a walleye. It was after 9 pm and dark now. I was about ready to call it a night when I heard distinct footsteps coming towards me. I first thought it might be another fisherman, but the closest one to me was at the first parking area about a half mile away and he was fishing on one of the piers. I thought it was on the trail I had came in on but realized it was up on the side of the hill. I got closer and it stepped on a couple of limbs that cracked from its weight. I thought to myself it had to be another person but why would they be on a hillside in thick woods at night with no light? I broke the thumbsnap on my Sig 45acp just in case it was somebody up to no good. I only had my LED headlamp on and when I shined it at the sound it stopped. I would estimate it was about 25 to 30 yards from me at the time. I could see nothing, no eyes or anything. About a minute after I took the light off of it, it started walking again. I was getting a little concerned by now. I know it wasn’t a deer, as I have spent my whole life in the woods and know what deer sound like when walking. I eased out onto the trail and started walking back to the truck. The footsteps parralelled me back to the parking area but never came out of the woodline. I had Surefire G2 light in the truck and shined it in the woods to see if I could find the source of the sounds. I never did see anything. Nor did I smell anything. I don’t know if it could have been a BF. This area is pretty heavily used and in proximity to a major highway. All I know is the whole thing was very strange because usually a deer or other animals will spook when you put a light on them.","From Anderson, hwy 29 to public access rd leading to fishing area about 3/4 mile east of Hartwell dam.",Anderson County,South Carolina,Spring,Report 19926: Incidents and followup near Lake Hartwell Dam,34.35765,-82.82005,6/1/2007,19926,Class B,dnj57qs7bf,86.95,77.575,68.2,60.52,0.6,0.2,0.52,0,0,,1017.46,Mostly cloudy overnight.,11,9.08,174,1.49

"I travel, every year on vacation, to South Dakota to do some camping in the Black Hills and have for the past three years camped in the same location. I belong to a club of outdoor enthusiasts, we travel to certain locations to scratch a living from the earth for a few days and once you have the fever there's no such thing as a nonworking vacation. This last trip (June 2008) I had an experience I couldn't explain: I was asleep in my tent; I was the only person left in camp everyone else had packed up and left. I wasn't too concerned as I have camped by myself in this area several times and could only recall one other time when I felt like something was nearby perhaps a cougar or other predator type animal as the crickets stopped chirping and the whole area became extremely quiet. This particular night I was sleeping soundly and was then suddenly awake and aware that something was up, everthing was silent. I didn't know what had woken me at first but I reached over and checked my watch seeing that it was 3:11am I thought to myself I need to get back to sleep, then I heard it; someone or something was moving around in the stream below my camp. Not directly below, but more to the north and west of my camp following the curvature of the stream. Picture a curving ""L"" shape. Now rotate the ""L"" 1/4 turn to the right, apply that to moving stream water, my camp sits above the water 20 to 30 feet in the inside turn of the ""L"". I heard splashing in the stream and then, SMACK....SMACK. There was a pause of a few seconds then SMACK....SMACK....SMACK. It was two rocks being hit together in a pattern. Ok, creepy and not what I was expecting, I reached over and put a shell in the chamber of my weapon and checked the safety. I'll give it a few minutes and if nothing else happens I'll go back to sleep. Nothing else did happen except when the sun came up I packed up and left. The area around the stream is covered in rocks of every size and shape from small pebbles to boulders as big as cars and trucks. I didn't think to look for tracks. I was still the only one there and I didn't know what to think, except that if someone thought it was fun to show up at a secluded camp at that time of night to smack rocks together there must be something wrong with them and it's time to vacate the area.

"Hello, what I'm going to descibe is real and nothing less.  My friend told me about this web site. I'm going to tell you my story to the tee ! Saturday the 21 of 07, two friends of mine went to the coastal region of S.C. on a relic hunt involving metal detectors in search of civil war relics. I met them at a boat landing on the Ashepoo river to unload the boat for a 30 min boat ride in alligator infested water. Ariving at or destination we tied up the boat to a tree on the bank of the river. I've hunted  here in the past during winter and encountered large boar. It was very hard getting into the clearing because there is a narrow track of land with a 1700's slave dug dike on the right and on the left is a swamp that used to be probably rice or cotton feilds. We got into the opening if you want to call it that compared what we went through to get there. We had two way radios set them up to the right channel so we could stay in touch in case of getting lost. Well after hunting for about 2 hours I heard a boar grunt which Im very familiar with from hunting in remote places , I ignored it and kept hunting. A few min later I meet up with one of my partners and I asked him where Pete was so he got on the radio. Pete replied he was left of our posisioun about a mile.  He went looking for new spots to hunt, I looked at Dennis and decided to take a 5 min break because of the intense heat, but sitting still we were swarmed with skeeters. Dennis went to check out some large oaks on a hill. So I went right in some pines were the slave cabins were, about ten minites later I heard a loud "" WOOP"". I took my head phones off and ducked thinking first instinct that some one else was out there, but again I heard it load as day ""WOOP"" , it was definately- repeat- definately ape sounding. Then I heard a large stick hit a tree three times about 100 yards away. Then about 15 to 20 seconds later I heard it again hittng another tree. This time it was further off towards the river. Before I heard anything I smelled a foul stench in the breeze but thats not concrete evidence because of the dead boar I found in the past.  I do believe in bigfoot and was happy this happend to me. I was not scared one bit but did get goose bumps. I could see someone's mind play tricks on them if they were actually out looking for them but I was concentrating on finding relics. I just cant fully desribe the sound it was so deep and DEFINATELY APE. I hope yall take full instrest in this as much as I do.

"I was traveling down Highway 61 between Canady and Givehans headed East at ten minutes after eight in the morning. I saw what I perceived as a man walking up to the side of the road. The sun was up high enough that I had put the visor back into normal position, but it back lit the man so all I could see was a silhouette. I assumed it was a man going to cross the road to a mail box. He was far enough ahead that I did not take my foot of the gas peddle, but watched him cross the road. As I approached I was concerned he may step back into the road without looking so I let off the gas and looked for him. He was gone! There was no mail box, no man, not even a house. Both sides of the road were thick woods. I slowed way down to look for him but I could not find hide nor hair of any one. He was no where to be found. Now I began thinking about what I had really seen. He had walked up to the road from the right in a leisurely manner, what I call a mosie. When he stepped into the road his first stride put him in the center of my lane. His second step put him at the center line. He crossed the road in four steps and at no time during this did the sun show between his legs above the knee. This was a big man. His hands had swung in front and behind his body as he walked. There was nothing in his hands. A hunter would have had a gun or a bow with him. I could see no color distinction between any parts of his body. Why would a man be crossing the road from one patch of wood to another at 8:10 AM? A really big man. I went on to where I was headed but noted a few land marks so I could find the place again that afternoon on my return trip. Which I did. I stopped and walked up and down that spot in the road. I crossed the road in ten steps or six hard strides, but I did not find any thing to tell me what I seen that morning.","Hwy 61 about half way between Canady and Givehans, near Edisto River.",Colleton County,South Carolina,Spring,"Report 25915: Motorist describes possible daylight morning sight near Edisto River, between Canady and Givehans",33.04536,-80.45451,5/2/2009,25915,Class B,djygcpwz4j,86.36,76.08,65.8,62.47,0.67,0.26,0.28,0,0,,1017.02,Partly cloudy starting in the afternoon.,7,9.96,199,3.66
"I was on my home from work in Bishopville, traveling on Hwy. 15 at approximately 2:10am.

I made the left turn on hwy 15 to 15 north and I drove about 3 miles when I noticed a large shape on the other lane ahead of my car about 100 yards, I assumed that it was another deer so I slowed my car down to about 30 to 40 mph to allow time for the animal to cross over. as I approached nearer to this shape I noticed that it was human like because it was standing erect on 2 legs and it had arms like a man however, when I got within 40 ft of this creature I realized that it wasn't a bear or a deer and that it appeared to be very tall. I floored it... I was very afraid, I didn't know what to expect, but I knew that I was safer than a sitting duck.

"Observed a giant bi-pedal creature in the Cherokee National Forest in Unicoi County Tennessee near the North Carolina border. Creature was in the creek when I first saw it. The creature immediately sensed my presence and came out of the creek and placed its hand on a tree and hit the tree in a knocking manner approximately 4 times. I was trying to get my phone out and attempt to take a picture when the creature stomped the ground with its foot and growled something incredibly fierce several times. A growl I can best describe as a mix between a bear and a large canine. After the growl I started to retreat and as I did the creature took off in a run and vanished. I was in the very close range of 15 to 20 yards when I observed it. If there had not been running water I don't believe I would have gotten that close to it as it masked it hearing me and me hearing it. The time of day was 7 am and I was in the woods going to go trout fishing. I watched the creature for around 45 seconds and height estimate is at least 8feet and shoulder to shoulder 3 feet at least.

"My husband and i were staying in a mountain cabin in the Pigeon Forge area of Tennessee this past week, and heard what we believe was the ""call"" of a sasquatch.  it was around 8:30-9:00 pm (EDT) on Tuesday, April 11, 2006.  we were sitting on the back porch relaxing, and enjoying the quietitude of the evening.  the air was somewhat smokey, although clearing, as there had been some sort of fire/brush burn-off on another, near-by mountain, and the wind was blowing the smoke in our direction (mild breeze to the SSE).  it was not quite totally dark yet, but was past ""dusk"", and the moon was visible, though hazy, in sky.  the frogs were croaking, the birds were quiet, the squirrels were down for the night....no vehicles or people within earshot, we seemed to be the only cabin inhabited at that time---the weekenders had left, and no one had arrived to take their places yet.  anyway, all of a sudden, we heard this sound that i can only explain as a cross between a howl and a yell.  it was a vocalization without any real structure (no ""words"" or progression of sounds that could be construed as any sort of ""language"").  it was definitely a mammal, and just as definitely not any canine, feline, bear, raccoon, or any other sort of animal one would expect to hear in the woods.  also obviously not any sort of livestock.  the sound seemed like it must have come from an animal at least man-sized/bear-sized, and sounded like an animal ""calling"", rather than making a warning sound or an identifying sound.  it carried what seemed to be a long way--sounded as if it came from the SSE, at least from the other side of the mountain next to us......would place it in the mountainy areas just west of Pigeon Forge, around the Walden's Creek area.  the calling went on for 2-3 minutes.  it was a long, drawn-out sound, both nasal and ""from the chest"" (don't know how to describe that).  if a human made the sound, it would definitely have to be a male, as it was too deep for a female human to do.  it would also have to be a person with a great deal of lung capacity, as each call went on for 10-15 seconds, and as noted before, came from a distance of at least a couple of miles.  the sound itself, best as i can describe would be vocalized thusly:  ""hhhnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnuh"".  and would go from a higher (baritone) note down to a deeper note at the end.  anyway, this went on for a few minutes, then all was quiet again (except for the ""normal"" woodsy noises).  there was no other recurrance that night or any other night that we heard, and we never saw anything.  we did, however hear some other noises which may or may not apply---a short time after the calls (15 minutes, or so), we heard what sounded like something either throwing or pushing some VERY large rocks onto other rocks (heard rocks crashing onto each other).  This came from the same general direction, although seemed closer to us (on ""our"" side of the mountain).  This went on for a good 10 minutes, or so, then things got quiet again, and stayed quiet for the rest of the night.  The next night, there were some sounds like large fallen trees were ""thumping"" around in the woods, but there were other people in the area by then, too, so that could have been some idiots trying to go hiking at night and/or fooling around in the woods. FYI:  my husband and i both have a good deal of knowledge of the sorts of wildlife found in the woods and mountains, as we both spent much of our childhoods in such places, and learned first-hand the calls and vocalizations of such animals.  this did not sound like anything either of has heard---including anything i've heard on any wildlife show on tv.  ; )  it did, however, sound a lot like some of the purported sasquatch/bigfoot vocalizations i've heard on some websites i've checked out.","Can only say that it was in the Bluff Mountain area between Townsend and Pigeon Forge, as sounds are difficult to pinpoint.",Sevier County,Tennessee,Spring,Report 14383: Possible vocalizations heard near Pigeon Forge,35.46865,-83.3626,4/11/2006,14383,Class B,dnk9z0c5ye,75.18,61.245,47.31,33.55,0.42,0,0.44,0,0,,,Clear throughout the day.,9,9.41,208,0.94
It was about 10:30 at night.  We were driving down a road to go to out cabin in the forest and we saw a large (about 6 or 7 feet.) ape like creature walking down the hill in front of out car. We (Me my mom dad and brother.) all sat there in out seats in awe then drove away quickly.We had been there the last night  at about 12:30 at night I had been asleep and my parents saw the creature for the first time and said it was probably a bear and drove off. But after we saw it the second time we knew it was no bear. We came back the next morning after the second sighting and we met another family that said they had seen the same thing about the same time. They said it came within five feet of their car.

"On Sunday night July 15 (about midnight) I walked out of my garage and I smelled something musky, like a buck in rut or wet dog and I commented to my father about that, but just shrugged it off. It was overcast that night. On that particular night, across the road at another neighbors house, I could hear dogs barking, figured they were barking at coyotes or deer, at about the same time I could smell that musky smell. On July 16th, I walked out of my garage to leave for work at about 7:30 am, when I noticed that one of the trees in my yard had a limb that was hanging down. I did not think anything of it at the time, except that I thought it was weird, since on the day before, there were no storms, heavy wind and the limb was fine, because I had mowed around the tree on the afternoon of July 15. I returned home from work at 5 pm, changed clothes and decided to go look at the limb. I noticed that the limb was not broken in two, like someone had hung on it, but twisted so that is split. I took some clippers and cut it off.  The more I thought about it, the more I was puzzled, so I decided to go out to the burn pile that I had laid it on, and cut the twist out of the limb and take it inside to study closer. Showing my father, we both were puzzled. The limb looked like if you took a rope and twisted it, and the middle of the rope separates. Enclosed are some photos that I took of the area, the limb and tree, along with an aerial photo showing where the tree is located and the layout of the land. I did search for footprints and any other evidence, but there were none to be found. I will also be getting the twist checked out, I only wish I would have kept it together and on the tree to begin with, since it would have been easier to study. Lesson learned this time.

"This particular incident happened to me about 3 years ago. An event that I had kept to myself for at least a year before I even told any of my closest friends about. Like the majority of people who have an experience like this, the fear of being ridiculed and labeled ""nuts"" has kept me quiet. Stumbling upon your website and reading other reports prompted me to give my account. Being from the South I have always been active outdoors; fishing, hunting,camping and spelunking. I was on a solo camping trip on the Cumberland Plateau. It was early morning, very dark and my campfire had long been extinguished and my propane lantern was spent. I was asleep in my 2 man tent when I suddenly awoke to the feeling that someone was approaching me. I had strategically set my tent up so that I could see the end of the 40 yard, steep incline that led to my campsite. Sitting up I saw the silouette of a humanoid figure at the top of the trail.(The closet comparison I can make would be similar to the alien in Predator.) I strained hard to make sure I was relly seeing what my eyes were telling me I was seeing. The figure had apparently stumbled upon me by chance and stopped. As I was looking, I first noticed the height to be 6 1/2 to 7 foot tall, bi-pedal and shoulders that were the widest I had ever seen. It was then that I saw a second figure of equal proportions directly behind the first. At this point, the second figure moved left as if to outflank my tent. That is when the sudden rush for urgency swept over me. I quickly started feeling around for the .44 Magnum and flashlight that I had in the tent with me. What seemed like forever but only took 3-5 seconds, I located both and shined/aimed it in the direction of the trail and it was gone. I stayed in the tent and replayed the events that just happened over and over becoming more and more convinced that what I saw were actually 2 Bigfoot creatures. The size, stealth and intelligence of these creatures was humbling. There are black bear that inhabit the woods also, but being familiar with the species and the fact that the two figures stood bi-pedally still and silent for an extended period of time and the intelligence to outflank me solidifies my belief in this encounter. I eventually went back to sleep with the thought that I was no longer in danger and that I had probably startled them as much as they did me. I left the area that morning knowing I had experienced something unlike any other experience in the wild that I had ever had.","Off of Hwy 27 North, turn left into the Laurel-Snow Wilderness Pocket.",Rhea County,Tennessee,Spring,Report 20231: Camper Awakens and Sees Two Creatures in the Laurel Snow Pocket Wilderness,35.5467,-85.02585,3/1/2004,20231,Class B,dn7d1pn4d1,66.43,59.99,53.55,45.01,0.64,0.73,0.33,0.0008,0.36,rain,1019.31,Overcast throughout the day.,4,9.71,186,4.7
"I am an avid outdoors man, I canoe and camp on a regular basis, mostly by myself (nobody spends any time in the wild anymore). On my most recent canoe/camping trip I had set up camp started a fire, and and had just finished my dinner at around 9p.m. I had put my drinks in the water on the edge of the river and was walking down to the edge of the river to grab on, when in about ten yards of the edge I heard a big splash, something being thrown or dropped in the water, I didn't pay any attention so I kept walking, then as I approached the edge another even bigger splash was made and I could see the large rock that made it fly through the air hitting about ten yards from where I was. I froze and all the hair on my body stood straight up. I shined my led light over to the area and saw a set of eyes for about two seconds before they vanished. I fired my pistol to scare off anyone I thought would be messing with me, but no response, and this was on a week night where the possibility of someone roaming the area was not likely. I quickly packed my gear and left for home.

"Earlier this year i was camping by myself in the Citico Creek area. Around Ten oclock P.M. i was in my hammock (i dont use a tent,i go lightweight)when i heard something,i guess you could say running down a steep hill across the trail from me.At first i thought it was a deer or some other animal but it stopped and started moving parallel with the trail. So i get up and get my fire going again to try and spook what ever it was off. Whatever was moving (ill just say IT from now on)went down about fifty yards and crossed the trail over to my side.

"myself along with my two best friends went down to see some family in tennessee during the summer for a few days. while down there we usually take some time to do some small game hunting. on our second to last day there we went back for about a mile or two to try and find the property line since the man who owned the land was in poor health and couldnt do it himself. he hadnt been able to go back that far since about 15 years do to his condition. we noticed the deeper we went into the woods we saw no animals and that was interesting to us. later that night we were at a small pond with a bonfire when one of my friends decided he needed to go back to the house. we had heard something pacing back and forth on a hill behind us, but we figured it was probably just a coyote or fox so we didnt pay it too much attention. he had a remington 870 shotgun with 6 shells of buck shot loaded anyways for the half mile walk back to the house by himself, on the front of which he had mounted a flashlight. about two minuites after he left we heard him fire all six shots in rapid succession. once we got to him he was scared stiff. all he could say was that something was staring down at him and show us how far apart its eyes were. we didnt stick around long thinking that he may have just injured a bear so we ran back to the house. once we got there he told us that he turned a corner to see the eyes staring down at him just off the path.. he yeld at the animal twice and it didnt move, so he shot. the animal was about 10 feet away and still managed to run off. well he went to sleep in the house and his brother and i went to go bed down outside in the barn loft. i had just laid down in my sleeping bag when i heard the most terrifying scream i have ever heard to this day. this animal screamed for a solid 20 to 30 seconds on one breath. i could tell that it was coming from the area we had just been however it was so loud even still i get chills thinking about it. it only let out one scream and then stopped. but as soon as it did, the entire forest fell silent. the only sound heard was the horse that had been spooked running around its stable. i didnt get much sleep that night. the next morning we had to leave so we didnt have much time to investigate the spot in the daylight. however we did confirm the spot where he saw the animal with a steep incline about 15 feet off the trail. i found no shot impacts from the shotgun even searching the ground leading us all to believe that the animal had been shot. since it had rained the night before the ground was still wet and i couldnt find but maybe one spot of blood. we tried to track it but we didnt have time and the woods were so thick that it was difficult to find any prints. there was only one deep indent which may have been a print but we couldnt tell. all i know is that the animal was big and still ran off after being hit 6 times with buckshot from 10 feet away and still had enough air in its lungs to scream as loud as it did for that long. i know a lot about animals and the only thing that i know of that could be that big would be a bear, but even a healthy uninjured bear doesnt make the sound this animal did. so i dont know what it was for sure but the only thing that makes since is bigfoot.",i dont know how to get there or any of the roads in the area.,Fentress County,Tennessee,Summer,Report 26829: Camper (active duty Marine from Cmp.

Our little community is surrounded on almost three sides by a state forest and the Catoosa Wildlife Refuge.  We have an over abundance of ""protected"" wildlife of all kinds (including too many deer, in my opinion) that venture, at will, into our community.  Always the bold tomboy, I preferred to get my exercise by hiking the heavily forested back roads and trails near our home instead of playing golf as my husband did.  I never hiked more than 6 miles from home, and always in the early morning.  One morning, I was approximately 4 miles from my home when I came upon an unexpected sunny clearing that seemed to have been an old road or path at one time because it was grassy and void of underbrush or trees.  On my hikes I am normally under a full canopy of very tall trees.  So the sunlight was an unexpected pleasure.  As I rounded a curve and my eyes caught the filtered sunlight from the clearing, I observed a large ape-like creature jump from the woods and pounce at something on the ground.  I abruptly froze.  In a flash, the creature stood back up holding a long snake by the head.  Just as quick as this happened, the creature disappeared back into the cover of the woods alongside the clearing.  I remained still for a moment contemplating whether the animal had seen me and how best to protect myself.  I literally heard my heart beating.  I quickly ruled out tree climbing and decided the only alternative was to turn in the opposite direction and run as fast as my legs would carry me. I ran nearly all the way home.  I was so disturbed by what I had seen, I decided that no one would believe it, so I never told anyone.  That was about 5 or 6 years ago, and my husband has since died. Over the years, I have tried to convince myself that I really didn't see the thing that has so frightened me that morning in the woods.  I tried to convince myself that I had somehow imagined it; however, the vivid memory persists.  To this day, I have never set foot in any woods again, essentially breaking a very longstanding and much revered habit that day.  I am still fearful of seeing that creature again.  I have always been a sober-minded individual, not at all given to making up fantasies or stretching the truth as I know it.  I was completely caught off guard and stunned the other day when an ad spot for your show came across my TV screen. After watching your show, I am now convinced that I actually did see what I thought I saw that day on my last hike. Your show also brought to mind the night a few years ago.  This happened well after my experience in the woods.  My husband and I were sitting on our deck looking up at the stars, so clearly visible up here on a clear night in the dark woods of the Cumberland Plateau.  We were quietly listening for the Whipoorwill who nests every year in the woods across our street.  He calls relentlessly for a mate every night during season.  Piercing through the peace and tranquility we heard the most horrific deep bellowing scream from what seemed like some distance away.  We had both been leaning way back in our lawn chairs admiring the night sky, and almost fell out of our chairs in shock.  I remember my husband abruptly stood up and said we should go inside and he added that he had never seen a mountain lion big enough to scream like that.  I did not make the mental connection to the scream we heard and the creature I had seen a few years prior until I saw your show and heard your team members calling out to bigfoot.  Oh my gosh!  That was the same sound!  I must confess that I am a reluctant convert!","It was within a few miles of the community stables and Dorcester Golf Course, roughly between Fairfield Glade (Peavine Rd), I-40, and the village of Crab Orchard, but beyond the FFG subdivisions.",Cumberland County,Tennessee,Summer,Report 31005: Early morning walker witnesses a sasquatch pouncing on a snake east of Crossville,35.97231,-84.88466,6/1/2005,31005,Class A,dn7sskscuh,68.05,62.92,57.79,59.29,0.86,0.79,0.83,0.0119,1,rain,1012.4,Rain in the morning and evening.,5,6.6,95,6.27
"This happened on my grandparent's farm, which they still live on and I still visit almost weekly. I was probably 12 at the time and it was the summer so my grandparents would allow my sister (10 at the time) and I to have sleepovers at their house. There were probably 7 of us staying over that night and we had been outside all day and were all from the area. For a little background on the location of the sighting my grandparents house is situated between two small towns with populations of around 1000 each. The farm is also about 10 minutes from 3 different wildlife areas. They had no neighbors at the time other than cows and corn. Now they have one neighbor whose house you can see from the yard but no other visible neighbors. Around 11pm we decided to go outside because we were being loud and my grandparents had gone to bed. We had done this probably a half dozen of times over the summer. We had been outside for probably 30 minutes to an hour when we started to hear odd noises in the cornfield across the road and the sound of corn stalks breaking. This continued over the next probably 20-30 minutes. As a bunch of 10-12 year old girls we ignored the sounds and kept talking all the while my grandparents 3 dogs were sitting in front of us tails tucked growling like something was in the cornfield that was maybe 50 yards from where we were sitting in my grandparents front yard. We heard a loud scream from the cornfield as something came out of the field right in front of us. What came out of the field was a tall humanoid creature covered in dark brown hair that was slightly taller than the corn was at the time at about 6-7 feet. We all looked at the creature and took off running back towards the house leaving all of our things outside. Once we got inside we looked at each other in utter shock at what we had seen. None of us wanted to say anything to my grandparent because we all thought they would call us crazy. Of the seven of us that saw the creatures 4 of us had been raised hunting and fishing. We knew the animals native to the area and spent hours in the woods in with our fathers and grandfathers learning how to track animals and respect nature. To this day I am afraid to be outside at their house at night by myself.

"It was unusually warm to be mid-December on this day and me and my buddy was hunting in a area known as Chilhowee. It was about a hour before sunset when we climbed out of our deer stands. I met my buddy in a little holler about 100 yards from both of our tree stands. We were walking back to the 4 wheeler when we heard a very low rumble in the holler we had just met in. We were now at this time about 35 yards from the holler almost in a field, so we thought we would be real still and sit on the edge of the field for a minute and see if we could hear anything else. At this time we were thinking it was just a grunt or a blow from a deer that we had scared. We wated probally 10 minutes before we heard a loud splash in a little drinking hole, me and my buddy looked at each other and said what the hell is that. So we wated another minute, still hoping that a deer would come out then we heard a second splash. At this time we realized it wasn’t a deer. so we walked probally 20 yards and saw what we believe is a bigfoot. It was aproximately 7 to 8 feet tall and I would say weighed 300-350 pounds just guessing.  Me and my friend were almost in shock at what we had scene. The bigfoot saw us and actually didn’t seem to care that we were watching it.  He kind of just lingered around the area for another minute before walking over a small ridge where we lost sight of it and to be honest we were to scared to go and look for it so we went back to the house and told everybody there, but they said we were crazy and it was just a bear. I have been hunting bear for years and I am familiar with their movements.  This was no bear.  I know this because it never dropped down on all four of its feet the whole time we watched it and we probally saw it walk a total of only 30-40 yards but I am 100 % sure it was no bear.

"Let me first start by saying that when I opened my new issue of Texas Fish and Game, it opened right to the page with the picture of the ""creature"" on it, and the hairs stood on my head.  The image of the creature in the background is right on the money for what I saw. At the time, I was probably around 13 - 14 years of age (I'm now 37), and I've never had the opportunity to ""officially"" tell anyone about this until now.  Only my family and close friends have heard this, and everytime I tell it, my eyes water, and the hairs on my head stand on end (I can't explain this reaction).  Back then, we were in the process of clearing @ 40 acres of bottom land for farming. I was in the woods alone, operating a Model R John Deere, with an offset plow. I was making a turn under a tree, when a limb got hung on the stack of the tractor.  When freed from the stack the limb came towards the rear of the tractor, where I was already on the floorboard, so instead of catching me, and throwing me off the seat into the plow, caught the throttle (mounted on the steering column), killing the engine, and putting a nice bend in the steering wheel. Don't know how much you know about a Model R, but it has a smaller motor (pony motor), which starts the larger motor. I was never succesful in starting the larger motor with the pony motor. I was in the ""bottom"" of this 40 acre bottom, and to my left was a dirt road, and some cows inside a fence. To my right was the majority of the acreage, and a fence about 175 - 200 yards away. It was on the fence line 175 - 200 yards away, where I saw a large dark figure (standing on two legs), and appeared to be trying to get a better look at me, by leaning one way then the other.  I actually saw the arm move a branch. It was partially blocked by foliage along the fenceline, and I could not make out any facial features. After us getting a better look at each other, I had seen enough and sprung from the tractor, running as fast as I can (which is not easy to do in freshly plowed ground). I realized the tractor was probably my best chance out of there, so I ran back, pulled the pin from the clevis, and started pulling furiously on the starter for the pony motor which started.  I released the compression on the larger engine with one lever, and then engaged the pony motor to the larger engine with another lever, and for the first time, successfully started that tractor on my own. While beating a hasty retreat, I looked back along the fenceline, but could not see ""it"" anymore.",,Wharton County,Texas,Summer,Report 9315: Boy sees a bigfoot while clearing land,29.38333,-96.25,4/29/2002,9315,Class A,9v5x1v0fk3,91.69,,,73.18,0.81,,0.6,,,rain,,Humid throughout the day.,0,,172,9.34

"Mike Hall and I had just wrapped up night operations with TBRC/BFRO on that Saturday night, we hiked out of our area and met with Daryl Colyer, Alton Higgins and other members of the group at the forest service road where we had parked Mike's Jeep. We loaded our gear in the back and headed back to base camp as the others left to go back into the woods to do some further research. Interested in getting back to base camp and getting warm, and much needed sleep, I was concentrating on watching for animals in the roadway, as I didn't want us to hit something and be stuck out there in the cold. Mike was driving and there was no conversation until we topped a hill in the road, and I saw something moving in the same direction that we were in the middle of the road. I pointed and asked ""what is that?"". Mike slowed and asked ""what is what?"" and I answered ""that thing in the road just beyond the headlights."" Mike looked and said ""holy s---!"" and I said ""whatever it is don't hit it."" What we saw was a large dark upright moving creature walk in the middle of the road. It was about 5 1/2 to 6 feet tall, moving upright, in the same direction that we were traveling. It had noticeable hair and its head seemed domed and no neck, as if its head rested right on its shoulders. It was very very broad at the shoulders and thick (massive). It never turned to look at us, so I don't know what the face looked like. We have no recollection of its hands or lower body, our focus was on how wide it was and how smooth that it moved. It was amazing, just very graceful. No jerky movements, very fluid in its movement. As we neared, it moved to the side of the road in a smooth motion then stepped off into the ditch and into the woods to the right side of the road. Then Mike realizing what we were witnessing, stopped the jeep and grabbed the gun and flashlight and jumped out to look for tracks. I stayed in the jeep not believing what I was seeing with it running. As mike scanned the woods following sounds he was hearing, he motioned for me to cut the engine and waved for me to get out an join him. I did both reluctantly. As I got near Mike he asked for me to look where he was shining his flashlight and to tell him what I saw, to my utter disbelief I saw a large shape of head and shoulders move quickly between two trees and disappear. I must have blinked because it was there one second and gone the next. We scanned the woods and the road for any signs but couldn't see anything, we also listened for movement but it was dead quiet. We then moved back into the jeep and just sat there, amazed at what we had just witnessed. There was no odor and no sound, other that what Mike had heard before I got out of the jeep. In reflection on the event I did have the feeling that we were being watched. Mike was so excited over this he could hardly think, so I grabbed a pad and pen and said to him, ""Here let's write down what we saw."" He was so shaken that he couldn't even write, so I took over and had him dictate what he saw and added what I saw. Not having any way to communicate with the others in the woods, we didn't know what to do. Not thinking clearly because of the excitement and lack of sleep we drove back to base camp, where we were headed in the 1st place. Upon reaching camp, I just couldn't face another cold night on the ground and begged Mike to take me into town to a nice warm hotel. The next day we returned and reported the incident to Daryl Colyer and the rest of the group.","Near Lake Conroe, several creeks in area that we were scouting around.",Walker County,Texas,Winter,Report 10407: Journalist and investigator have early morning sighting in Sam Houston National Forest,30.6,-95.63,1/28/2005,10407,Class A,9v7ypfs3gm,48.86,47.005,45.15,43.64,0.93,1,0.6,0.0177,1,rain,1019.9,Rain in the morning.,3,8.81,11,3.33
"I was sitting out on the porch around 10 pm on Tuesday night, August 31st. My dogs (a lab mix and a pit bull) started acting strange and growling. I heard something over to the right of our house. It was very dark over there because we have no light over there. It sounded like something heavy stepped on a piece of tin that is over there on the ground. I could not see anything because it was so dark. That's when I decided that it must be someone over there because it sounded like a heavy person had stepped on the tin. I ran into the house to get my husband. I told him that there must be someone outside. My husband got his pistol and came outside. As my husband was coming out the door, our pit bull ran inside the house very scared. Our lab mix kept staring over to the left side of the house where we have a light and my husband's trailer. We stood there on the porch for a little bit when suddenly this grayish animal that looked like an overgrown monkey jumped up on the corner of a refrigerator that was lying on the tail end of my husband's trailer just outside our chain link fence. It was stooped over and very fast. As soon as it jumped up on the fridge, it jumped off and tumped the trailer back off its blocks and made a loud banging noise. It scared us to death. My husband fired his pistol toward the ground just as it started to run off very fast. It ran off like it was going out across the road toward the lake that is across the road from us. It was on two legs and stooped over. It was grayish and had a manlike face, but its nose was flatter than a human nose. Its face had no hair. It was about 5 ft tall and was covered with gray hair.

" It has been a very long time but I just can't seem to forget that day. Let me start by saying that I knew the area fairly well - I used the riding trails as relaxation for my horse. I would ride in the area at least once a week for a couple of years. I knew the different trails and the animals and birds that usually occupied the area. I had been riding for approximately 30 minutes when we came upon a ridge - my horse began to walk very cautiously almost as if he was getting nervous. He didn't make a sound but you could tell he felt uncomfortable. His ears were pointing towards the front and he was watching the ridge very closely. I noticed that it was completely silent which was strange for the area. Usually the mockingbirds and scissortails would follow you from tree to tree but not this day in this area. We came up to the top of the ridge and began walking down a narrow trail when my horse began to shake. I remember like it was yesterday that I began to feel like I was being watched and became a little scared myself. Then my horse jumped to the right, I looked over to the left expecting to see a rattlesnake and squatting in a large brush (a group of bushes - not just one bush) was something large - it was very dark and scared me to death! My horse took off running. I couldn't hold him back at all - he was scared, very scared. I remember looking back and seeing something come out of the brush but I never could tell height or weight because of the winding trail. You could definitely make out that it was covered with hair, I say that because I didn't see any clothing and it was covered - no skin was showing. We came upon an area with a small clearing and I forced my horse to stop - I looked back to see if anything was following us and I saw nothing. Regardless my horse wanted out of there and began pawing at the ground. He wanted out of the area. We made it back to the horse trailer in just a minute or two. My parents were there and saw the fear in my face and how scared my horse was. I told them what happened and they never questioned me - I was pale white and the horse was ready to leave - he never acted like that. I think they thought it was a person hiding out and didn't ask anything else. I would never go back to ride in the area again. I don't know if it was a transient or what but I can't imagine someone just hanging out there. Especially in the brush - I am not sure what kind of brush it was but it was the kind that would cut you to pieces. The area was mainly motorcycle/horse trails but very few people used them. The area was not far from the lake and there was ranchland to the north. The day was hot with a gusty breeze - I remember that because I was wearing a t-shirt and shorts. I know it was fall because I was back in school. I know the ecology doesn't seem to fit the habitat of a bigfoot but I just can't figure out what it was. It wasn't a black bear or big cat because it was coming out of the brush in a upright position not on all fours. You could tell it was going to stand up - thankfully my horse was scared enough I never had to see the actual height. There were some berries in the area and plenty of rodents so that might be able to sustain a large animal for a short time - perhaps he/she was just moving through the area. The area is now a state park and the particular place I had the encounter is no longer accessible, and even if it was, I would not go back to even try to find the spot.  It is not a remote location anymore due to urban sprawl. At the time there were very few homes in the area to the north - it was primarily cattle and sheep ranches.","The location is not accessible anymore (or at least I don't think it is).  The location and the surrounding area is now a state park.  I remember it was close to a spillway, an area known as Red Arroyo.  The exact location is to about 100 yards northwest of the spillway on a ridge.  The road that led to the location has been dug up and vegetation has covered what was once a paved road.

"I was driving eastbound on I-10 near Sonora, Texas at 1:00 AM watching out intently for mule deer, which were everywhere, grazing beside the freeway and running across the road. What I at first assumed to be a tree, saguaro, or bush appeared in my headlights in the center median at mile marker 406 approximately 5 yards off the pavement.  As I passed, I noticed the subject was turning in synchrony with my motion, displaying the same right side of his body to my view, until we were parallel to one another. Other reports indicate subjects shielding their eyes from bright lights at night, but this guy was simply rotating his body with no other obvious motion. Just as the headlights were fading on the subject, the subject turned directly to face my vehicle and began to move.  In that instant, I realized how incredibly wide the shoulders were, and how much the body tapered down to the feet, and observed two very long arms.  Immediately upon passing the subject, I was still watching in my rear view mirrors with the subject illuminated by the headlights from a truck perhaps 1/4 mile behind me, as it ran across the road in a southerly direction, leaning forward, arms pumping almost parallel to the ground, knees bent at all times. I noted the mile marker, reversed course, and returned to the site looking for a tree or a bush that could explain the sight, circling several times for about 30 minutes, but found nothing but grass in the median. The subject was perhaps seven feet tall, all dark brown in color, perhaps 3 inch long hair overall, very wide shoulders, and long arms, the fingertips about parallel with the tops of the knees.  No other details were evident in the short sighting period.","Eastbound on Interstate 10, in the median strip 100 yards east of Mile Marker 406.",Sutton County,Texas,Summer,Report 15334: Possible late night highway sighting on I-10 near Sonora,30.566,-100.545,7/19/2006,15334,Class B,9v2tbh37ge,98.11,84.625,71.14,57.75,0.42,0.08,0.82,,,rain,,Partly cloudy in the afternoon.,10,9.87,120,4.27
"Reported on behalf of a friend who wishes to remain anonymous. While fishing from a small boat close to shore on the Texas side of Toledo Bend, D.R. noticed a strong, musky/fecal odor for several minutes before actually seeing anything. The shore sloped gently up from the water, and was covered with short grass. This offered an unobstructed view to the trees which began growing approximately 20 yards up from the bank. These trees were short (approximately 5-10 feet), and spread far apart. D.R. cast his line into the shallower water toward the bank and that is when he noticed what he thought was someone watching them from the treeline. He also noticed that the creature was attempting to hide behind one of the short trees. It was very still, and did not move for several seconds (reckoned to be two to three minutes). At that point, the creature stood up straight (it had been semi-crouched behind the tree), walked into the open and looked directly at the boat, and then turned and walked slowly up the bank and into the heavier trees. The distance was later to be estimated at 60 to 70 yards before the creature disappeared into the forest. D.R. described the creature as being 8 to 9 feet tall, covered with the exception of the face with reddish-brown hair.

"It was about 1:00 am on 10/21/06 when I was camping in the Palo Duro Canyon State Park for the Palo Duro Canyon trail run the following morning. I had gotten up from my sleep and was walking down to the public restroom when I heard something rustling in the trees off to the right of the road. I turned my flashlight towards the noise and was startled to see a very large chewbacca-like thing scream like it was startled and then it turned into the trees and quickly vanished. I had stopped stiff in my tracks and was scared to death. Not only had I never heard a sound like that before, but I had never seen anything like that. It was a darkish gray-brown color with hair all over its body, deep set eyes, about 7-8 feet tall, slender with long arms, and it moved very quickly.

"While fishing late one evening in the late summer of 1979 I had a brief encounter with something that I cannot readily explain. I was fishing at a pond in an open field across from some apartments that my grandparents and I were staying at until our house was ready. I had been fishing for about an hour when I got the feeling that someone or something was watching me. I wasn't in a secluded area, but there was no one else around. No activity at all from anybody. All of a sudden the birds and normal animal noises silenced like they do when a predator comes around. I could feel something watching me. I looked back to the south across the field to the fence line that divided the field. Along the fence line were several cedars ranging from 6 ft to 15 ft or so. I stared at what I thought was a small group of trees when something stepped out from them towards the fence. It was dark brown almost black with grass and debris in its hair like it had been laying down. It came up to the fence and watched me from beside a cedar tree, almost blending in with them. Frozen in fear all I could do was stare back. When it moved again I ran. I left my fish and my stuff right where it was. I ran for the fence that bordered the apts. I jumped the fence and ran home. I told my grandparents what had happened. To my surprise they sort of believed me. My Grandfather would not venture out at dusk to retrieve my gear, he said we would get it in the morning. The next morning we returned early to find that my tackle box had been knocked around like a toy, my rod was undisturbed, but my stringer of perch was gone. The only thing we found of that was a fish head between the pond and the fence line where I saw it.",Several ponds in the area.,Red River County,Texas,Summer,Report 8083: Boy encounters bigfoot while fishing on a pond just north of Detroit,33.66666,-95.27361,11/2/2002,8083,Class A,9vupxbzfeb,51.96,49.265,46.57,41.01,0.78,0.7,0.92,,,rain,,Rain starting in the evening.,4,9.16,90,9.19
"BFRO Investigators James Walker and Daryl G. Colyer have interviewed this witness extensively.  This report was filed on behalf of the witness, due to his inaccessibility to the internet. The most compelling testimony given by the witness involves an incident that occurred on another lease prior to the one he currently leases, but in the same general vicinity. Approximately 1992, the witness was hunting for deer in the late afternoon.  As he sat on a hunting stool, he continually scanned the surrounding terrain, and noticed some trees in a creek bed area with ""buck scrapes"" (marks made by male deer with antlers).  The witness focused on that particular area. After a while, the witness noticed a ""stump"" approximately 125 - 150 yards away that he had not earlier detected.  The witness raised his weapon and observed through his scope what appeared to be a large, gorilla-like animal standing very still, arms down by its side.  At this time, through the use of the rifle scope, the witness was able to observe the animal as though from a distance of only 25 - 30 feet.  The hunter now knew that he was not the only one doing the observing.  The animal was watching him every bit as much as he was watching the animal.  The witness described the animal as having rather thin hair on its body, but the hair almost had the appearance of being combed or groomed.  The color was described by the witness as being ""tawny-brown."" After approximately 15 - 20 minutes had elapsed, the witness heard a loud snap of a branch off to his left.  He broke visual with the creature to identify the source of the sound to his left.  When he attempted to regain visual of the creature, he could not do so.  Apparently the animal fled or hid very quickly.  The witness believes that the animal suddenly hid in the tall grass surrounding it in order to escape his scrutiny.  The witness conjectured that the loud snap that he heard was created as a diversion by another creature to distract him from the first creature. At that, the witness quickly left the area - leaving behind the stool and everything else that accompanied him with the exception of his weapon. The witness never once considered shooting the creature and further stated that he felt no hostility whatsoever.  He had absolutely no inclination to pursue or seek out the mystery animal. The creature was described as being ""gorilla-like"" in appearance, but very distinctly bipedal.  Height was estimated to be between eight to nine feet tall.  Estimated weight was between 400 - 500 pounds.  The face was similar to that of a gorilla.  The nose was flat but ""turned upward"" and the witness stated that he could actually see into the nose of the animal.  There appeared to be thin facial hair surrounding the mouth, almost in a beard-like fashion.  Hair on the animal had somewhat of a ""combed or groomed"" look.  The head had somewhat of a round shape and there was no appearance of a neck.  The shoulders appeared very wide.  The witness requested that a sketch artist contact him. This incident is one of many that the witness has experienced through the years.  However, none of the other incidents involved a visual identification of the creature.",,Red River County,Texas,Fall,Report 7168: Hunter and family has repeated encounters over two decades,33.845,-95.19722,11/16/2003,7168,Class A,9yh299r3rv,74.67,68.55,62.43,58.08,0.84,0.22,0.74,0,0,,,Overcast overnight.,4,6.67,110,2.09
"I was about 5 years old at the time. It was summer and the door was left open and the screen door closed. My grandfather had been in a wreck and his head had been in traction. He was laying on the couch fold out bed asleep. My grandmother and mother were in the other room with a friend playing a game of cards and I was playing with toys and watching The Price is Right (didn't have any choice - too small to change the channel) on tv. When I looked toward the door there was a 4 foot thing covered in a ruddy reddish brown fur. He was wide across the shoulders, sort of flat face watching me play with my toys. I walked up the the screen and we watched each other for a while. Its eyes almost like it was curious me like I was of it. I walked into the other room and to get my grandmother to show her this thing at the front door. But when she came it was gone. I never felt afraid of it nor did it act aggressive just curious about me or my toys. They pretty much discounted it as a child trying to get attention but to this day I can still see it in my mind every detail. And the following morning I took the toy outside and left it for the furry being. Never saw that toy again.

"I was duck hunting in waders at Lake Cherokee. After hunting that day, I was exiting the water onto the shore and looked to my right about 200 - 300 feet.

"I climbed out of my deer stand at about 9:30 because we had to look for a deer my cousin had shot late the evening before that we could not find because of the thick brush and darkness. Well I cut thru the brush, down across the creek and got about 200-300 yards from my cousin's stand when I heard my Uncle yell something at me. I couldn't hear what he said so I yelled back for him to keep talking so I could get his direction. I got about 100 yard from him. I couldn't see him yet but I could hear him. He said there's a gorilla over here in the tree looking at me. I told him he was crazy. He said there really is, come and look. So when I got to him he said it again. I asked him was he drinking in his stand. He said no come around here and look. So we walked from down below my cousin's stand around to the side of it in the oat patch. I looked up in the tree he showed me with my binoculars and I saw something but I couldn't tell what it was because my binoculars are small and one side is kind of messed up. So I used my rifle scope. At between 100-150 yards away I had my cross hairs right on its chest. It had orange-brown hair all over its body except around its eyes and mouth area. It stood straight up in the fork of the tree with it arms down to its side. It didn't look like a gorilla. It was about 6ft tall but it was hard to tell [for sure] at that distance. I told my Uncle let's walk over there and see what it does. So we got about 75 yards from it and I looked down and then back up and it was gone. We walked over by the tree that it was in and the only tracks I found was where something landed real heavy on its heels and seemed to walk heavy on the heels. The smell was the worst the I ever smelled. We looked down through the woods to a line of oak trees and saw two figures in the trees about 300yards out moving around. Oh I forgot to tell you my Uncle said that there was what seemed like a female on the branch over the male but when I got there it was gone. We watched them for about 20 minutes and then went back down to get the deer which I did find on the way up from the creek. We kept an eye out for what ever it was and the male did come back to the tree and then left as we where pulling the deer up to the road.

A fox, coyote, coon, etc. would not respond to this call.) After about 10 minutes of calling, I heard a sound from behind me that I could not identify. I was using a varmint light, which has a red filter. This light is not normally readily seen by predators. I shined the light toward the sound, and saw what I thought was a bear. It was dark in color, but everything was either light or dark because of the red filter. I have hunted in the West several times, and seen many bears. I initially thought that's what this was. But as stated earlier, a predator does not respond (normally) to this light. But this animal did. It stood up and moved away very rapidly on it's two ""hind"" legs. While on all fours, it appeared to be a bear. Upright, it appeared to be around 5-foot tall with a fairly large stride. I wasn't able to notice any other details because of the light source and because of how quickly it moved off. Bears do not move great distances on their hind legs, and especially not rapidly. It made this sound continuously as it moved away, gradually decreasing in volume until I couldn't hear it any longer.  I'm not sure what this was, but I'm quite certain what it was not, and it was not a bear, a hog, or any other animal native to this area. After a recent conversation with Daryl Colyer, he and Craig Woolheater encouraged me to make this report. I did not do so earlier because I simply had no idea there was a possiblilty this could have been a bigfoot-type animal.

"One evening a friend and I were riding my ATV through the Sam Houston National Forest. While riding down a straight and rather wide trail approximately 20 yards wide, I turned around to say something to my friend who was riding as passenger. Whenever I turned back around there was a large humanoid creature, approximately 6 – 6.5 foot tall, broad shouldered and thick in appearance, with either dark brown or black hair covering its entire body. It spooked me and I yelled at my passenger to look. When I yelled the creature turned and ran into the woods, (the creature made a quick turn upright and ran upright – this marks out the possibility of being a bear). My friend did not see it and asked what I was yelling about. I could not speak from awe. The creature was only approximately 40 – 50 yards in front of us in the wide open. I sped up the ATV to the location where the creature ran into the woodline. The limbs and brush were shaking back and forth but I did not see him again due to the thick underbrush East Texas is known for. It scared me at first and I downshifted the ATV as fast as possible and sped away, stopping several hundred yards down the trail to explain to my friend what I had just seen. It was an experience I will never forget, and who knows maybe it was meant just for me to see. I have told many people this story, most laugh.

"It was the evening before thanksgiving and as we have done for many years our extended family went camping near our parents  retirement home in Coldspring. There had been very bad weather the day before, bad enough that we considered not going; it was very cold, very wet, the power was out....the firewood was wet, yuck. This camping area is in the Sam Houston National Forest near Cleveland; it feels as though you are right in town because it's only a few minutes drive to the grocery store, but it's a very small store, and it takes a good half hour to get there on little country roads (sorry, I don't know their numbers). There is a small lake and a lot of marsh in the area. We set camp in the afternoon and then drove to pick up some family members at IAH at about 7pm; we then cooked dinner, sat by the smoky fire for a bit and decided to retire to our tents since it was quite cool and we had a bit to do the next day. My daughter, my dog, and myself waited up a bit in our tent for my husband to come in. After about 10 minutes of waiting and talking about how cold it was we turned off the tent light (yes, we have one of those battery powered clamp-on lights), the dog laid down on his dog bed and we were quiet. Within the next minute or less there were heavy footsteps quite near the tent, then a very quiet mis-step in some loose gravel; there followed a quiet grunt/growl. I said, ""oh, there he is finally,"" and my daugheter said ""uh huh.""  Well, nothing happened.  No husband unzipping the tent, no dog looking up expectantly, nothing. About twenty minutes later my husband came in and we went to sleep. Some time later, minutes or hours I can't honestly tell, we were wakened by a very loud cry, exactly like the ""whoops"" on the BFRO page. Most of the folks in camp that nite didn't hear anything as it only occured once; something however woke up myself and the two other adult women in the camp and was followed by the ""whoop""; as we were fairly far apart there was no talking between the tents.

"[First incident:] It was approximately midnight in late April 2005 when me and three other friends were hiking in the Sam Houston National Forest. The weather was clear and the temperature was approximately eighty degrees. We had stopped to take a break and two of the three friends that were with me had gone up ahead of me and another guy. When me and my buddy were resting and talking about where we were going to go next we heard a long drawn out howl just like the Ohio howl on this website. I interrupted my friend and told him to listen. Approximately thirty seconds later we heard it again, identical to the Ohio howl. The howl lasted for about seven to eight seconds both times. The howls came from approximately five to seven hundred yards away through the woods. I have heard every variation of howl of every known animal in these woods and this sounded like no normal animal. My buddy and I caught up with the other two that were in the group and asked them if they heard anything strange, to which they replied, ""No"". [Second incident:] This incident occurred in the Sam Houston National Forest in late May 2005 at approximately midnight. A friend and I decided to go on an expedition of our own down near the east fork of San Jacinto River right off of FM 2025. We were approximately three to four miles off of the roadway down on the river in the thick of the woods. We set up and then waited to let the noise from us getting prepared die down. After about thirty minutes of silence I did the best impersonation of the Ohio howl that I could in a series of three, but got no response. We waited for a while longer and then I did it again in a series of three howls. And to our surprise, something hollered back at us that was within two hundred yards. It wasn't the same as the Ohio howl but it was a long loud deep growl, unlike a hog snorting, and it did this approximately three to four times. After it did that there was a long series of chattering noises that came from two different animals in front and behind us, but we never could see it. This went on for about one minute. My friend that was with me got instantly freaked out and jumped on his four wheeler saying, ""come on, let's go, its right there!"" I was able to convince him to wait and listen. We waited for approximately twenty minutes until we heard nothing but insects again. I told my friend to keep watch that I was going to try something that Daryl Colyer had told me about. So I picked up a stick about the size of a man's forearm and I hit it on a nearby tree about six times in a row then stopped. I did this three times in about a twenty minute span. After the third time, from the other side of the river we could clearly hear something that sounded just like what i was doing, banging a limb on the side of a tree and it sounded like it had some force behind it. Whatever it was, it did this about one to two minutes and quit. We waited a while and I hit the tree again as well as did imitations of the Ohio howl but never got another response. We waited a while but never heard anything but coyotes again after that. I guess it is possible for woodpeckers to be up between midnight and 2am, however highly unlikely. I had never heard anything like the chattering we heard that night that made our hair stand up. The low deep grunt/growls were not hogs and did not sound anything like hogs. However, we never actually seen them.",,San Jacinto County,Texas,Summer,"Report 11987: Vocalizations, wood knocks and strange chatter heard in the Sam Houston National Forest.",30.46,-95.13,6/27/2005,11987,Class B,9vkm7306q7,92.76,81.09,69.42,70.23,0.7,0.05,0.71,0,0,,1015.63,Humid throughout the day.,11,7.3,141,1.56
"Where:  San Jacinto County, Evergreen, TX When:  My incident happen in November 1997, Thanksgiving week on Monday at about 11:15 am. From New Waverly driving east on SH150, turning on to FM  1725, one and ¼ mile in the Hillcrest Subdivision on Gale Haven Road. Gale Haven Road is a little road curves and it runs next to our property goes down to a dry creek bed as you come up out of the creek bed the road started to curve again in sort of an S shape. The weather was cool and sunny there were thick woods on both side of road. On the passenger side there was a dip for runoff and the property was fenced, the owner has longhorns on that property but the property was wooded.  On the driver side the woods were very thick and there was a deeper runoff, there were downed trees on the edge and no fence.   The fastest you could drive on this road was about 20-25 mph. I was driving a 1993 Saturn that was a standard transmission, I had let my daughter sit in the back with both of her friends and they were being laughing and talking enjoying the last few minutes before I took them home 20 miles away. They were around 15 at the time, I had to have them home by 12:00 noon thats why I remember the time.  At this location I can see our property in my rear view mirrow. As I came out of the dip the road curves to the passenger side and before the road curves to the other side.  I am facing the road and looking into the thicket ahead,  and  60 to 80 feet from my car in the thicket I see what I first thought was the haunches of a horse moving around I could only see the top part.  What I saw had shinny reddish hair and was like 7 to 8 feet high.    Then I remembered I didn’t see a tail.  As I go up this curve toward this thing I start to look at it a little closer and then this thing, that I thought was a horse, turns around and looks straight at me then crouches down and tries to hide behind a little tree and it’s sitting there looking at me.  The only thing that I clearly remember is that the eyes were big and black.  The expression on it’s face was surprise and the eyes followed me and I drove within 15 to 20 feet of it, as I drove by I turned my head and looked out the window.  I did see it in a crouched position and its head looking in my direction.  I don’t remember skin color and I looked  to see it crouching there, big thick arms, legs and a look of surprise.  I couldn’t have been driving more than 15 mph and I did not stop, I kept going. I honestly do not know what I would have done if it had sprang to its feet (I get scared really easy). I was so scared that I didn’t even stop at the stop sign and I was also scared I would flood the car since it was a standard.  The girls looked up and I couldn’t talk and I was finally able to talk I asked them if they had seen anything and they said no and I told them I thought I had seen something in the woods, then  I decided not to describe what I saw, I told them  it was nothing.  But I did see something there and it saw me.  If I had persisted with my daughter, she would have gone nuts, we would have never been able to live there ever again.  Later that day I told my husband about it and he didn’t believe me.   He started telling me he saw a ghost dressed in blue in the front yard when he went to work in the mornings.  So I didn’t mention it again. He would ask me about it from time to time and I stuck to my story and he stuck to his. After that I didn’t go into the woods anymore.  We had 2 ½ acres, we had cleared about 1 acre of our land and I wanted to clear all of it.  I used to work to clear little by little, my husband stopped helping me because the more I cleared the more he had to mow.   I didn’t like the woods that close to the house I wanted to see what was out there. Needless to say, my clearing days ended after that. I started closing the curtains at night, put lights all around the house.  When I drove home I would turn on the high beams to make insure that there was nothing out there on our property. Our land was not fenced.  And I know what is out there deer, hogs, I have chased billy goats and those longhorns out of my yard before and I know what they look like up close.  We now live in west Texas since 2007, and I have no regrets. We were located at the top of a little hill, the back part of our subdivision is lower and there are creeks and ponds in the back, and there were some parts that have really thick woods.   About a mile down FM 1725 there is another road called Dabney Bottoms that when it rains a lot, that road floods bad, you cannot drive thru there, even the road is unpaved thru that part.  Another 2 miles down the road on FM 1725 the Sam Houston National Forest starts, my husband use to hunt there, he said there was places on the Dabney Bottoms side of the forest that were really deep and very thick that you almost couldn’t hunt there.  He also said he had been in an area back there where he come across a place that smelled really bad and it looked like a place where several big things slept there, all the brush was flattened out. He just remembered smelling that smell at other times and always wondered what that was. I started asking the neighbors and they said they started getting their chickens killed or missing but they thought it was a skunk or fox.  I never even considered that it would have been a bigfoot, never entered my mind.  Then one day in February of 2009 my husband asked me to describe what I had seen a long time ago.  Then he asked me to read some of the articles on a bigfoot website and the same fear came over me and couldn’t believe other people were describing what I saw back then.","Driving East from New Waverly, Texas about 7 miles on SH 150, then left on FM 1725 go 1 1/2 miles on the left is Hillcreek Subdivision, turn right on Gale Haven Road passed Sandy Creek Rd.",San Jacinto County,Texas,Fall,Report 28873: Motorist recounts daylight sighting on her property east of New Waverly,30.31363,-95.17966,11/15/2007,28873,Class A,9vkk6nkm9n,65.58,51.89,38.2,28.62,0.33,0.13,0.18,0,0,,1026.17,Mostly cloudy in the morning.,5,10,358,4.96
"I don’t know if you want a report this old. I just saw a program on TV that made me think of it. It was either May or June of 2009. I was on assignment as a photographer for Texas Highways Magazine and The Texas State Travel Guide to photograph the Sam Houston National Forest among other East Texas locations on a multiple days trip. I found a place to park my state car and hiked into the woods, camera in hand, in late afternoon light to try to get some definitive shot of the woods. I was maybe a mile to two miles into the forest and came to a clearing where vegetation had been removed for power lines. I stopped for a while to watch the opposite tree line for a deer or rabbit or such to come out, get my shot and move on. After a few minutes there was a loud crashing noise on the other side of the clearing that startled me, as deer make almost no noise. Before I could react, a small juvenile black bear came out of the trees, stopped in the clearing edge and put its nose up in the air sniffing. It then abruptly turned around and ran back into the woods. I started to go after it for a photo, but thought better of it as its mother would undoubtedly be nearby. I decided to go back the way I had come to give them space. I had barely turned when I saw a huge dark shape about ten to twelve feet away through some very thick yaupon brush. I’m 6’3” and I was looking up at a twenty to thirty degree angle to its head and huge shoulders. Texas bears don’t get anywhere close to this size, more like an Alaskan Kodiak Bear in size. I froze. All of a sudden it’s hand moved and a 2-3” diameter tree trunk about fifteen feet long came flying toward me. I ran like a werewolf was after me, and it might have been. I was back at the car in just a few minutes, clothes torn and bleeding from cat’s claw and briars trying to stop me. I jumped in the car and peeled out, not stopping til I reached Coldspring. I parked the car and sat there until quite late as I pondered what had happened. It was only then that I concluded I might have just encountered a Sasquatch. I never told anyone but my wife as I might have gotten fired for being “unstable”. I had to go back two weeks later to a different part of the forest to get my photo I had missed previously.

"Only in the past few years have I associated a previous experience with an investigative report. I presumed at the time I was not believing what I saw. I was 16 yrs old at the time and was out with my cousin and a few others ""coon hunting"", south of Tyler, Texas in a creek bottom known as ""Marlow Bottom"". We heard the dogs ""on tree"" and went to see what coon (raccoon) was treed. We approached with our coleman lanterns, flashlights and guns drawn. I believe there were five of us there...we saw a huge animal of some sort, covered in red fur, flaying it's arms and making a dreadful howling noise toward the dogs. One of us, I don't remember who, shot toward the animal and there was a terrifying growl that absolutely scared the wits out of all of us, including the dogs. We immediately left the area at a run. At the time we didn't think anyone would believe us, so we chalked all of it up to a disbelief and forgotten.

"There are three incidents in roughly the same location to report.  These incidents happened on our friends 400 acre ranch. During the first incident, my son, 14, was invited to his friends ranch earlier this summer or fall, 2003.  The closest city to this ranch is Tyler, TX.  The ranch is very large and out in the middle of nowhere.  This area is a very wooded area with some hills and trails. On the first occasion my son and a friend were riding on a 4-wheeler on a trail where there was a fence running parallel with the trail.  My son said they were going approx 20 miles an hour and he could hear loud footsteps keeping pace with the 4-wheeler.  His friend who was on the back said that he also heard the footsteps and could see the trees ""moving"". On the second occasion, my son was invited to go camping on the ranch with his friends from his youth group.  They were driving the 4-wheelers up to the camp spot after dark.  The camping spot was roughly the same area where the first incident occured 3-4 weeks earlier. Coming around a corner, my sons friend said the lights from the 4-wheeler picked up ""glowing eyes"" about 7 feet above the ground that my sons friend saw.  The friend said that he didn't see great detail other than the ""glowing eyes"" and a bushy or hairy face. The latest incident at the same ranch occured at around 12:00 am at night on 1/15/04.  My son and his friends were riding 4-wheelers again and one of the 4-wheelers got stuck in the mud.  My sons friend went to get a chain or rope to pull the 4-wheeler out of the mud.  My son said he heard a loud moaning sound off in the distance.  His friend who was with him did not hear it because he said he was thinking about something else and wasn't paying attention. My son described it as one long moan.  He called me the morning of 1/16/04 and told me about it.  I remembered the BFRO website and knew there were sound recordings there that we could compare. On 1/19/04, we listened to the four recordings on the BFRO website and my son indicated that it sounded exactly like the one with the 3 long, deep moaning sounds with the dog barking in the background.

"My two sons and I decided to go fishing. We went down to the Concho River to a sort of remote area. We were trying some new bait we bought. It was getting dark but the fish were biting good, so we sat there a little longer catching fish.  I didn’t have a flashlight, so I told my boys we needed to get going. But we stayed until we could only see shadows of our poles. We heard a noise off to our left like something was walking toward us through some real heavy woods and brush. As I looked over you could here and see the birds flying out of the trees like they had been scared. It looked like one of those horror movies the way they were acting. The footsteps kept getting closer.  I could tell it was no small animal.  My youngest boy started to cry. We jumped up, as the footsteps got closer.  I yelled to scare off whatever it was, but it didn’t stop moving toward us. My older boy [15], started saying dad what do we do?  I told them to real in their poles fast. The trail down to the river was about ten feet to our left beside a 6-foot tall fence. On the other side of that was the trees and brush where the noise was coming from. So the only way out was to walk toward the fence then up the trail trough some trees.  The footsteps got right up to the fence line. So I ran toward the fence waving my arms and yelling at the top of my lungs to try to scare it off. It didn’t move. The brush and trees are so thick at the fence you couldn’t see anything but shadows. I told my boys to stay on my right side and get up to the truck. As we made it up the trail, I put my boys inside the truck.  My boy dropped his fishing pole down on the trail, so I went back down to get it.  As went back down I was cursing at what ever it was, to come out that I would beat it to death. Still no movement.  As leaned down to pick up the pole, I looked through the fence to see what it was. I stand 6 feet 1 inch tall; all I could see was a shadow of something that made me look small. I grabbed the pole and backed up the trail to the truck. As I got to the truck it started running up through the trees toward us. We jumped in the truck and started it.  I spun the truck around to shine my lights at the trees. It took off running back the way it came from.  We got the heck out of there.  I'm not much of a person to get scared but this thing made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. I have never been that scared in my life. Even talking about it makes my hair stand up. I have tried to think that this thing was a bum or some one trying to scare us on purpose, but the way I tried to scare it off you would think that it would have made some sort of noise when it stopped at the fence line. I went back the next day, crossed the fence to see what if any, evidence I could find. The trees and brush are so thick I couldn’t see anything.  I know ill never go back to that spot at night again. I don’t know if it was a big foot or not, and I’m not saying it was. All I know is it was the biggest thing I've ever seen, and like I said, it scared me and my boys worse than I’ve ever been scared.",,Tom Green County,Texas,Summer,Report 16499: Possible stalking on the Concho River outside San Angelo,31.44815,-100.4219,8/1/2006,16499,Class B,9v8dfugnb0,101.09,88.42,75.75,64.11,0.48,0.13,0.23,0,0,,1010.55,Mostly cloudy in the morning.,11,10,169,9.96
"I went to the river camp in the afternoon, at the end of October 1999, to fill my deer feeders. I had a late start and I was afraid I would get stuck (if it started raining) in the bottom so I parked a 1/2 mile or so from the camp. There was a chance of rain in the area which was good because it had been dry, but it doesn't take much for this area to get wet, quick. I filled two, 2 and 1/2  gallon buckets with feed corn and took off walking down the road that leads past the first feeder. I noticed before I got to it that the feeder was missing. After a closer look I found the feeder hanging in the tree. It had been wrapped around the limb it was tied to, like a teather ball. The feeders we were using were made of 4"" heavy PVC drain pipe about 2 feet long. The rope was about 10 feet long.  I was thinking of climbing up the tree (or better of it) when I saw something move to my left. It was about 75 feet away and was hiding  behind a large oak tree. I had seen it for just a second and thought I was seeing some strange looking, shaggy hog.  As soon as I moved toward it, it started to move off. I followed it for a couple of minutes in this fashion but I could never get a good look. It was very good at keeping the brush and trees between it and myself . As this is in a place where the river over flows regularly (the run-off end of a slough), there is excessive amounts of dead trees, brush and briars at times. Sometimes it piles up so thick, it looks like beaver dams. I could only catch glimpes of it because of the thick cover.  Because of it's shaggy appearance I had begun to believe it was an emu or maybe two. I know this sounds strange, but a couple of weeks earlier, a man in one of the hunting clubs up the road told me someone had emptied a cattle trailer full of unwanted emus in their club and I was convinced this is what I was looking at. We continued on this way movin up the river. We came to the old R/R crossing at another camp house and boatramp across the  river. We were to a point were it/they either had to step into the open, go back the way it/they came or turn and face me.  When it stepped out I really couldn't believe it, at first.  It was a bigfoot, sasquatch, wooleybooger, or whatever you want to all it. There is nothing else it could have been. I was 50 feet or less away from it. The left side and back were to me and I couldn't see the face. It was about 7 feet tall, walking upright, and covered with long shaggy hair. It was longer on the arms (which hung to the knee) and covered its (hands ?). The hair was dark gray-ish black, and reminded me of old hay rolls that had been left out in the pasture, uncovered. It had huge, wide shoulders and the head just sort of blended into them. I did not see the feet. I would estimate its weight at 300 lbs. Although it was large, I would have to discribe it as ""lanky"".  As it moved over the bank, paused, and moved down to the river out of sight, I noticed the hair on its rear end was thinner and I could see its butt. It was black and I could see the muscles working. The sighting lasted about 10 seconds. By then my hands were shaking from the adrenaline rush I was having. I haven't had a rush like that since I was a little boy, about to take my first deer (or try, I missed). After I steadied myself (20 seconds or so) I decided to go see where it went. I figured it had crossed the river. You can walk across here easily when the river is down (and it was). I took about ten steps and a very loud ""snap"" came from directly behind me, at about 200 ft. That's when I left. I went straight back to my feeder, dumped the corn out on the ground and got the hell out of there. I was feeling flighty, to say the least. There is no doubt in my mind that when I started following this animal, it was on all fours. If at anytime it would have been on two legs (at 7 feet tall) I could have seen it clearly. It took full advantage of the thick cover. It didn't stand until it reached the opening of the river crossing. I've heard the ""booger monster"" stories all my life, but never really believed them. I now realize this animal has been there all along. I've seen some strange things, in the woods, I couldn't explain. Some of them don't seem so strange anymore.

"Me and my wife set out to go on an overnight camping trip in the country. I go hiking and camping fairly often and my wife sometimes accompanies me on my outings. This time we went about 30 miles southeast from where we live, in Nacogdoches to some remote family-owned land. Our land is on a small blacktop county road and few people live there. Only one neighbor lives close by, an old woman across the road. The road parallels Sam Rayburn reservoir for several miles and is a short distance from it at this point. It was late afternoon when we arrived there. Wildlife are plentiful in this area, with deer, bobcat, hogs, etc. and since I occasionally would hunt deer there, I put out some corn for them to get ready for season and then we set up our camp. We have a small storage building that family and friends use to sleep in on our hunting and camping outings. After we were set up for the night, I started a fire about five yards away from the building to roast hot dogs on. It was beginning to get dark at this time. We have a camcorder that we always take on our trips and I filmed the outing. I remembered that as it had gotten dark, dogs could be heard across the nearby road, barking like crazy. Up to this point I filmed everything, but since I was getting hungry, I stopped to make me some supper. My wife was sitting down on a makeshift chair and I was at the fire. Suddenly, a loud howl, or hoot came from a nearby creekbottom, a distance of about 70 yards. The sound is best described as a ""WOO-WAAH"" sound. It was very loud and sounded almost baboon-like, but also much like a human's vocal chords. We were both shocked by the piercing sound, but before we could react, whatever it was came to within approximately 8 yards and screamed again. My wife jumped from her chair sideways and ran to the shed spraining her ankle in the process. I didn't know what the sounds were, but I am sure they were NOT deer, hogs or hoot owls, or anything else that I have EVER heard. I could not be sure if it was not some prankster, although someone would risk getting shot coming to a person's camp at night like that. I ran to the shed to get my pistol which I always carry on our outings, all the while the ""animal"" screamed the same sound in rapid succession, about 7 times in all.The sound emanated from behind a pile of tree limbs placed there on previous outings. I went to the edge of our camp and shined my flashlight into and around the pile and held my pistol ready, but no more sounds were heard. I couldn't see any eyes shining in my flashlight beam either. Even though we were a little unnerved by the event, I planned to go ahead and make our beds for the night, but my wife's ankle was beginning to swell and she was in pain, so we packed our things and went back home. I have gone back a few times since then, but have not noticed anything strange. So if it wasn't a bigfoot, fine I just don't really know what it was. All the experienced outdoorsmen I have talked to about the sounds say they have never heard anything like them either.",Take Hwy103E from Lufkin approximately 24 miles from the Lufkin loop.,Nacogdoches County,Texas,Fall,Report 3390: Campers are disturbed by strange vocalizations in Piney Woods of East Texas,31.33333,-94.33334,10/15/2003,3390,Class B,9vsfm2h9cu,75.84,64.025,52.21,48.04,0.67,0,0.66,0,0,,1019.45,Clear throughout the day.,6,10,137,1.37
"It happened on November 17, 2007.  My family and I were hunting on a family friends ranch in Goldthwaite.  It was mid afternoon, and we were taking turns riding horses.  When it came my turn to ride, my sister-in-law joined me on another horse.  The horses were giving a lot of attitude, and not willing to comply with our requests of direction.  So we were having to spin them and kick them cause they didnt want to leave the coral area.  But once I got mine to leave then my sister-in-law's followed.  We walked off and a couple hundred yards away, the coral disappeared.  She and I were just admiring the land and talking.  I then noticed that there were no animals around, and there wasnt any animal sounds either, birds included.  All I could hear was the footsteps of the horses, and she and I talking.  Right about then, there was a strong odor of a dirty wet dog, and the horses started acting different.  Their ears kept perking up, and then moving back.  I really didnt think anything of it at the time cause I was joking with my sister and we both started laughing.  Right about then both our horses jumped like something had startled them, which made my sister jump and let out a small scream.  I turned around in the saddle and looked back and to the left of where we were about 10 feet away to see two pine trees shaking bad.  The two trees had grown close enough to each other as to have their branches interwoven so you couldnt see in between them.  They were tall trees about 10 feet tall.  It was as if something had grabbed the branches about 5 to 6 feet up and was shaking them which in turn was making both of the trees shake from top to trunk.  I didnt say anything to my sister-in-law about it cause I didnt want to startle her.  We continued on for a little bit, then we turned around and headed back to the coral.  I never saw anything.  They have cattle, goats, and horses on their land.  There is also deer, turkey, and he occasional hog, bobcat, and mountain lion.  I am 32 and I have been hunting most of my life, and I have never seen or experienced anything like that before.  I have smelled that odor before, but I have never thought anything of it.",I don't want to include the location of the ranch cause I don't have the owners permission as of right now.,Mills County,Texas,Fall,Report 23246: Violent tree shaking startles horses and riders on a ranch near Goldthwaite,31.4771,-98.53998,11/17/2007,23246,Class B,9v9gjdjrkh,74.87,66.69,58.51,50.22,0.63,0.04,0.25,0,0,,,Mostly cloudy overnight.,4,9.96,195,4.54

"In January of this year (04) my girlfriend and I were on our way to visit family in Kountz, Texas.  We share an apartment in a suburb of Houston.  The quickest route to my mom and stepdad's house is through Cleveland, Texas and take 105 from there to almost Kountz. [At] approximately midnight,  we left from Kingwood and traveled through Cleveland onto 105. We had been on 105 about 20 minutes (about 45 minutes from Kingwood) we were approaching the Trinity River bottom when I noticed something in the center of the road.  My girlfriend was dozing beside me and I yelled thinking we were about to be in an accident.  She sat up and screamed that we were about to hit 'him'.  I locked the brakes of her truck up and when I did whatever it was stood up in the road and started to 'run' to our right towards the woods. My girlfriend, started to open her door and I grabbed her to stop her.  She yelled that it was a 'bigfoot'.  I had heard of them, I mean who hasn't, but to be honest until that very moment, I would never have believed that they existed.  By the time I looked up from her the creature was standing on the side of the road watching us.  When she opened her door the creature made like a squalling sound and turned into the woods. I think it was around 7 feet tall.  I am not too sure I do know it was quite a bit taller then myself.  It was black in color but it had what looked like mud on its legs and arms.  The fur or hair was long.  It was on my girlfriend's side of the truck about 10 feet away and she said its hands were long and the thumbs were 'not right'.  I am not too sure what she meant other then they looked longer I think, too be honest not too sure how to describe that. Where the thing was squatting in the road was a doe that had been hit by a car.  I am not sure if it was looking or feeding on the doe but it had been moved by it.  You could see where the creature had shifted the animal on the road or at least it looked like that when I got out to look.  I have read on here, when I decided to post the incident. that there was an 'oder' a lot of times.  When we got out I really could not remember an oder or anything else that smelled strange.

"My wife and I were crossing the Trinity River on Highway 105 just before sunset on May 29, 2004 after having been to a Cardinals-Astros baseball game. The west bank of the Trinity was a long sand bar, and there were a few people (ten - fifteen) spread out along the sandbar doing various things. There were a few kids and a dad camping, two guys sitting on a tailgate, there was a couple farther down fishing, and there was another truck backed up to the sandbar with its stereo playing. My wife and and I drove down to the sandbar, had to engage the four-wheel drive to avoid getting stuck and turned around to go back to the highway (Hwy 105). We got back out on the highway and my wife asked me to drive on across the bridge to the other side. I did so. My wife saw what she called ""a waterfall"" off the left side of the bridge (actually it was just water running over rocks in a small creek off the Trinity). We turned off on a dirt road just past the bridge, drove over a small wooden bridge over my wife's ""waterfall"" and came to a gate that was locked with two padlocks. Keep in mind that the area is very heavily wooded, swampy and marshy in areas and highly inhospitable, once you step foot into the woods. At the gate, we got out of my truck. We climbed the gate just to look around the area. We could hear the music and the kids playing across the river (probably 1/4 of a mile back across the bridge). On the other side of the gate, the road turned into a two-track trail. There had been vehicles down there probably within the last month. We walked down the trail. The sun was setting and it was starting to get dark. This was very impromptu and we had not planned for this jaunt at all. My wife had heels on! I walked on ahead, probably thirty feet ahead of my wife. There was a sign that indicated that the area was a private hunting club area. We were very quiet and made very little sound. It was then that I saw it - about forty yards down the trail, where the trail turned sharply to the left. ""It"" leapt across the trail much like a long-jumper, landed on the right side of the trail and leapt again into the woods - quickly, quietly, in the blink of an eye. It was a rusty-red color, about six feet tall, and was extremely, extremely fast. In an instant, my mind tried to ascertain what it was I saw. I kept telling myself, ""No way. No way."" But - my data banks could not process it or link it to any other creature that I had ever seen. I saw no face, and do not remember seeing arms or feet - but I did see an upright something about six feet tall leap ten feet across the trail and spring into the woods. I turned to whisper loudly to my wife, ""DID YOU SEE THAT!?"" No. She was busy dealing with a slimey, slithery something that slithered across her foot. She was quite distraught, and her encounter happened at exactly the second that mine occurred. When she realized what had happened, she quickly jogged up to me and we jogged to spot of the crossing. When we arrived at the crossing area, we could hear the animal still running through the woods, sending birds to flight near its path. It was then that I smelled a musky smell, much like a horse actually. We looked for tracks of any nature and found absolutely nothing. The creature cleared the road and the road was the only place that tracks would have been made. We turned to look to the left, and there in the woods was a clump of uprooted trees with fresh sod still on the roots, as though they had recently been put there. I am sorry, but I can't say with certainty that what I saw was a bigfoot, but I can say with certainty that what I saw was: 1. Rusty-red (orangutanish); 2. Approximately six feet in height; 3. Incredibly fast; 4. Appeared bipedal and upright; 5. Not a deer, coyote, cat, horse, human, fox, bear, wolf, hog, dog or any other indigenous animal that I have seen in Texas. (I was raised in the backwoods of East and Central Texas). We had no cameras with us, but even if we had, the creature was way out of sight before I could have drawn any camera. And he was way too fast for any hope of pursuit. We surmised that perhaps he had been watching the people across the river from a very safe and secure position - until he saw us coming up the road, at which time he fled in a panic. He probably saw us long before we saw him. When I first saw him, he was in mid-air leaping across the road. He touched down and sprung up and into the woods. We heard him for a few seconds after we arrived at the crossing area and then it went silent, save for the people noises from across the river. We thought that he may have stopped and surveilled us from a hidden position in the woods. We looked around for just a few minutes and had to return to the truck - it was getting dark in a hurry and we were largely unequipped.",,Liberty County,Texas,Spring,Report 8790: Man sees an upright creature jump across wooded trail,30.26861,-94.79333,6/3/2004,8790,Class A,9vks4yjx7m,89.06,80.655,72.25,70.49,0.82,,0.52,0,0,,,Humid throughout the day.,0,,42,2.52

"First off I was a young boy when this happened so please forgive some memory errors. I was riding my bike in the woods and going home on a trail, I could ""feel"" something watching or ""following"" me. I raced out of the woods to a better trail I could hear in the bush as something was keeping pace with me. The bush was being thrashed about as if it were chasing me or just following me. I cleared the woods and turned to look and I could see something that had reddish-brown hair all over it. It stood very tall well over 8 feet. It had ""blackened skin"" along the facial areas that I could see. This incident has haunted my childhood and adulthood dreams. The area in which I had seen this ""creature"" is now cleared and a subdivision is built upon it. Most of it is still very wooded.

"As a son of residents of Liberty County, I am reporting a possible encounter for my parents. Not clearly remembering which day, but it was early May when my parents seen something strange.

It had huge long arms, which one arm hit the ground to help it move faster. It had a wide, slouching, pear-shape body with long legs.

"As a teenager from the early seventies up until 1980, I hunted this area. Numerous times I had mentioned a smell to a friend which I described as somewhere between a skunk and a wet dog. My friend acknowledged that he had smelled it several times himself. We blew it off as being some type of plant or weed, but as I began smelling it more often I could tell it was some type of animal as opposed to a plant or weed. I began thinking that it was probably ferral hogs. As I continued to get older and continued to squirrel hunt these same areas, I began to notice that every time I smelled this odor, there were no squirrels moving or any wildlife for that matter. I do not know exact dates or even the year in which these incidents occured, but it was in the mid to late seventies. I have been reluctant to tell anyone about these incidents. 1978: The first visual experience that I had came deep in the woods from the road. I had walked about a mile down in the woods where I came upon a pinoak flat.I could see all the way through the flat to the other side which was about 150-175 yards. On the other side of the flat was a stand of reset pine all about 15 ft. tall with high dead grass underneath. Immediately I noticed something laying under a pine tree across the flat. At first it looked like the area below the tree and the trunk of the tree had been burnt out. As I eased closer it began to look like a gorrila laying under the tree. I am a pretty stealthy person in the woods and I told myself I am seeing things, but I am going to try and get closer to this thing just to prove to myself I am not seeing this. As I moved within 100 yards or so, I could see that I was not crazy. It's head was moving and at this time I could tell it's color was gray with a black gorrila face. The adrenalin kicked in, I checked my gun, put some trees between myself and this thing and proceded to try and get closer, peering around the trees every few feet to see if it was still there. I got to within 50-75 yards and peered around the tree and it was gone.The floor of the pinoak flat was dry with a lot of crunchy leaves and twigs. I knew I was going to scare it off before I could get as close as I liked. After I noticed that it was gone I sat down in the flat for about an hour and did not see any wildlife at all. I then got up and went over to area where I had seen it and was hit with ""that smell"" and the grass was mashed down underneath the pine. At first I don't think that it knew I was there, because it was moving it's head and acting unconcerned. As I tried to sneek up on it though, It deffinately sensed my presents or heard me crunch a twig. I know it never visually made me out, because I kept trees between myself and it the whole time. 1979: It had rained sometime between 3am and when I had set out to go squirrel hunting. It was very foggy and misty on this morning and the woods were damp and very quiet. I came upon a large thicket and sat down against a tree at the edge of the thicket. I instantly started to smell something. As it got lighter, light enough to shoot, I could hear something in the thicket. Also I noticed there were no squirrels moving. I thought that there were some hogs in the thicket. I sat in this spot longer than I normally would sit somewhere without seeing anything, because of the sounds I heard coming from the thicket. About mid morning I was hearing something sniffing the air and making low, deep, grunting sounds. This was no hog! I decided to play a trick that I have used before on game in thickets and throw a two foot section of a dead limb over and beyond the sounds hoping to flush it out to my side. When I did this it made a deep and louder primate type grunt at me. The sniffing of the air also became more pronounced and no hog breathes like this. I then threw another stick into the thicket and received the same grunts and sniffing, only louder. About 20 min later I heard it moving through the thicket and then heard a huge, two legged splash into a body of water on the other side of the thicket, followed by grunts and heavy breathing. There is no doubt in my mind what I had encountered was a bigfoot in the thicket. Although I never saw him, this was something I had never experienced in the woods before. After the splash and the exit, I made my own hasty exit back to the road.","It has been twenty years since I have hunted there.

"Me and my family had moved to the Mongomery county area in October of 2001.In december I had noticed a old logging road leading into the Sam Houston National Forest from the sub-division which was still under development at the time.I haven't hiked since I was a teenager so I decided to see where this road went when weather permitted.In April 2002 I had taken some vacation time from work and one afternoon after mowing I thought I would go for a walk a routine I continued for several days going further down the road and deeper into the woods with each trek.I had seen evidence of deer, hog, squirrel and even bear in the area. On the sixth day I walked by an area that had springs on both sides of the trail which alternated sides every so often. I noticed on this trip there was no animal sounds or activety and I felt watched. So I stopped and surveyed my surroundings and to the east of me about 25yds in the thick underbrush something quite robust in size and dark in color seemed to be crouched between a couple of trees looking in my direction. I thought it was a large hog or maybe a bear so I turned south heading toward home and this creature moved along with me keeping a distance of approximately 15-30yds between us at all times. We continued this kind of cat and mouse routine for about 20-25 minutes. I stopped to releave myself. Then suddenly I don't know what possessed me to turn into the woods toward this creature. It stopped and crouched very low to the ground and remained perfectly still. I had gotten into about 10 yds. and I got wind of a strange odor I can't describe I heard a low gutteral growl coming from the creature's area. I could see it was very dark in color and almost lying in a prone position much like a sniper lining up a shot it and human like legs only very hairy I could make out thick arms and shoulders also covered with thick hair probibly no more 1-2"" in length. It was down almost as if it was tring to hide it's face. I would estimate it to be no more than 6ft.tall.The hair on my neck stood up when I heard movement of something large moving in woods from accross the trail behind me. I moved quckly back onto the trail and it seemed I wasn't being followed so I slowed my pace, by this time I was about 100-125 yards from the point I had urinated I turned and saw this dark figure walk upright out of the east woods and stop at my puddle area it squatted for a few second then stood up and looked directly at me for a few more seconds. It head turned abruptly toward the west woods and much larger dark being came slightly into view they both watched me as I back peddled watching them for another dozen or so yards when I decide home was the best place to be and ran off.",Hwy105@Crockett Martin,Montgomery County,Texas,Spring,Report 10733: Hiker has daytime encounter in Sam Houston National Forest,30.31667,-95.32,4/17/2002,10733,Class A,9vkhqyyp7h,84.47,77.27,70.07,70.4,0.8,0.73,0.16,0,0,,1018.19,Mostly cloudy until evening.,6,9.37,144,9.03
"Deer hunting in the Sam Houston National Forest last November (2003). Near dark, I heard what sounded like a large limb or small tree snap. I listened, but heard nothing further.  Next day, I returned before sun-up, and spent the day hunting the area.  Late afternoon, I hid in a clump of small trees near the edge of the field.  As darkness fell, I heard a mumbling sound, like someone was whispering.  No words could be made out, although individual syllables were definately distinguishable.  The sound was coming from the thick woods and sounded maybe 300 yards distant.  Sounded quite human, but carried far better than I would think human whispering would.  Most syllables seemed to start with ""s"" sounds.  I listened for a while, then said ""who's there?"" No reply, and silence for maybe 10 minutes.  Then the chattering resumed.  The source of the sounds seemed to move around, but I took it to be one critter, changing location.  It was very dark by now, and I turned on my flashlight and moved into the woods to try to see what was making the sounds.  As I walked, the source of the chattering seemed to maintain it's distance.  I spotted a ""hair"" on a sapling bent over the game trail that I was following. It (the ""hair"") was later analyzed by a competent scientist and determined to be of plant origin. As I walked, I realized that I would have to be within 10 or 20 yards of something to see it. Not likely, so I reversed direction and left for the night. No odors were noticed.  I have returned to the location many times since, and found nothing.  That is until a few weeks ago, and almost a year after my first ""encounter"". October, 2004, same location: Bow hunting, I spotted a few does on the way in, but could not get a clear shot. I passed. Later, kicked up something, but had no visual contact (probably a deer). Near dark, I decided to walk the fire trail quietly.  A few hundred yards in, I found a somewhat human shaped footprint along the side of the firetrail.  It was the same length as my size 12 EEE boot [14 inches], but quite a bit wider at the ""toe"" end.  The ""toes"" also seemed to end rather evenly, and not the arched, rounded look of a human track. As I photographed, I noticed an odor, mild at first, and quickly becoming quite powerful. I would describe it as complex, layered. The predominant odor was of sour sweat. I could also smell decaying flesh, and a musky undertone. I finished photographing the best track (there were several other ""impressions""), and photographed the woods directly behind me, from where I felt the odor eminated. I slowly and quietly walked back to my truck (20 minutes), and set my bow in the bed of the pickup as I retreived my keys from my pocket. It was completely dark by now, and overcast. Something growled at me. It was close, maybe 25 yards. The growl lasted between 1 and 2 seconds. I waited a good 5 minutes staring at the woods where the growl came from, then reached to my flashlight and turned it on. Nothing. The woods are incredibly thick here, and I could hide from someone easily in there. I had at least expected to see eye-shine. I keep plaster in my truck after the former incident, last November. Although I was entertaining the thought of going back in to make a casting, the growl made me think better of it. Had I been carrying my sidearm or a rifle, I would have done so, but not with a bow in complete darkness. That growl, while not loud, sounded serious. I headed out to develop the film, then home.","Little Lake Creek Wilderness Area, Sam Houston National Forest.",Montgomery County,Texas,Fall,Report 9627: Hunter hears strange chattering and finds tracks in Sam Houston National Forest,30.52694,-95.71278,10/29/2004,9627,Class B,9v7vwj206d,87.57,80.505,73.44,72.16,0.83,0.43,0.55,0,0,,1014.79,Humid and partly cloudy throughout the day.,5,9.23,167,5.02
"After storm, power went out, so I got flashlight, rubber boots and poncho on to walk the powerline up to main road. We had alot of lightening during storm, so wanted to check lines for damage. I  walked the line up to main road and found a place that lightening hit, so was walking back to house up drive. By the way, I live on 47 acres so the drive is long and winding to the house. I came around bend towards house and looked up and noticed two white dots. I thought they were lights from power company, working on lines, but as I got closer I noticed them blink. I got a little nervous, so I kept flashlight on them. At first I thought it was a deer then realized they were way to high to be deer. As I got closer I guessed they were about 6 to 8 ft. off ground. They blinked again and the air had an iron musky smell. When I shined the light again in the direction I noticed a dark figure, big and bulky [it was] hard to tell because the flashlite wasn't very bright. But it blinked again, I ran and fell in mud.

"Well in my case just a visual sighting. I was a good distance away so I didnt hear any sounds. In the summer of 2003 I had an experience that will for ever be burned in the front of my mind. I was with some family members and a friend, we had went horse back riding on a hunting lease that was not in use due to summertime. We was riding on the dirt roads crossing through-out the lease, when we came to then end of a road. We then started back the way we had just rode. About quarter to a half mile back I had stopped to look at a dead coral snake I hadnt noticed on the way to the dead end. I was facing towards the dead end, when for some reason I looked up towards the dead end. When from outa no-where a very large animal (creature) cleared the width of the road from left to right with about 15 ft from one edge of the brush line to the other. It was completely covered in hair that was redish-brown in color. I turned to the other riders and asked if they had just seen that. They wasnt turned around like I was and was riding in the opposite direction. I told them I just had seen a bigfoot but they tried to explain it away as a cow or deer. I have never seen a cow clear that much distance even at a dead run, I know deer can but this animal (creature) was upright and I could clearly see the motion of the arms like it had made a running jump. I kinda got the feeling it was tracking us threw the woods or that when I had looked towards the dead end road that we had just went down that something was watching us.

"My dad and I were walking on the Lone Star Hiking trail loop, in Sam Houston National Forest.  We were on the loop back towards to the car.  There had been forest fires in the region and there were soft ash spots all around. We had just taken a brake and then were off again.  We were stepping over a log when I noticed what looked like a footprint in the ash. We looked at it and it was definitely a barefoot foot.  You could see the outlines of toes.  And having done research before hand I know in ape footprints there is an arch in the middle, which this print did have.  To make sure it wasn’t just a harder spot I touched it and it was as soft as the rest so there is no other explanation for why that was there. We looked around for other prints.  We didn’t find any.  But all the ground around it was harder and not ash, so it would have been hard to make an impression.  I jumped on it and no impressions were made I weight around 205lbs.

"Just wanted to acknowlege that myself & my sister sighted a bigfoot, or what looked like one in the 60s in East Texas at my grandparents home in the Piney woods. It was in the summer and we could see out the bedroom window. There was a full moon and we heard something step on branches or twigs. We looked out the window and saw a big, hairy animal and my grandfather knocked the screen out of the window and shot. The animal bellowed or roared. About that time we heard him running and saw him clear the barb wire fence that separated the pasture from the area around the house. He cleared that fence, just practically stepped over it and there was a creek on down the pasture area, Boggy Creek, it was a spring creek with lots of pine and cedar trees. We had a lynx or bobcat on that creek, too.

"It was early July of 1988, and I was a Boy Scout at Worth Ranch for Summer Camp in Palo Pinto, Texas.

"I was recently discussing your web site with a friend and was directed to the sounds that were recorded and placed on your web site.  Initially I laughed it off.

It was cold and clear with a light wind.  I was sitting on the ground backed into a cedar tree.  At one point I could hear something walking up behind me.  I could tell it wasn't a hooved animal by the sound the feet made when it walked.  I waited about 10 minutes looking for it to step out of the brush.  That's when I heard that sound.  It couldn't have been more than 20 ft away, because it was so loud I had to put my hands over my ears.

"I was hog hunting from a tree stand next to the Sabine River. I had gone to my stand around 5:30 AM, put out sliced apples and table scraps to hold the hogs for a few minutes for a shot. I got in my tree stand and waited for the woods to settle down and the sun to rise. At sunup, I heard hogs rooting around, working the river's edge towards me. I could first see them to my left at about 45 degrees, about 50 yards out. No clear shot, waiting for them to get to my bait area, I noticed movement to my right about 80 yards out. Putting my rifle scope on it, I could see only the side of something's face. It was dark, hair covered and slowly moving its head around looking in the direction of the hogs. At this time it quickly moved to another tree. I could see most of its body, it was huge, standing on two legs, slowly looking around the tree at the hogs. At this time I was quite afraid but tried to keep my scope on it study its features. The hogs were still feeding towards my bait area and the animal was working towards the hogs. It moved quickly and disappeared. It quickly reappeared moving to another tree, still looking at the hogs. I could again study its features. At this time I was quite afraid but tried to keep my scope on it. Its movement from tree to tree was a quick leap, landing at the base of next tree on two feet. Standing behind tree and slowly looking around at the hogs. This continued for several minutes until they were about 30 yards apart and almost directly in front of me at about 40 yards. The animal dropped to all fours, bunched up its rear legs and leaped. It took two leaps to reach the hogs and it screamed during the second leap causing the hogs to panic for a split second. The second leap ended with it slapping one hog in its side, knocking it through the air into side of a tree. As the squealing hog bounced off the tree, it pounced on it, beating it with its fist like a person pounding on a desk. I could hear bones crunching with each hit. All this happened very fast. About 4 seconds from first leap to dead hog. The quickness of attack was very unnerving. The three live hogs were in full flight. The animal picked up the dead hog, tucked it under its arm and started walking off and let out a noise like (Grrrrrrrrrrr, whoop, whoop, whooooooop, whoop). It was immediately answered from about 200 to 300 yards out by a shorter (whoop, whoop, whoop ). After a couple more steps in the direction of the answer, it stopped, dropped the hog and turned to look past me. It turned back to my tree and raised its head to look at me. I have never been more afraid in my life. I tried to keep the scope on its head in case it came after me. It looked at me, cocked its head to one side. Its face had a curious expression as if studying me. It opened its mouth showing its teeth, letting out a soft (rrrrrrrrrr) sound. It then turned back to pick up the hog and walked off in no hurry as if I didn't exist. I was looking thru a 3 X 9 scope. Originally set on 3 power for the hunt but turned it up to 9 power after first trying to see object approaching from my right. After that time I was afraid to make the movement necessary to take scope off 9 power. I sat in tree stand for another 30 minutes or so, trying to calm myself. After concluding that if it wanted me, it would have already slapped me out of my tree stand. I got down and went to find my hunting partner, who was about a quarter to half mile away.

When I was about 16 which was in 1988 my friends and I always spent our weekends and breaks from school at my hunting camp on the Sabine River in Panola County TX. We would hunt and fish and live off the land mostly. One evening we had been fishing and had caught a lot of catfish so we cleaned our catch at our camp water well. It was an old type well with a hand pump. We built a fire and began to cook our fish. We had just finished eating when we heard a noise from where we cleaned our fish. We are used to having varmints such as racoons and oposums and coyotes come in to get the guts from the fish. Well I got my flash light and my 22 rifle and went to shoot whatever was getting the guts. When I was about 50 or so yards from the well I heard a moan not a growl but a moan. I could see a large dark mass at the well. I thought it was just several racoons in a wad eating. So I raised my light [and] when I did the large mass stood erect on two feet. I thought it was someone playing a trick on me. I immediately called to the person or what i thought to be a person. I told them I had a gun and was gonna use it. The thing didn't move or answer. I called again and said this aint funny I'm scared and gonna shoot. Now I stand six foot even and weigh 250 lbs. This thing was at least six foot five or taller and bigger than me. As I got closer my light exposed more of the thing. It began to move as I got closer it was covered in what looked like mud covered hair. I cant tell you the color because it was all matted up with mud just like pigs do to get rid of biting insects. Well the closer I got the more scared I got and I fired a couple of shots in the air to see if it was a joker they would tell me not to shoot. The thing ran off but not far I could hear its foot steps in the leaves it was then I walked back to tell my buddies and get help. None of them would go back with me to the well. The next day there were large five toed footprints at the well and all the guts were gone except the heads. My buddies all said I was playing a prank and made the tracks myself but I wear a size 13 shoe and these tracks were longer and wider than my shoe. I spend lots of time in the woods of East Texas and am as close to an expert as you can get on wildlife around here and I can tell you what I saw was an as yet unclassified animal.,On my hunting lease off County Road 430 in Panola County.,Panola County,Texas,Spring,"Report 10157: On Sabine River, young fisherman has late night encounter.",32.01083,-94.14306,1/18/2005,10157,Class A,9vtn1erhee,46.56,38.06,29.56,24.19,0.68,,0.3,0,0,,,Clear throughout the day.,0,,82,3.09
"I was driving home from town, to my parents house in southwest Parker County, when I came to the turn off to go down their road. I saw something big to the left of the road. It was dark brown or black and was standing up next to a tree.  It must have been 7 or 8 foot tall. It looked like it was eating leaves off a tree or something. As I drove up to the turnoff, it ran back (on 2 legs) into more trees, toward my parents home. I was afraid to get out of the car when I reached the house, thinking this thing could be right behind me. This memory has always haunted me. I do not lilke going down to my parents house at night any more, for fear something is living around that area.

"My girlfriend and I were parking at the edge of a creek flowing into the back of the lake. It was dark and under the cover of trees where we were parked you could not see your hand in front of your face. We had the windows cracked little and were in the back seat of the car when we heard something out of the ordinary. We had been there before so knew the usual night sounds in the area. A owl lived in the big tree near by and hooted all the time. The hill in front of the car went down to a swamp with a creek in the middle going to the lake. There was crickets, frogs and locust all making there normal sounds that night. But we heard something coming through the leaves in the bottoms, it sounded like it was heading to our car. I have spent a lot of time in the woods hunting, fishing and trapping growing up so I don't get spooked to easy. At first I thought it was a cow, but then we noticed all the night sounds were gone, no frogs, crickets, owl - dead quiet except the foot steps. They were on 2 feet a step and a drag step like it had a hurt foot or something. Then being a kid I thought of all the horror movies I watched and figured it was a guy who jumped the train and was coming to kill us and take our car. As the steps got closer I got really bugged, it was coming up the hill right at the car. Finally after what I thought was an eternity I flew over the front seat and started the car, the only problem was it was a new car she just bought and I never drove it. She was screaming about dieing or something when I threw it in reverse and stomped the gas. I was there before and new the road opened up behind me so as I was going backwards I hit the light switch. This was a big mistake because it turned out to be the cigarette lighter, as soon as we came out of the tree cover we got some moonlight and I found the headlight switch. This all happened really quick, but I looked up and there was this animal leaping over the hill going into the creek, it was really wide at the shoulders and had almost no neck. I thought at first it was a bear but there was not any bears in this area. I saw a big brownish black creature running through the trees. I saw two shoulders and the back of the head go between two trees, later measured to be about 4.5 feet apart. It covered between them easily. I asked my girlfriend did you see that, she said she saw a brown spot in the lights like a bear on two legs. I think the car scared it, so we went to town for help. After we got more people, truck's with lights and some equipment we came back. We left the truck lights shining in the bottoms and looked around for tracks with our flashlights. We started to look for footprints, the ground was dry and covered with leaves but we did find large scrapes going up the hill to where the car was parked, they looked like it was where the animal jumped over the hill. They were very far apart, I had to stretch as far as I could from the one on the bottom to the one at the top. I am 6' 4"" with a 38"" inseam, this was a large stride. This is when the whole woods went quiet again, it was nuts, 5 pretty big guys all standing in a circle like a herd of buffalo back to back, scared I guess, none of us moved a muscle. Flashlights and guns pointed out at the dark we listened to the dead quiet of the woods. Then all of a sudden a tree limb snaps - loud, and then everything gets back to normal. Then one by one the frogs, crickets, owls all started making noise again. Really strange night for sure. The next day my brother and a friend went to walk the creek with buckshot in our shotguns. We walked about a half mile down the creek spread out like small game hunting. We came to the area where the railroad tracks were up on the hill, my brother was at the bottom, I was in the middle, my friend was on the end farthest from the hill. Then we heard a lot of racket and looked over to my brother, he yelled my name in a really scared voice as something was going up over the hill. I remember seeing trees bending back as if being used to help something get up and over the top. When I got to where my brother was he was on one knee and had his gun pointed up at the hill. I said what was it and he said I DON'T KNOW, BUT IT WAS BIG. We found 2 marks on the really steep bank going up to the railroad tracks, I tried to climb it and could not. The marks were in the middle of the hill and at the top, something very strong and powerful went up the hill. It had a big stride also. The hill was about an 80% incline.",Near Sunshine Lake.,Parker County,Texas,Winter,"Report 9810: While parking near Sunshine Lake, teens have late night encounter",32.78611,-97.83334,11/20/2004,9810,Class A,9vf6t8xbvv,66.89,63.32,59.75,57.75,0.94,0.86,0.3,0.0063,1,rain,1015.49,Rain in the evening.,3,4.67,97,3.29

"I was towing my friend's car back to Midland TX. We were coming through the Davis Mt. area of SW Texas. The road was a two lane highway. I saw something on the side of the road that at first looked like a large cactus. I was driving about thirty-five mph. I hit my high beams and slowed down. When I turned on my brights I saw a very large head turn away. By then we were passing this thing. It looked to be about seven ft.tall. As we went by we all turned and looked at it, and it was looking at us as well. It had a very large head, large eyes and very long thick hair. The body was covered with thick, matted hair.

"This incident occurred in Texas about one year ago.  I know Texans are known for telling tall tales but so help me this is true. While driving down a country road about three miles southeast of Bryson, Texas around 10AM on a bright clear day I noticed what I first thought was large person crossing the road in front of me. I was driving around 30mph. It was about 50 yards in front of my truck. I came to a stop where I thought it had crossed. It crossed from south to north. North was to the left of my truck. I looked to see if I could recognize the person who crossed the road. I grew up in that area and know most of the people who live there. Standing about 50 ft. from my truck was some sort of creature. It was standing and facing me. The creature was about seven to eight feet tall. It had redish brown hair all over its body. You could also see its skin because the hair was thin. Its skin was very pinkish like it was sun burnt. Its hands and feet looked human like but they were very large. Its nose was wide but flat. Its lips were very thin. We looked at each other for a good five min. I had a gun in my truck but never thought of shooting this thing because it looked so human but also ape like. It finally turned and walked into the woods. I sat in my truck shocked at what I had seen. After a little while I got out to see if I could see any foot prints. I did not find any. The ground was too hard to leave any. This creature had to weigh at least 400 lbs. I have never said anything to anyone about this creature before. I didnt want people to think I am crazy but I know what I saw. It was not any animal I have seen in a zoo or anywhere else. We do not have bears in this part of Texas or no apes that I know of.","East of Bryson, Texas on a dirt road.",Jack County,Texas,Fall,Report 6941: Man has encounter at close range for several minutes.,33.13333,-98.35,10/21/2003,6941,Class A,9vfh3zxxwu,89.39,70.955,52.52,52.29,0.61,0,0.86,0,0,,1018.46,Clear throughout the day.,6,10,225,2.78
"Several Bigfoot were observed with binoculars in a deeply wooded area. They were dodging in/out of the tree line, like a game of cat and mouse, with each other. Thought it was a hoax being played on me and just watched them move closer in my direction. We also heard some cackling noises in the distance that I likened to hyenas or coyotes. Separate from these noises were dogs barking in the area. Horses in the area that became real jumpy. After walking into wooded area, we disturbed a large creature that let out a very deep and loud growl that I've never heard any animal make before and we heard a loud thud like a heavy animal jumping. Shots from a .45ACP handgun were fired in the vicinity followed by heavy footsteps and branches/brush being disturbed by the same heavy animal making a hasty retreat. We went into the same distance and reached a creek bed area. There was dead silence and we noticed some smudged prints near the water's edge but didn't hear a splash or any other noise. We got the feeling that we were being watched and feared that whatever we were following had doubled back on us and might corner us with our backs to the water. By this time, it was darker outside but in the more open areas you could see without a flashlight. As we were leaving the area, we heard very heavy footsteps and stomping along with tree branches crashing to the ground that I likened to a bull dozer without the engine rushing behind us. We got to a clearing and turned to face whatever it was and saw a HUGE, silver-grayish colored Bigfoot just at the tree line. It was in the 10 O'clock position from where we were and it was stomping and ""bluff charging"" or ""mock charging"" at us and throwing branches. The trees in this area were middle growth to mature trees and he (appeared to be male by the aggressive nature and sheer size...) was rattling these trees with no problem! We squatted down to get a better look and to take aim at him in case he charged. He stayed within the tree line and rocked back and forth like a gorilla. The only sounds that were heard, at this point, were the stomping and the branches being thrown at us. He was about 20 yds. away from us and the large branches were coming very close. I had the gun aimed right at him and I'm convinced that he had a better sighting on me than I had on him because he reacted just like a squirrel on a tree does. I was thinking about taking a shot at him when suddenly from the 12 O'clock position, we noticed another Bigfoot that was shorter than he was and wasn't as thick, up top, and appeared to be female because of (her) actions. The larger one(10 O'clock position) was at least 8 or 9 feet tall and was very massive in the shoulder areas. The smaller one(12 O'clock position) was at over 7 feet tall and was standing there rocking back and forth, but not as violently as the larger one. (seemed like she was following his lead and waiting to see what he would do next....) As long as I pointed the gun in their direction or shined a flashlight at them, they stayed behind the trees and tried to hide their faces. It became a sort of hide-n-seek as I shined the light to see their faces. I did catch a glimpse and the face appeared more sloth-like, from what I saw. They had BIG heads, the eyes were dark looking despite the growing darkness and flashlights. On one, I did notice a sort of frowned expression on the face and it almost looked sad. At this point, I couldn't shoot because I wasn't sure that it still wasn't a hoax, although I understood what I was looking at. Also, it almost seemed like they could almost understand things more than other animals. (I won't say they were thinking and reasoning.....) But, it was as if they were upset that I shot at them and was asking me ""WHY?"" The larger one (10 O'clock position) became more agitated and wanted us out of the area and began to stomp more and more, so we decided to slowly back out of the area (with gun pointed in their direction) and leave. As soon as we got out of the area, we then heard what I likened to a loud shouting type of horse whinnying shout. That I labeled their victory call, for running us out of the area. I had a camera hanging from my neck but didn't touch the camera until I got home and noticed it hanging from my neck! I was very much afraid and wasn't sure if I'd make it out of there alive or not.",,Hunt County,Texas,Winter,Report 7632: Bigfoots observed demonstrating intimidation behavior near Lake Tawakoni,32.94722,-96.10222,12/24/2003,7632,Class A,9vgemju7ry,58.99,49.495,40,28.17,0.57,0,0.05,0,0,,1021.47,Clear throughout the day.,3,10,131,1.93
"About 12:30 to 1:00am my wife and I was awakened by our neighbors dogs barking. At first we thought that maybe a skunk was in the area as we had the windows open and we smelled something that was rank. Our bedroom windows were open due to our AC unit not working. After about five minutes of this the dogs quit barking, and I decided to get up and use the rest room. Upon returning to the bedroom my wife asked me to get her a glass of ice water. I went down the hall into the dining room and turned to go into the kitchen when I noticed that a large head was looking in the kitchen window and was now looking at me. The distance from the hallway to kitchen window is about 20 feet. I have a ""Streetlight type"" security light in my backyard and it was on so I was able to see the creature clearly. The head was conical in shape and covered in a dark brown almost blackish hair about 4-5 inches in length. The face itself was basically hairless around the nose, cheeks and only a small amount of hair around the upper mouth. The jaw line was very powerful and large in shape much like the jaw line of a gorilla but more human like then a gorilla.  The creature had a large prominant eyebrow ridge that was covered with smaller length of hair. The skin color was a dark gray almost blackish in color.  The thing I remember most though was the eyes. The eyes were yellowish in color with large black iris's with no white that I could see. The color reminds me most of all like the eyes of a cat in color. I stood still and looked at the creature which was looking at me for about 30 seconds before I realized that the eyes and head was in the top section of the window and that I could not see the shoulders as they were outside of the window frame. But the head was large and muscular as was the neck and chest area that was visible to me. I would say that from my impression of this creature had to be at least 450 to 500 lbs in weight. This weight approximation is due to the overall impression of size and bulk of the creature I could see. I should note that the window is 26"" in length and I never did see below mid stomach area which was slightly large but not fat looking. I then became frightened when I realized that this creature was very powerful and a lot bigger then me. I'm 6 foot, 4 inches and about 250 lbs and in very good health and considered somewhat a large and strongly built man in the upper body. But I realized that this creature would make me look like a child if I was standing next to it. And if it wanted it could easily do bodily harm to me or anyone. I turned and ran into the bedroom closet and grabbed my SKS, then went to where I kept my ammo for the rifle.  My wife realized that I was scared and asked what was wrong.  She stated that I was white as a sheet as I was shaking from being so scared that I could not load the rifle. This I was trying to do in the light from the bathroom and I definitely did not want to turn on any more light until I had the rifle loaded, and ready. I finally got some rounds onto the bed for the rifle. and I told her that something was staring at me from the kitchen window and it was huge as I tried to load the SKS.  I finally put all ten bullets into the rifle before I went back into the dining room. I am still not sure that one, two or even three rounds even the hard hitting power from a military round such as a 7.62mm round of a SKS would stop it easily, short of a head shot. While I was loading the rifle we heard a loud weird howling sound come from the backyard which finally got me moving as I thought it would be coming in the house next. When I got back into the dining room I turned on all the lights both inside the house and the porch lights before I went outside. I will say that I WAS definitely intending to SHOOT the damn thing and deal with the problems from doing so later. It scared the hell out of me and I was afraid for my family. I have spent six years in the US Army, was in Special Forces and I am a combat veteran, (Panama and Gulf War).  When I went outside I could not see it anywhere around, so it had probably ran off by that time except that I had a feeling that I was being watched from the open field behind my house. I finally went back into the house and explained to my wife what I had seen.  After about five minutes from the time I went back into the house my neighbors dogs started barking again. Which made me a lot more nervous and edgy at first until my wife said that they stopped barking while it was outback. Anyway I spent a long night waiting for it to return but it never did. The next day I went outside to see if I could find any sign of the creature. I found that part of my barbed wire fence on the back of my property was pulled down about a foot in a place that might have been a scuff mark in the ground where it might have stepped as it went over the fence but nothing definite that would have stood up to any sort of official investigation. The fence height is five feet along that fence line. By then I realized that I had seen a bigfoot, sasquatch or what ever you want to call it. And should I ever see one again in my backyard I will try to shoot it as I did not feel safe then and I do not want one of them to get near my wife or kids. Some measurements on the window and back of house: I have measured the window in the kitchen and it is 32 inches wide and the top of the window is over eight feet off the ground outside, as the house is higher then the surrounding ground in the backyard. So if the creature was looking in at the top plane of glass in the kitchen window it was at least 8' 6"" in height and had a shoulder width of at least 36"" and more like 44"" by the width of shoulders that I could see and the extrapolation of the part of the shoulders I could not see. The weight I listed earlier is due to the fact that a creature that tall and broad and the depth it had to have since it seemed so powerful; must be at least the weight I listed as 450 to 500 pounds. I have not seen anything since that time and have taken a lot of kidding from my family and close friends that I or my wife have told this to but I still stand by what I saw that night and will do so until my dying day. AS I know what I saw and heard that night.","My home is about 150 yds off the north service road to Interstate 20, and is about 5 miles east of the nearest town.

"I was about 3 miles from the Sulphur River on family land. I walked down a creek bed to a pool on the other side. When I came back down the hill I stopped to relieve myself. Just as I started to step away I heard a high-pitched scream that startled me. A few seconds later it made the scream again. 25 yards in the thick woods I saw a slight movement. By a tree I saw a patch of dark brownish fur. Not sure what I was looking at, I held my ground and felt no fear. I was waiting for something normal to appear. I scanned the area but nothing else was moving. When I looked back to the patch of fur it was gone. Just when I was gonna shrug it off, I heard the scream again. This time it was behind me! As before, it screamed a second time. I spun around just in time to see it crouch behind a bush 20 yards from me. All I could see was the outline of a large head. It was moving around the bush trying to get a better look at me. About that time it occured to me - I didn't know what the hell this was.

"I was asleep on the couch and we have around 7 dogs. They started running around the house frantically barking and carrying on. We recently had a small fire that cleared out the back part of the woods back there and more and more people keep moving to this area. So I figured it was an animal or coyote or something they were chasing. I run a small security perimeter every night or so. There's always been a rumor of a panther up here, so I carry a weapon with me, not to mention snakes. I have never seen the panther but I have many times come up on something I assumed was the panther story but I never thought about a big foot theory till this morning. My wife woke up and made me go look. So I loaded my rifle and headed out on my security sweep. I first hit the road about 200-300m from the house, small dirt road. I don't use a flashlight, I can see fairly well at night. I have a brindle boxer who was freaking out sniffing the ground every 4-5 steps and just real jumpy, usually he just marks it and goes away. I saw no signs of the other dogs, when something jolted passed me out of the bushes almost knocking the boxer over, he ran the other direction. It scared the crap outta me and I got off 3 shots but missed it because my rifle jammed up with two shells in the chamber. I thought whatever it was I scared off, and used my pocket knife to release the two jammed shells. So I walked about 350m to my shop to grab some more ammo. I felt like the hairs on my neck were standing up. I loaded my rifle up and opened the door to my shop. Instantly I noticed this, pardon the expression, but this stout crap/wet grass odor really thick in the air. Not more than 5 minutes had passed and I felt like I was being watched again. I snuck around to my parent's house about 200m from my shop and climbed on the roof to get a better look. I was up high so could see lots more from there. We have a school bus on the property that we use for storage. It's about 350m NW of my location and I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me when I thought I saw a large thin shadow go past the bus. I figured it was my brindle boxer's shadow because there's a light on the shop. My house porch light creates a lighted area near there. But then it stop and looked right at me on my perch. I had it open sights but thought it was my dog with just a shadow. Then outta nowhere behind me the neighbor's dog started going crazy. I turned for two secs and the shadow was gone. My dog was behind me, not in front. I sat up there for another 10 minutes trying to find out what the neighbor's dogs were barking at. They were howling, growling, weirdest sounds too. They have a hound dog but it did not sound like that. It was really hard to describe the sound, almost like a howl but a growl at the same time. Very distinctive and then it all just stopped, a dead silence. I turned back to the bus area kinda just looking in the general area, trying to figure out what I saw, if it was just my imagination. Then I saw it again, plain as day. It was squatting down like it was hiding. It looked at me again and then ran around the side of the bus, it was as tall as the bus but skinny, but it was dark so not sure. I instantly jumped off the house and ran over there. The closer I got the more slower I went. Rifle held in a firing position as I crept around the bus. My heart pounded and when I got around the bus, nothing but the open area of where the fire had been. I am always suspicious of the land across the hwy, they have a fence around the property that is almost 9-10 ft high. They have many Exotic animals over there. A huge manmade water source. I think its a wildlife preserve or something, but nothing like this ever happened till it showed up. After this I am convinced it's not a panther. I have been running security every night or so. Bigfoot no idea, I am unsure what I saw, but it was intelligent. No matter what I think, I am absolutely sure, I was not the one hunting it. I don't think its intentions were harmful, it probably could have got to me at anytime. And I am not that easy to catch. It came back to the same place 3 times in one night even after I shot at it. I'm not sure but it's braver than me. Not the first time, just the first time I have seen it in the open. It seemed to me like it was testing defenses, probing to a point. It is either fast or there is more than one, because our homesteads are half a mile from each other. The neighbors and their dogs flipped out last night as well. I just know what I saw and it was not a coyote, wild pig or a panther.",,Hood County,Texas,Summer,Report 7552: Man has early morning encounter with unidentified creature,32.53333,-98.05,12/12/2003,7552,Class B,9vf30fd0mk,49.44,41.175,32.91,36.58,0.74,0.89,0.62,0.0037,1,rain,1014.21,"Light rain starting in the afternoon, continuing until evening.",2,7.27,114,1.92

My bathroom window looks out over my dog kennels. I don't turn on my lights while doing this because it obstructs my view. I thought I was seeing things.

"In 1988 my wife, fiancée at the time, and I were visiting my grandmother who was in her mid eighties at that time. She was living on some property that has been owned by my family for over half a century. She had spent a good portion of her life on this property. It was dusk and we were about to leave so we decided to sit on her porch before leaving. After sitting on the porch and talking for a while we heard a loud AHHHHHHHWW! It was coming from just inside the woods behind her house. I’m pretty familiar with animal sounds, but couldn’t identify this sound. I figured that since my grandmother lived there most of her life she would know what it was. I asked her about the sound and she said that she didn’t know, but she said that she takes all her scraps and garbage to the edge of the woods every evening and lately she had the feeling that she was being watched. She also told me she had started carrying a garden hoe when she went out there. In December of 1989 my friend and I went hunting on my family's property near Caddo Lake. It was about two hours before dawn and we settled into our deer stands. My deer stand was on the edge of a pipeline clearing. My friend’s stand was in a thinly wooded area overlooking a small clearing about a quarter mile away from mine. I sat in my stand freezing my butt off. I didn’t hear or see anything for almost an hour in the freezing temperatures. There was a full moon that night and it was pretty easy to see in the cleared areas. About an hour before the sun started to rise, I noticed something coming out of the woods. It began to walk down the opposite side of the pipeline clearing, towards me. It stayed in the shadows along the side of the wooded area it had exited. It was walking on two legs. At first I thought it maybe a hunter, but I looked hard to see if he had a gun and didn’t see one. This was private property a mile off the nearest road and I didn’t see a gun! It was also deer season, dark outside, and the woods are thick with trees, vines, and briars. This thing had just walked out of woods that are hard for me to walk through during the daytime without getting cutup from the briars. I couldn’t imagine any person strolling through these woods at night during deer season. At first it was probably 75 yards away but it was getting closer. I thought maybe I’m seeing things, but I decided to click the safety off on my gun just in case. Immediately after I had clicked off the safety, this thing heard it; it was barely audible to myself. I could tell it had turned my direction, because its shoulders were now turned towards me. Without missing a step it was now walking backwards while looking at me. After about four steps backwards, it quickly spun around and I couldn’t count the steps after that, it took a few more steps and quickly exited the pipeline. It entered the woods at a different location from where it had exited. I still couldn’t believe what I had seen, but I kept watching where it entered the woods in case it came back out. I noticed one large tree a few yards back in the wooded area that was higher than the other smaller trees around. This tree began to shake violently. After that I was done hunting, but was too scared to exit my stand. I was certain that it had to be Bigfoot. Every noise I heard after that spooked me. I stayed in my tree-stand until my friend came and got me after the sun came up. I told him what I had seen. I don’t know if he believed me but we went to look for tracks. We didn’t find any tracks but we saw a well-worn trail on the ground where it had exited the woods. I couldn’t enter this trail because the trees and briars were real thick. It looked as if small animals could only use this trail, as it was low to the ground. There was a freshly beaten path where it had reentered the woods. I was able to enter the where it had reentered. I noticed an old plastic pail hanging about five or six feet up on the tree that had been shook. I have no idea why this pail was there. Nothing was in it but pine straw. The woods were too thick from that point on and didn’t see where it could have gone from that point.",,Harrison County,Texas,Winter,Report 8107: Ongoing encounters with a bigfoot on family property at Caddo Lake,32.62194,-94.2,2/27/2004,8107,Class A,9vv186tssf,60.75,49.115,37.48,35.51,0.69,0.22,0.24,0,0,,1024.79,Partly cloudy until afternoon.,5,8.93,129,2.77

"On August 27, 2006, my wife Teresa and I were in the Davey Crockett National Forest about 4 or 5 miles south of Hwy 21.  We were looking into some new areas to hunt this upcoming deer season. We had left the truck at 7:30 a.m., we were both pleased with the weather conditions, because the sun was obscured by thick clouds and everything was wet from a recent rain shower.  However, it was very humid.  The vegetation was extremely thick, so visibility was not good at all. We left the main road and went down a small road that lead off to the left, which seemed the only passable way to go into the woods and thick cover.  All the way in we heard nothing, the woods were extremely still and quiet with no wind at all. The only thing we could hear was small insects. We made almost no sound ourselves, walking mostly on wet pine straw or wet leaf litter.  We walked in about 3/4 to 1 mile when the trail abruptly ended in a small clearing at which point we headed back. We were about 200 yards back up the trail when we heard a sound.  It was short but very clear.  The only thing close to it I've every heard was on some Bigfoot vocalizations I'd heard on the Internet.  I've spent my whole life in the woods throughout numerous states and never heard this before.  It was like a loud, but not excited, first a yelp ending in a peaceful descending howl.  This was done only twice, but one right after the other.  It was off slightly to our left, and at a guess, about 200 yards away. We are both interested in the Bigfoot theory (which we believe) and had heard of tree knocking.  So I picked up the nearest good size limb and began to strike a small tree.  I struck it about six to eight times.  Immediately, to our right at about the same distance we heard another very clear vocalization.  This time it was one clear moan, like the second half of what I already described.  It was two different animals.  It seemed as though the one was calling the other, and when I tree knocked the second one was saying ""that's not me, I'm over here'.  The whole event only lasted half a minute or so.

"Well to begin, my uncle which lives across the street from my parents heard his dogs barking so he got a flashlight and went out in his pasture to check it out. He shined his flashlight to an old vehicle he has in the pasture and saw eyes. He just stood there trying to figure out what it was then he saw it turn and run. He said he beat the dogs back to the house it scared him bad. Well he called my parents telling them about it. They laughed at him and asked him if he had been drinking - he said no, it ran towards y'all. Well my dad went outside to see if he could see anything and he didn't find anything.

She said, ""He wasn't lying, that thing is out there."" My dad ran to the porch to see what it was but by that time it had already ran off. I asked my mom what it looked like after I finally calmed her down she said it was about 7 1/2 to 8 feet tall standing there kind of slumped over with his arms dangling, staring at her.

"Recently my son went outside just after dark.  He ran back in telling me there was something out side making a strange noise.  I went outside thinking I was going to hear the nearby bulls, dogs, or even a coyote.   What I heard was the strangest sound I had ever heard.  We stood there for quite a while trying to figure out what it could be until my five year old started crying saying he was scared. Today I listened to several video [audio] clips of the Sasquatch Whoop Howl.  That is the EXACT sound I heard.  I got chills when I heard these recordings. I then looked up sightings in Texas to see if it were possible that there could be any in my area.  I was shocked to discover that there had been sightings very close to my house in Newton County on the Sabine River.  I even found where there had been a sighting in Buna, which is where I live, in the 1980's.  I live in a wooded area.  The woods behind me, over 500 acres, have been untouched for over a hundred years.  It has just recently been sold and timber starting to be cut in the area.  I am wondering if this is stirring it up?  Please let me know if you think it could be possible that what I heard is real.  I know that is the sound I heard.

"I [work] in Jasper County, Texas. On Thursday August 4, 2005, [in the early evening] I was walking [outdoors on company property surrounded by the Big Thicket]. There was some rustling in the underbrush about thirty yards off to the left side of the dirt road which I was travelling down. Shortly after hearing the rustling I began to smell what seemed like a mixture of a skunk and strong coffee mixed with kind of like a dead fish smell. At first I thought that it might have been some wild hogs bedding down for the evening, so I stopped to listen for anything that might have indicated piglets since wild sows are dangerous if they are protecting their young. After about thirty to forty-five seconds, the rustling around stopped. I couldn't see into the brush, but I felt like whatever was in there was watching me.  Not wanting to be the focus of a hog charge, I hollered in hopes that I would scare off whatever it was in the brush.  After not getting any response, I figured that whatever it was had left, so I resumed [what I was doing]. I had to go down to a gate and turn around. When I passed the spot where I had my encounter, I heard a whoo--whoo--whooping sound coming from behind me. It was quiet at first then it got louder as I got farther away. I was puzzled as to what could make that sound. I am an experienced deerhunter, and I have never heard that sound before. It sounded kind of like a howler monkey. In fact that's what I would have thought that it was if I didn't know any better. About two and a half hours later [at a different location] I smelled the same smell.

"My wife and I were out on the Brazos River with some friends. We were fishing and swimming on a sand bar in the Goatneck bend of the river. A member of our party noticed someone moving around on a rock ledge up on the cliffs about 250-300 feet above the river. They were about 1/2 mile away from us. As we started watching, whatever it was started jumping around, waving its arms like it was trying to get our attention. It did get our attention. It was jumping around like it was playing.

"I was riding in the car with my friend, she was driving. It was the opening weekend of deer season, full moon, very bright. We were on a one lane gravel road in the Direct Bottoms. We saw less than 100 feet away from us a creature cross the road from left side of road to right. It was 7 to 8 feet tall, with long gray hair. It walked right in front of us. Its arms were longer than a man's, swinging them as it walked. It stepped right over a barbed-wire fence. A mile down the road, we turned around and got stuck in a wheat field. We were stuck 30 minutes. After we got the car unstuck, we went back the same way as we came in. We were scared that we would encounter the creature, but there was no sign of it.

"Hello, I was talking to my wife, who lived in Mexico City at the time, by cell phone. This happened about a year and a half ago. I drove from my house about 2 miles up the road. I live on farm land so the neighbors are far away from each other. I got to a hill where the road goes left and right. I stopped the car and had the motor turned off. Right before I hung up I heard a yell coming from the woods that were to my right. I told my wife, who is a vetenarian what I heard. She laughed a little and we said good bye. Before I turned the key I heard it again but it was getting really close. Im talking about 200 feet.I did not want to find out what was there so I turned around and came home. I got on the internet that day and found a site that describes different animal sounds. A coyote, a donkey and a bear. The next sound was that of a bigfoot. It matched perfectly. I live about 20 miles south southeast of a town called Seguin. I went back listening the next day and several times after that. I have not heard it again and  I really dont care to.

"This day I did not get in my deer stand, I took a chair and got in the woods (not sure how many yards in the brush). The weather was bad and I had no business there. After ten minutes or so of sitting on the spot waiting for deer or hogs I heard at aprox. 20 yards a real loud scream I mean loud. I became concerned since I was by myself and this is a private property far from any houses. I walked out of the woods and as soon as I made it to the right of way I heard something walking toward me and it sounded heavy breaking limbs as it came. I moved away from the edge of the woods, raised my 30/30 and got ready to confront whatever it was. This thing never came out but it was looking at me because I could hear the very heavy breathing just standing in the brush. It was already getting dark. I decided to get back to my truck parked about 1/4 of a mile down. Still holding the rifle, I got to the dirt road just on the other side of the right of way and walked as fast as I could to the truck. I did not run because I am a hunter and know the nature of wild things and dont want to be chased. As I walked toward the truck I could still hear this thing walking right along with me, but it would never come out. The dirt road makes a right and this is when I was scared the most because I could no longer hear or see that area. Anyway I made it to the truck (thank God) and got out of there as fast as I could.

"I was driving from Windom. It was after midnight. I had the high beams on as you never meet another car at that time of night.

I was traveling pretty fast so I reached where it had crossed within a second or two and it was gone. It had disappeared into a cluster of cedar trees that were along the fence line. I have only told a couple of people about it. At the time I didn't think about it being a big foot because I have never heard of any in the area.

"I was on my way to Gatesville traveling south on US281 south of Stephenville when I topped a hill and noticed something at the edge of my high beams crossing the road. It appeared to be a large man possibly a hitch hiker but as I got closer it turned towards the truck continuing to walk in the bar ditch. This thing was approximately 8' tall and covered in long hair. It appeared to have long hippie like hair and somewhat of a beard. From what I could see this thing was very big as all I could see was from the thigh up and it still towered over the top of my truck. As I got closer the one thing that really got my attention was the eyes. They appeared a yellowish green and only slightly shined. The nose wasn't like a pig’s nose but more human with flaired nostrals and the face seemed very humanlike in its expression. It had a very large upper body and chest. It appeared to have no neck as the deltoid muscles kinda flowed into the head. As I passed I checked my rearview and could see it turn into the brush. I checked my brakes and started to turn around but then thought what am I doing, thinking my eyes and the early hour of the morning were playing tricks on me and continued on to Gatesville. The rest of the way to Gatesville I kept trying to figure out what I had seen. Was it a man, hitch hiker, transient, or animal. I tryed to put it out of my mind but could quite not let it go. I told my wife only after 3 or 4 years had passed and I got that look so I never told anyone else until I found this website and found how many other people have had similar experiences.",Leon River basin.,Erath County,Texas,Fall,Report 11260: Early morning road cross encounter south of Stephenville.,32.04417,-98.09234,3/19/2005,11260,Class A,9vdnrc7qff,68.47,57.21,45.95,39.71,0.52,0.02,0.31,0,0,,,Mostly cloudy overnight.,8,10,80,2.61
"Approximately two weeks ago we had a very unusual incident take place in our area. Of course, it is hunting season so there are incidence of wild animals coming into our area. Most times we can identify the animals, even if they turn out to be refugees from an exotic animal ranch. On this night, sometime around midnight, I heard a strange sound at the other end of the house. At the same time, our dog bounced off the bed and began barking towards our kitchen. I was home alone so I went armed in search of the intruder. The door was locked and there was no intruder in the house. On my way back throught the house, our dog began barking viciously at the back door. She was bouncing up and hitting the back door with her chest. She is very protective. She was very aggressive but I refused to let her out of the house. As I pulled her away from the door, this awful stench hit me. I can only say that the smell was a cross between swamp mud and musk. I drug the dog to the bedroom to try and quiet her down. The doors and windows were closed, but the odor managed to fill the room. I knew that what ever the animal was, it had to be fairly good-sized. When my wife came home, I told her about the incident but she did the eye roll thing and plopped down to watch tv. I was still curious about the smell so I opened the back door. Just as I got the door open, this ""thing"" screamed an ungodly scream. Not sure if my wife heard it, I turned to ask her if she had. The second scream came and I didn't have to ask, my wife had turned sheet white. Needless to say, I slammed the door shut. I do know that the ""thing"" was northwest of our house. I thought I might find tracks but the ground was too dry. I do know that the ""thing"" upset every dog in the area and they stayed stirred up for several days. I did mentioned the ""incident"" to a relative who is an avid hunter and outdoorsman and asked if he knew what it might have been but he said no. I wanted to make sure because I had another idea. Several years ago, I watched a documentary about Big Foot. In the film, they played a sound that they swear is a big foot yelling. However, non-big foot believers say the sound came from a wounded moose, not big foot, and they gave a long speel and some outrageous example. Okay, that was the sound I heard twice to a ""T"" and we don't have any wounded moose in this part of Texas, so what the hell was it?

"I live near the Comal and Hays county line in Texas. This is hill country right on the Devil's Backbone.  This area has lots of heavy oak and juniper with several spring fed rivers; Guadalupe with Canyon Lake near and the Blanco just to the north. September 2012 on a weekend I was enjoying a moonless night packed with stars. I began to hear dogs barking in the distance to the west. More local dogs started barking. I was expecting to hear the coyotes to chime in as they often do on the hill behind my place. Instead my two 100+lb boxer/labs started going nuts. They would not leave the porch to go into the woods as they often do chasing pigs, coyotes or the neighbor's bull.  I had been out on the driveway and went up on the porch. I stood there and tried to get the dogs to go after whatever it was. I tell you the wind was out of the south. Reason being, as I stepped around the corner of the house something big let out a holler, I can not explain. I think it smelled me then. It was close, probably within 20 yards?  Just past where I have cleared all the trees .  The holler, yell was so strong it felt like it shook my insides. Vibrated.  Everything went stone quiet. All the neighboring dogs and mine went totally silent.their hair on their backs was raised and they were locked on something down hill.  Then off to my right, heading up a tight valley I heard wild pigs grunting and then the sound of a couple raccoons?  I couldn't, understand why they would be together?  Then after a few short minutes the dogs up hill started going nuts and then beyond. Like something was moving fast and the dogs were picking up on it.  I told my dogs to go on down the hill into the woods, they did no problem.

"I feel stupid doing this but my teacher told us in class the other day about his bigfoot experiences. I don't want to attempt to tell the whole story but you people should really talk to him. I respect him alot and he told us that he has encountered a ""creature"" at least 6 times in his life time in or near the vicinity of a bridge called the ""1893 bridge"" in Cooke County, Texas. It's located north east of Callisburg on Survey Road. He told us that they have seen it in the light of their headlights. He said it stood at least 8 maybe 9 foot tall and that it could step over a fenceline. On one occasion he told us the creature was bouncing a limb up and down with its arms one night in the light of their headlights and they measured the height of the limb the next day and he said he couldn't even reach the limb. On several occasions there was more than one person in the vehicle with him. Several times he had people go with him during the day time to look for tracks and stuff and he said that they found bones in the bottom of this creek where they had seen the creature during the night time. He claims that his buddies have taken shots at the creature  but it never had any effect (he didnt know if they hit it). I hope this can be of some use to you.

"I was 14 years old in 1976. It was either Nov or Dec 1976 and I had rode my dirt bike to what is known in Cooke County, Texas as the Old Toll Bridge located at the Red River. At the river stands 3 old piers that supported the bridge back in the 20's or 30's. I was standing by the edge of the river looking at the ice float by when I heard what sounded like to me as Coon dogs hot on the trail of something across the river on the Oklahoma side. As I looked across I saw a dark hairy animal, or something, running on two legs like a human. There was a dead tree log that this large animal jumped over. The coon dogs jumped across the log after it. As I watched in amazement I heard the lead dog let out a loud yelp. The 2nd dog came running back and jumped over the log back into the direction that they originally came from. The first dog never came back nor made another sound. At 14 years old it scared the hell out of me so I ran and jumped on my motorcycle and took off home. I told everyone at the house of what I saw and everyone laughed at me. I hade been back there several times after that but never seen or heard anything. The Old Toll Bridge Road is now closed off. I know what I saw and it wasn't human nor a bear. It was a Big Foot. Next was in the late summer of 1978 and my friend and I had just returned from cruising the drag in town. We had went back to his parents house out by the Girls State School in Gainesville, TX. When we go there his parents, brothers and sister where all in the back yard not talking. We asked them what was going on and his Dad said just to listen. We said what for. He said that they had heard some kind of wild animal growl coming from creek bottom out in Mr. Leowold's pasture. We set there for a while and they went in. I was talking to my friend when we heard a load roaring growl. Like a four wheel drive truck locking up the tires on the highway. Just then it did it again. We ran inside and told his parents. They said just to leave it alone. We went and snuck out our 22 rifles and jumped in the truck to drive down to where the creek went under the bridge just east of state school. As we were listening we heard bird chirping then flying off out of their roost. Then limbs breaking and rocks being knocked around on the creek bed. We decided to get out of there and left ASAP. The next day we went back over to where we had access to get to the creek by the highway. David and myself walked the creek when we came across a barefoot foot print that was much larger than any grown man.

"I was hunting on our private land near Gatesville, Texas. It was very cold and very early in the morning at around 4 a.m. When we arrived at the gates to our property me and my stepfather exited our vehicle and applied a last coat of scent blocker from our heads to our toes then applied raccoon urine to the soles of our boots. We entered our property and began walking through the first 40-acre field. At the far side of the field my stepfather settled into his hunting blind, leaving me to continue on to my hunting spot alone. It was about another 3/4 or 1 mile past my step dads hunting blind to my hunting spot. I walked mostly by memory of the trails of our land using my flashlight only when I absolutely had to, which was a maximum of 5 times and for a only a few seconds each time. I reached my hunting spot by about 430 or 445 a.m. I settled into my usual hunting spot at the base of what we call the East Hill. I remember that I picked that spot because the wind that day was blowing to the east/south-east and the deer generally walked out north of that spot. It had a excellent sight line down the left side of the creek on our property (which I believe was north) under a large tree with lots of brush grown in front of it. There was no moon that night. It was around 5 to 5:15 in the morning, but still so dark that I could not see my hand in front of my face. After being there for 15-20 minutes I began noticing the sound of footsteps coming from my right down the hill. Even though they sounded very far off, the distinct heavy and slow footsteps made me to wonder what it was. It definitely sounded like it was walking on 2 legs.  It could not have been a horse or cow and no goat was heavy enough to produce the foot sounds that I heard. Bear have never been spotted anywhere in this region so it didn't take long for the frightening realization to set into to me that this might be a bigfoot. I fully cocked my 30-30 rifle and pointed it in the direction of the footsteps.  It still sounded like it may have been as much as 15 yards away but was steadily moving in my direction with pauses every so often for up to a minute. One pause was so long that I had thought it had snuck off, but suddenly its distance to me had jumped from 10 or 12 yards away to about 5 yards away.  I later discovered that there was a very large flat rock breaking the surface of the ground about 10 yards from me in that direction. I was becoming extremely nervous at this point but the sounds still moved closer. I began to hear heavy breath sounds from the animal as it was getting closer. It sounded labored or very deep with a heavy exhale. I estimate that it was 10 feet from me or so when it took one last step. It then seemed as if it finally realized I was there, because it turned so quickly to leave that it tripped or slipped. It sounded like it fell down and hit the ground hard with a thud, then scrambled to get up.  It ran away with what sounded like a long heavy stride which faded away quickly in the distance in the same direction it came from. I waited till daylight to go looking for evidence. The only evidence I found was what appeared to be the spot were it fell on the ground. The distance from my hunting spot to the spot where I believed it fell and came out to be 11 feet. I hunted for about 1 hour after that but couldn’t stand to be in the area any longer. Also, there was not 1 single animal in the area, not even the squirrels that usually run free along the trees near the creek during that time of year.",,Coryell County,Texas,Winter,Report 15696: Possible stalking of hunter near Gatesville,31.37756,-97.59946,12/1/2004,15696,Class B,9vdde045x9,57.38,46.025,34.67,31.45,0.69,0.03,0.65,0,0,,1025.93,Clear throughout the day.,4,9.66,176,4.28
"I live in Northeast Texas close to the town of Commerce. I was witness to several incidents when I lived just outside Commerce. At the time I was employed for the Delta County Sheriffs Dept as a deputy. It was around 1990 and a friend and I were in the business of buying dairy calves to raise and resell. My friend lived in an area close to the town of Horton. The actual town is now under water - part of Cooper Lake. This was a very remote area of dense thick woods running all the way to Sulphur Springs. My friend began finding his calves dead at the barn. It appeared that their necks had been broken. This all came to a head on an evening as he heard his boar hog squealing loudly from the pen. The pen was located at the edge of the woods. My friend had a very mean boar hog that weighed around 400lbs. He called me on the phone and told me to come as fast as I could. When I arrived he was almost in shock and told me that he went and grabbed his rifle and went to the barn. He said that he saw a very tall hairy creature lifting this boar hog over the pallet fence. My friend fired a shot at it and it dropped the hog and ran off. My father and I went to the pen and found a set of tracks. These resembled a very large human foot in the dirt. My father - a retired Dallas police officer, contacted my friend's neighbor. The neighbor was also a retired police officer and professor at Northeast Texas Community College. He came and called a couple of his students and plaster casts were made of the print. Several pics were taken of the cast and one was even printed in the local paper. The cast went on display at the college in the science dept. I have the cast. At this time I am still trying to find where it was stored to get the dimensions for you. As we were talking with my friend's neighbor, he advised that he oversaw a cabin across from him (bordering my friend's land) way back in the woods. The owner had said that strange things were happening at this place. We saw that the tracks went due east toward this other piece of property. We went to the cabin and saw several more of the footprints going in a circle around the cabin. Over time we saw and measured two other sets of tracks. The only size I remember was 12 inches. The other tracks were bigger than the set we cast. The strange happenings always started in the spring and continued until the late fall. His property is about 2 miles from the Horton bottoms where I know several people who have seen this creature but would not go public for fear of being thought crazy. One was chased out of the bottoms while duck hunting at a slew (see ). I have since moved to a different part of the county. About eight years ago a friend and I were walking along the Sulphur River and found tracks going to the water as if to get something to drink. As I said I am still looking for the cast as my dad put it into storage. As soon as it is found I would be glad to send a pic to you. In the cast you can clearly see the tissue ridges on the bottom of the toes - much like ours. I am curious if anyone has ever reported anything like this in this area. I have nothing to gain from telling this story. I have been a law enforcement officer in this area for 13 years. At first I told a couple of people of what I had seen and most thought I was crazy.

"I was born in 1936 and grew up on a farm in Delta County, while working in the field we would see what we referred to as the nude woman.  It was a large animal walking upright along the edge of woods and never coming completely out in the open. I left in 1954 to serve my Country for 23 years and returning to same area that I grew up in. Sometime in the mid 1980's after a heavy rain with flooding, my baby brother found footprints where this animal had departed the water and walked around in the mud.  In the early 1990's my Mom and Dad were traveling down TX 71 in Delta County and just before crossing the South Sulphur River a large man like animal walked across the road in front of them and stepping across fence and heading north. Again in the 1990's my son-in-law and myself had a couple of encounters with a large animal walking through trees in waist deep water while we were duck hunting in what is now Cooper Lake.

"I live in Frisco Texas, and me a friend go kayaking at the greenbelt quite often, Denton county, it connects lakes Lewisville and lake Rayroberts together, We started kayking and probably went about 2 miles when we came upon a log jam we could not get around. So we had to get off the water and go around it on the shore.

"Our daughter told us this at Christmas following the event in October of 2001. She had been afraid of ridicule and did not mention it until we decided we needed to tell her about its existence. We had become acutely aware of its passing through our area due to its screams which could be heard several nights in a row in the creek (Caney) bottom below our house (about 3/4 mile). I had been aware of the screaming since I moved to this location in the winter of 85/86. Local residents had spoken of a ""wild man"" that jumped fences and made loud yells but I assumed that if the stories were true, they were referring to some mentally ill human. It was years later that I became aware that there were sasquatch-type creatures along the Red River. In September of 2000 my wife and I found some extremely unusual rock formations in the Kiamichi Mountains of Oklahoma and in the course of our investigations were told of 6 bigfoots that lived in the area by a 98 year old resident. When we arrived home around 9:30 pm that night we heard the screaming down in the creek bottom and all the livestock, dogs and cats in the vicinity were agitated for days afterward. We heard the screams even after sunrise the following day. We did not mention this to our daughter because she worked a night shift in Sherman and returned home between 2 and 3 am. During a series of nights in the fall of 2001 my wife became so anxious that she finally decided to tell our daughter so that she would get into the house quickly at night. By Christmas, though, our daughter had moved to Sherman and would not even come back to get her clothes. That's when she finally told us what she had seen. As she drove up the one lane gravel road that connects the new highway to where we live, it ran a few yards in front of her headlights, running very fast upright from the west to the east. This is an open cow pasture on the west bounded by a barbed wire fence about chest high. On the east side of the road was a maize field and an abandoned house about 200 yards further. My wife pressed her for details but all she said was ""It looked like that thing from Harry and the Hendersons"". She doesn't like to talk about the incident because her friends in town make fun of it. After this incident early in 2002, my wife and I found a coyote completely stripped of flesh except for the paws. It was very fresh and the bones were still ""wet""; that is they were not dried and discolored to white. I cannot positively say what did that but I've lost 14 dogs since I've lived here and I have never found any traces of their bodies or bones. Then around June of this year I went into the fallow field behind my house to dig for some very old stone artifacts I've been finding for two years on a low mound above the creek. There in the yellow clay was a very large human looking footprint between 14 and 16 inches long on the side of a trench I had excavated about 3 feet deep. I noticed a swarm of flies boiling around something on the opposite side of the trench from the footprint. It turned out to be a square piece of white meat about two inches square and 1/4 inch thick. One of the edges had coarse hair like a coyote's. I brought my wife back and showed her the track and the meat. She thought we ought to make a cast of the track but I told her it was pointless as no amount of casts would ever convince anyone of anything. Besides, I was not interested in convincing anyone of the thing's existence; those who are involved don't need to be convinced and those who need convincing aren't involved. We have seen ""nests"" in the tall grass behind the house and under the big pecan tree in front of the house. They could be some other large animal bedding down but there are not many animals that big around here since we stopped pasturing cattle a couple of years ago. I have suddenly smelled a strong skunk like odor when I've been digging at my site but we have a lot of skunks around here. On two occasions I've found stone artifacts lying on top of soil I've removed from my excavation the next day as if they had been left there for me. At the suggestion of a bigfoot hunter from Sulphur, Oklahoma, I left a small hand mirror and some dried fruit in a plastic bag at my dig site, but nothing ever disturbed them. Likewise I leave all the natural flakes and pebbles I dig up in small piles but I've never found them disturbed either. Many times as I am digging I have a strong sense of something watching me from the treeline on the creek below but I've never seen anything to confirm that.",,Fannin County,Texas,Fall,Report 7567: Family experiences activity near Ector.,33.59,-96.27306,12/15/2003,7567,Class B,9vgx16b5gj,68.82,53.685,38.55,42.22,0.65,0.24,0.72,0.0098,0.81,rain,,Breezy until afternoon and rain starting in the evening.,3,9.31,190,14.13
"In October 2000, I began hunting on my wife's family land.The land had sat idle for at least ten years. When I began hunting the land, the deer and hog population was quite high. I took quite a few animals with nothing out of the ordinary taking place. Oct 2001: I started filling my feeders and noticed deer every time I entered the property.Strange things started to take place on the first day of season. At the time I didn't think much about it. On opening day, (evening) I was hunting in my stand that was closest to the creek.(I would later find this was close to the bigfoot's nest area). My dad and I had been whispering at my stand. He left to walk to his stand (100 yards off). Shortly after he left, all wildlife sounds stopped. I then heard a large tree crash to my right (north). I then heard what sounded like a buck hitting his horns (scraping) on a tree. The animal then made a loud blowing noise.I didn't think this unusual. I then heard an animal moving through the dense trees(going from north to south to my dad's stand) I never saw it. It went in the direction of my dad's stand. At one point, it turned and started back in my direction. It then ran out of the woods(going east) to the fire road. At no point did I ever see what the animal was. My dad said that he heard it come up behind him. It then turned and went back in my direction. All season, there was an eerie feeling felt by all that hunted the place. There are two roads running through the place. Both travel north/south and cross a dry creek. All strange activity would happen across the creek between the two roads.Squirrels would start barking on the creek and then complete silence. Later in the season, my wife was hunting with me. I left her in her stand (on the 1st road) and I walked down and crossed the creek to hunt. When I arrived to get her (dusk), she was in shock and crying. She said that something big had walked up close behind her. She turned to see what it was and the animal fled. She said it moved to her right and crossed the road. She heard it run and jump the small creek. After it landed on the other side, it growled at her. She also stated that it had a horrible smell. I had never mentioned anything to her about bigfoot (smell sounds).It is my belief that this is what she had contact with. The last week of deer season, my dad and I were hunting off the second road. We had got in the woods late, so I walked in about 30 feet (off the road) and sat on a stump. About 75 yards down, I heard a squirrel barking in a very strange way. I then heard three large tree breaks. Shortly after, I heard movement to my left in the thicket. Within a few minutes, I heard strange noises coming from the road behind me. Within a few seconds I heard very heavy footsteps on the road. The road is soft silt (water runoff). Part of it was exposed dirt, part covered in dry leaves.The footsteps were in the dry leaves. I turned to see a large red creature walking on two legs. I couldn't see the entire animal at one time due to the trees along the road. I would estimate the animal at seven feet tall, long thick arms, thick chest, long red hair (the color of an Irish Setter dog). It appeared to be a large ape. The animal was in no hurry and I assume, had no idea I was sitting there. I stood up and turned to face the animal. I leveled my shotgun at it (for protection), and called my dad on the walkie talkie. As soon as I spoke, the animal let out a low short scream and broke into a run down the road.I have never seen an animal move that fast. I'm quite sure that it never saw me,as I scared it by speaking. My dad arrived and I told him what had taken place. We looked on the road and found two sixteen inch long foot prints in the soft silt. My dad advised that he heard the animal come through the thicket between us, but didn't see anything. At the time, I was a member of the Texas Bigfoot Research Center. I called and reported the incident. The next day, myself and several members searched the area. Across the creek (from one of my stands), an area was located that appeared to be a bedding area. An old 16 inch track was found in the bedding area. The next summer, I was taking a TBRC member to the bedding area when we came across a nest constructed of tree limbs. It was constructed on the north side of the tree. Several limbs (north side only) were broken off the ceder tree and laid aginst it in an ""A"" frame type leanto. There were additional branches that had to have come from other trees. The ""nest"" was about 4 feet tall. It did not show to have recent usage (winter nest?) About eight feet away,another ceder tree showed to have branches broken down touching the ground. This tree showed recent usage under the tree. Both trees were within fifty feet of the first bedding area found after my sighting. No one has access to this part of the place. It is very remote. 2002: Again a strange feeling was felt by all that hunted on the place.It seemed as long as we (hunted off the first road) did not cross the creek we were not bothered. Anytime we hunted off the second road we had unusual things happen(vocal,trees breaking). My wife and I crossed the creek and hunted from a fire road overlooking a creek. Weeks later, we came back to hunt the same spot. We had hunted in a stand of 3 trees together. When we came back, there was a ceder tree (pulled up roots and all) that had been thrown into the trees we had been hunting. The oddest thing about it is this area is nothing but hardwoods. The ceder tree was pulled up from somewhere else. This again, was within a short distance from the nest area. The last week of season, my wife, friend, his young son, and I were hunting the 1st road. My wife, the boy, and I crossed the creek to hunt. My friend took one of my stands. We left the boy on the road where I could watch him. the wife and I  walked in about 50 yards and sat on the creek. About 30 minutes before dusk, a loud, low roar was heard down the creek (between the 2 roads). It was so loud it just seemed to vibrate my chest. Something was heard walking around but couldn't be seen. It scared the boy so bad he got up and moved. Not seeing him, I got up to go find him. At this point, we decided to end the hunt. 2003: A friend and I went to the property to plant green patches for the deer to eat. I decided to cross the creek and plant one near where I had a feeder. This feeder is a gravity feeder made from PVC pipe. It has a large Y pipe on the bottom (held to the tree by a rubber bungie on the bottom and rope on the top). We found the lower Y pipe had been removed. No damage was done to the feeder. It was if the pipe had been twisted enough to break the glue. The rubber bungie was hung on a tree limb (7 feet off the ground) by the hook. Several old tracks were found behind the tree.They had been stepped in several times. There was no way to tell the length of them. What could be seen, indicated the size around 16 inches.The missing section of pipe was located about 50 feet away in some ceders. The camo paint had been scratched off in long straight lines. As would be seen if someone used their fingernails. I had taken a camcorder with me, and recorded what was found. All during deer season, one of my bucket feeders was constantly being taken apart. The bottom was being unscrewed, and the parts found scattered down the creek.This is a free hanging feeder.It takes two people to screw the bottom on (very tight). Opening weekend, another track was found on the second road where I had my sighting (seen by two other people). My friend, his son, and I hunted the second road by the creek. After coming out that evening, they both said they heard tree branches being broken after they returned to the truck. I was inside the truck and didn't hear anything. Nothing else occured this season. We inspected the nest and the area around it. No other signs were seen. My friend suggested that he didn't have that strange feeling out there anymore. It could be that after four years the creature moved on. The game population has been depleted/scarce with the arrival of this animal. Since its arrival, only one animal has been harvested in three years.

What really caught my eye was that it had a really big head covered with long bushy hair. I'd been driving about 20 mph before I saw it, but as soon as I saw it, I slowed down to maybe 5 mph. At this time, it stood up on it's hind legs and looked directly at me and growled at me as if it were a wolfman like in the old 50's movies.Then it ran on its hind legs like a human being, but faster than anything I've ever seen in my life; across the road in front of me, and into a tree line.

"I do not know the exact year. It must have been spring or early summer. A storm was coming in and it was at night. Our landlord kept two old horses on the pasture. Somehow they had gotten out and my father and his friend were trying to find them. They had drove off in my dad's jeep (toward the tree of Lebenon). I was standing on the front porch watching them drive off when I felt something eerie, I guess. I turned toward the pasture and there was this tall, lean, lanky, hairy mannish thing coming toward me. I called quietly to my younger sister because I was terrified. It's eyes never left mine even when my sister came onto the porch. I could not speak or breathe but my sister was making a whimpering noise, it still held my gaze. It came to the fence and put it's hand onto the top. I was awestruck that the lower part of his chest was the same height as the top of the iron fence. The fence is at least four to five feet tall. He towered over it. My dad was returning down the road and the headlights of the jeep drew me out of my fixation. I glanced at the jeep for only a second and when I turned back, the creature was half way down the pasture in one second, then disappeared into thin air. When my father came back home after finding the horses I questioned him on if he saw anything and he did not. My younger sisters were both crying and my dad was angry saying I was frightening them on purpose. I am shaking now just remembering about it's eyes. I was never supposed to speak about it again after many lectures from my father. I lived in that house until 1996, all through my high school years. After that incident, not sure how long after, I felt something watching me in my bedroom to a point that it drew me to the window. I could not see it clearly but along the tree line on by the far fence it was there watching me, I could make out it's massive shadow but could not make out its features. I shut my shades and went into another room, for I was not to talk of such nonsense. I never went out at night by myself again.

"I have never spoken to anyone about this incident and really don't care who believes me or not! A long time has passed since my encounter and I don't remember much about the events leading up to and after the incident, however, I can still hear and feel fear when I remember the specific encounter. I was enjoying a weekend on Lake Texoma, Texas with my family, outside of Mill Creek Marina, near Pottsboro Texas. Fourth of July weekend and we had several family members enjoying the weekend with us on the boat dock. As night fell we could not wait to watch fireworks pop into the night sky over the water, we had also purchased a large number of fireworks and were disappointed when we were told we could not pop them off near the dock. So we decided to take a small dingy over to the other side of the lake, which is next to an unpopulated area of woods directly across from our dock, about two-hundred yards away. We figured if we could row over to the isolated beach we could pop them off without incident and our family could see them in the air. My son and I rowed over to the beach and began to set up our area to pop them off, so we began our show, we could hear our families cheers echo across the water from the dock, cheering as each folley went off in the air. Between lighting each selected firecracker, silence feel around us and all our family could see was our flashlights in the distance. My son was only 15yrs old and he was consumed with the fireworks, me on the other hand was watching for safety and keeping an eye on the dingy, you know just being a dad. Between fireworks I started to hear behind me in the dense woods a crackling noise and a sound I can only describe as a grunted or wooshing grunt sound very loudly, I sorta ignored it a first and then I began to pay more attention, my son concentrating on the next firework to light he was not registering the noise, suddenly the noise got much louder and my son stated, ""What was that Dad?"" I grabbed the flashlight and shined into the dark woods, it was so thick and dark, I could not see anything, the noise kinda stopped for a bit and I told my son, I think some farmer has some cows or something in those woods. The breathing and grunting noises reminded me of cows grunted or making bellowing noises. As a few minutes passed the noises seemed to be getting closer and reality set in, no fences and dense woods, I knew the area and several miles of dense woods was all that show on the local maps, so I began to constantly pay attention to the noises. My son was in the process of lighting another firework and I heard crashing of branches and grunting, a fowl smell, like body odor, I raised the flashlight into the woods and briefly just fleetingly between some trees, I saw a large, very large outline shadow of a man or wide man, with a shaggy appearence, no features only the outline, may have been a man for all I know, but if it was, it was one big dude, very wide in stature, in the middle of nowhere, with nothing to do but scare me. I looked back at my son and he was still trying to get the firecracker lit, I grabbed him, calmly told him to get into the dingy and we paddled away fast, despite my sons complaints, we left the folding chair, the remaining fireworks and a small cooler, I left and did not look back until I was well away from the bank. I got back to the dock across the lake, took out my map in the boat and surveyed the area around me, the map showed only dense woods, no camping grounds or marina's, only a dense wooded area unpopulated about 3 to 4 square miles in depth. Part of this area is zoned for bow hunting by the Hagerman Widelife refuge. My son still wonders what the noises were and I still get creeped out everytime I think about that night, something or someone was in those woods and took upon themselves to make noise because we had invaded that part of an unpopulated area, since that holiday night, I have heard others say they have heard people mention some sitings of bigfoot, but nothing substantiated.

I never told anyone about what I and my friend seen hunting after school one day. I don't remember me and him even talking about it very much. It was in 1987 it was hunting season I'm not sure the month. The two of us were walking along a dirt road in the Lockerplant river bottoms. Not sure which of us seen it first but definitely caught our attention.We were looking down a right of way when this large figure walked out of the trees. It walked along the tree line for several seconds going back into trees. At first we thought it was one hell of a big man or maybe someone hauling a deer across there shoulders. I remember asking [my friend] if that guy was wearing a fur coat. We knew what it was and it was not a man. The thing was at least 7 foot tall and covered in hair. It seemed to walk like a person, it was too far away to notice any details about face, hands or feet. I'm not sure but think it noticed us and that was the reason it never crossed the right of way.

"Ok, this happened about 2 years ago or maybe 2 1/2. I live on 10 acres of woods. All around me is woods. I was just falling asleep during a cool summer night. The 3 dogs I have lived outside in their pen I built. The dogs bark now and then at night but usually quiet down, being that they are used to noises. They started barking that night so I sat up in bed and yelled ""no"". They stopped but after a few seconds they were barking very loud and unusual. I thought that it may have been a wild hog that we see every so often. I got up and heard some movement below my bedroom window, which is about 6 feet above the ground. I grabbed my 357 and stood up. I heard something like foot steps but they sounded like a very heavy person taking huge steps, but not running. I took off out the front door and turned the outside lights on with the dogs still barking wildly. I had a flashlight, pointed it where the steps were at, only to see nothing. But, I did smell a strong odor of a skunk but not that harsh smell. I laid back down a few minutes later and finally gathered my thoughts together and called 911. I was wondering how I was going to report this. I talked with the 911 operator and was kind nervous when talking with her. She laughed and said something like its OK, an officer will be there. I didn't want the officer coming to the house unless they were able to find something.

"I arrived at site during fall thunderstorm and after it passed around 9 pm, set up to fish under bridge as the water was running and the catfish had swam upstream from Spence to feed. Observed one identifiable humanoid track (fresh) in river mud under bridge and several large smears along rivers side in 20 ft radius. Around 10 pm., from across the river, we heard 2 LOUD roars, that ended in a scream, grunt cough? This was unnerving, as we had fished this area several times times in the past and even though at times felt nervous in the area, maybe spooked?, nothing like this before. After the screams we heard a heavy moment in the thick mesquite in the area the roars came from, then a heavy thudding sound. Nothing more occurred for 1hr, until my fishing buddy said in a low voice that someone had just threw a rock at him, at that moment a large rock hit the dirt between us with a lot of velocity, I yelled to cut it out, and another roar answered me, this time there was no doubt it was time to leave. We gathered our gear as fast as possible and left for the truck parked up on the road above us, as we were walking up the concrete to the bridge, we both heard a heavy splashing and something running in the river below, {river at this time around 5 ft. deep due to run off} and a grunting noise. When we got to the truck we both saw river mud spattered all over the windshield, side and grill, and it had the most foul odor I've ever smelt, like the smell of lake mud when the lake turns over in the fall. I've never been spooked like that before or since. Also I've never returned to that spot because it scared me. Problem is, it's some great fishing!

"My wife and I had been working as the cleaning crew for a new housing development displaying various model homes on the edge of the city for a couple of months. As part of our contract we were required to clean a trailer used by the construction workers as an office, the trailer itself was at the bottom of a hill at the back of the development with a road coming down to it and turning to the right making a wide U. One night my wife and I had just finished cleaning and were getting ready to load all of our equipment back into our car, when my wife walked out of the trailer carrying supplies and looked off to her right to a shallow clearing near the trailer. She claims she saw a tall hairy figure with a pointed head watching her from behind a tree with Y shaped arms surrounded by small brush in the middle of a small clearing about 25ft. from us. She immediatly froze and watched it for 2-3 min. where she claimed it leaned to the side to look at her from around the tree, she then got upset and ran back in. I was rolling the cord to a vacuum when she told me of what she had seen, we turned off the lights because she felt we were being watched and I walked outside looking at the area she described but saw nothing so we ran to our car which was parked an equal distance in the other direction facing the area and turned on the headlights. We saw nothing when we did so we left the lights on and ran back in to finish locking up and then got back in the car, before we left we turned the car off and sat in the dark for about 10 min. hoping to catch a glimpse of whatever she saw. The following day we showed up early while there was still daylight and looked at the area, we were quite familiar with the immediate area and could not find anything nearby that she could have missidentified, nor did we see anything that may have been placed there the night of, the tree itself was about six feet up untill the arms split, and what she saw was a good shoulder profile. We followed several paths in the area that all lead into a thick wooded area with no housing behind it but found nothing before turning back.",Outside I-10 between the Silverado theatre and Bandera Rd. at the far back of a newly developed housing area with light residential activity.

He was swinging his arms like a human and he kept glancing back to see how fast we were apporaching.  He was  8 to 10 feet tall, had a hairy body and looked like the ones I have seen on TV.

"I was hunting Elk with my Bro in Law. Up in Chalk Creek. That is in Summit County in Utah. We had been in this deep canyon for some time. It was getting dark, so we heeded out of it. I can still see this in my head,..We were climbing up out of a small draw onto a flat meadow. As we got to the top of it. We both saw something very black in color move into a small stand of pine trees. It let out a huge Whoooff sort of sound as it went in. Also it moved a pine bow that flipped from the ground to about five feet in the air. My Bro in law said "" What the Heck was that""!!! As he put a shell into the chamber. This stand of pines was no bigger than a front yard. There was a clearing behind it. I have thought on this for some time. I think that we came in contact with it. And we surprised each other. The Creature was to our left, and we had a Beaver Dam to our right. The thing was about 30 feet away from us in the pines. We were on a Deer path between the pond and the pines. We backed up, and this thing let out a low gutteral growl at us. You could hear it's teeth chatter also. I have felt fear in my life, but a sense of evil came over me. On the way home we talked about what we had saw. We were so close to this thing. I know for a fact it was not a Bear or Moose. A Bear does not move that fast on it's hind legs.

"Me and 3 of my friends were hiking up Rock Canyon.  It was around 10:00pm and we were about 1 1/2 hours up the canyon, just before the rock canyon camp ground.  I remeber that there was no snow in the valley but once we got that high up, there was about 6 inches of hard, crusty snow on the trail.  I remember we had to talk louder than normal to hear one another over the loud, cruch of our feet walking on the crunchy snow.  We heard a noise that was so loud, but so far away it easily silenced our loud conversations with eachother and we instantly stopped in our tracks on the trail and looked at eachother as we all hear this loud noise.  The noise started off sounding like a loud motorcycle way off in the mountain range and then in morphed into a mechanical like scream.  I wish I could impersonate it so you can hear somewhat of what it sounded like but all I have are words.  The noise lasted for about 15-20 seconds.  It was SO LOUD but so far away you could hear it's massivness echoing throughout the entire back mountain range.  When the noise stopped, we all instantly started running down the mountain and didnt stop till we got to the bottom.  We were all 20 years old plus and we ALL heard something unlike anything we have ever heard before that was scary enough to make us all run down the mountain.  We all talked about it once we left the canyon and no one could think of any logical explanation or animal that could have made the noise.  To this day will all admit we heard something up Rock Canyon that night, we just dont know exactly what it was. About a month or so after this happened, I got really curious to what this noise could have been.    So I started researching noises on the internet to see if I could find a match.  I listened to Bear screams, mountain lion noises, wolverines, (even though I dont think they are native to utah) pretty much every animal that I could think of that could possibly make the noise we heard.  Nothing I researched came close to sounding like what we all heard that night.  Then I came across a Bigfoot audio.  I figured I'd give it a try, so I listened to it.  I got chills up my spine when I heard these bigfoot audio screams.  It sounds so simular to what we had heard.  It didnt perfectly match the noise we heard but it is the closest noise that ive found to come close to what we heard that night.",If you hike up the Rock Canyon trail.

"My family and I took a hike to the falls behind BYU family camp located in Aspen Grove, Ut.  Which is I think in Utah county.  On the way back we missed a turn on the regular trail and were soon on a game trail.  We had traveled about a mile down this trail when it became almost impassable.  I looked down to the right and recognized that we had passed the family camp and could see the end of the State Campground.  We were at the far end of the campground and about 1/2 to 3/4 miles above it.  I decided to take a game trail that was very over grown down the mountian side to trek back to the camp.  It was about 3:00 pm and I was concerned that we would be caught on the mountain at dark.  With me were my wife 50, my son 7, and my daughter 11 at the time. After leaving the bench we were on we pushed our way through the brush to the next bench.  As we made it to the clearing my daughter and I stopped cold and she said big foot!  What we saw was a footprint about 15 inches long and 6 to 8 inches wide.  The imprint was at least a 1/4 inch deep in the hard dirt.  My wife and son came up behind us and said the same thing.  I jumped up and down to try and make an imprint (I weigh 220 pounds) and could only make a small impression.  We looked around (a little because my family was frightened and I need to get them home) but we did not find any other evidence.

"Ok my wife and i decided to look at the fall leaves in covered brige canyon just off highway 6 about five minutes up spanish fork canyon. Instead of parking off the side of the road i decide to drive the short way up to the sterling hollow trailhead, so i get to the trail head and turn the jeep around so we could veiw the other side of the canyon. We decide to get out and we are standing in front of the jeep talking quietly, and my wife says she wants to sit in the jeep so i ask her why and she says she dont feel good about standing there, i had also noticed that uneasy feeling and agreed. I opened the passenger door for her then went around to the driver side and got in. I found the keys and started to start the jeep when i looked at my wife who was staring at the small gassy flat. I turned the key and a big fast black hairy object made me turn my head to the left, and i saw it run very fast into the thick oak trees. It looked about 6 feet tall hunched over, but it covered alot of ground fast. I saw it for only a few seconds. I looked at my wife, she sat frozen and i  knew what i saw ( i thought it was a bigfoot) so i asked my wife if it was a bear she said no so i asked if it was a moose she said no so i asked if it was a black cow and she said it was a hairy bigfoot. She said she had watched it the whole time after i let her in the jeep and got in myself till i started the jeep, and she said it was a bigfoot.

"Late one afternoon in Nov. 1986, my nephew came down and wanted to go deer hunting at Maud. I grew up hunting at the old Berry Farm. I put him in one of the deer stands that my brother and I had put up and I had went on to mine. I told him I would come back by the stand that he would be hunting out of so we could come out of the woods together. That afternoon it was starting to get dark but still light enough to see I started back towards my nephews stand. I started up a creek bottom that ran in to a big swamp thicket next to the lake when I smelt something with a very foul odor. I could hear something moving in the thicket, at first I thought it might be a deer, but it was too big to be a deer, and sounded more like a man walking in the water, so then I thought my nephew had got down and started to my stand so I yelled his name so he would know I was coming his way. This thing started moving away from me fast. Down the thicket about 50 to 75 yards there was a little opening about 30 feet across, this thing crossed the opening.

"This blind is the most remote blind on the 3,000 acre lease. The land consists of a couple of open fields, but is mostly heavily wooded. The blind I was in always has a lot of activity around it. You will see deer, bobcats, armadillos, coyotes, rabbits, all manner of birds, and hogs, lots of ferrell hogs. The blind sets at the end of the road, at the end of the property, in somewhat of a valley. As you exit the woods,the road turns slightly to right and drops down into the ""valley"". From where the road exits the woods to my blind is at least 700yds or more. The road continues on down to the blind, but when I am hunting, I park my truck and walk to the blind using a small flashlight so as not to disturbed the wildlife. The land opens up from one end of the ""valley"" to the other. There is about 300yds of fairly open gound from one tree line to the next. My blind sets on NW side at the tree line. As usual, there was a lot of wildlife activity, until about 7AM. All the animals, even the birds, left. Then I started to hear large branches breaking and then something hitting the trees with, I assume, the branches. The blind sets about 12' off the ground, but I never saw anything. I used my scope and binoculars, but the woods are very thick. About 30 minutes after the branch breaking started, a hog ran out of the woods from the direction of the noise and ran into one of the guide wires on my stand (3/8"" cable). Very easy to see. It then jumped up, ran into the ladder and then proceeded over the hill. It seemed to be a bit frightened. About an hour later, a branch hit my blind. When that happened,I almost had to change my drawers. The branch breaking and tree pounding kept up for about 2 1/2 hours. When the noise stopped and the wildlife came back, I left. The next morning, I went back to the blind, walking in as usual. About halfway, I could hear something walking with me. It was a little ways inside the brush. At that point, I reached in my hunting bag and got my headlamp and put it on. I put my flashlight up so I could get to my side arm easier. I never wanted to run so bad in my life but thought better of it. Just as I got to my stand, something very close to me made a very deep, grunting growl. That is the only way I can describe the sound. I dropped my hunting bag and went up the ladder into my stand in record time. About daybreak, the events from the previous day began again. I never smelled anything nor did I find any tracks. To be honest, being alone, I didn't look very hard. I just recently told one of my hunting buddies, and to my surprise he said, ""I knew there was something strange about that place."" He said ever since he started going out there, he has felt very uneasy, as if he is being watched, sometimes more than others. He has been hunting the woods all his life, so is very familiar with the surroundings. He told me there is one place he absolutely will not go on the lease.

We found where something had eaten a wild duck that was always at the pond. There was a very scary feeling back there. No one ever went back there at nite. Strange noises all the time seemed to be the norm. One nite, my sister was alone at the house, when something scared the horses and cattle so bad that a horse ran right into the side of the house.

Now we did smell rotten odors, but we brushed it off as being water moccasin's because they do have a terrible odor when near by, and at the time did not think anything of it. We also raised horses but nothing had really disturbed them. I was about 7 when this happened so I was terribly frightened. And a few days after the event I was out back and I looked into the feild and saw something large walking on two hind legs I would guess about 100 meters away. I know it was way too large to be anything human. Ever since then I have been scared to go out into the country at night anymore.","About 3-4 miles from hwy 59 on a dirt road back then, now slightly paved.

"Our family has some property down in deep East Texas at the top of what is called the Piney Woods region.  We have about 200 acres with open pasture fronting a farm-to-market road and pushing back into the middle of the property and heavy woods in a U shape on the sides and back into the back of the parcel.  There are two stream that originate on the land and another that passes through; two in the east woods, one in the west.  On the east side the woods are many miles deep going back across other properties and all the way over to some river bottom land where the Neches River runs through that part of the country. Anyway it was early spring before the leaves had come out and everything was still fairly dead looking except the evergreens.  I was out playing 50 yards from the trailer on the outside ring of a tall stand of large trees and about 250 yards from the edge of the forest.  It was about dusk, just before dinner time, but there was enough light to clearly see down into the edge of the forest.  I kept getting the willies or the feeling that something was not quite right and for some reason I was drawn to look to the east woods tree line - like I felt I was being watched, but I don't think I would have put it that way at the time.  I just stopped playing ( I had just come down from climbing a sweetgum tree and was looking for lizards at the base) and kept looking at the tree-line several times.  About the second or third time this happened I noticed a low evergreen shrub (in the shadows of the woods even evergreens look kinda grey/brown or just darker than the surroundings) or at least a dark pear shape that I took to be like a small bushy cedar just inside the forest canopy - I thought something like ""that sure looks like a big person shaped bush . . . "" and probably thought it looked creepy or something.  A few moments later the feeling was so strong I stood straight up and looked right at that bush - no scanning the line - that bush was what I focused on. I must have stood there stock still for a solid 20 count just staring at this shape when I got the shock and, frankly, the fright of my young life!  The damned thing stood up and ambled off into the woods!  Down into a streambed and up the other bank off into the forest to be exact!  It looked just exactly like a very large man wearing a solid dark fur parka pulled up over it's head only there's just no way it was a dude in a coat - there was no variation in clothing, no lines, waving flapping wrinkling nothing.  I can tell you I was jolted with fear like nothing you can imagine - first to realize I had been observed for all that time and second by something big and very monster looking to me at the time (I was eleven).  After it was gone I ran into the house crying that I had seen a monster in the woods.  My father dismissed the entire affair as a black cow down in the woods, but I've been out in those woods all my life and even had the cows come up on me in the woods while I was camping out - that was no cow. On a side note, although I've never again seen anything fishy down at that property, there have been reports in Rusk County over the years, which is just one county south of Cherokee County.  Also, when my father and I were discussing this event recently my dad pointed out something I thought a bit odd.  We have sometimes heard the thunderous pounding of our entire herd of cows running up through the pasture away from the woods, always at night, and always up from the woods.

"I was family camping with my wife, daughter, and father below Huntington Reservoir.  The last two nights of this trip while sitting around the fire late at night we started hearing a moaning sound that sounded like it was coming from the opposite ridge roughly 2-4 miles away.  We heard these sounds repeatedly for over an hour on both  nights and they seemed to be coming from at least two different directions.  My father and I are both avid bigfoot enthusiasts and have been to all of the locations of recent sightings in Utah posted on your site.  But, this trip we weren't even thinking about it or talking about when my father said do you hear that.

"Not certain of the exact date of this occurrence, but I was lying in bed awake about 3am and was startled by what sounded like something pushing up against and rattling the vinyl siding on our house. This woke Lisa my wife up. I went outside with a flashlight but didn't see anything. We didn't think much of this at the time. Then we had two other occurrences within a two week time span. On Friday, November 16, around 6:15pm my wife and myself were almost home from our daily walk and while at the intersection of Northridge and Old Saltworks Rd., approximately 200 yards from our house we both heard and were surprised by a very loud, deep, guttural sound that was something between a growl and a roar. It only lasted for a couple of seconds. It was very voluminous and powerful. We just stopped and asked each other what on earth did we just hear. Then the incident that was the icing on the cake that made us come to this website and file this report, occurred on Friday, November 23 around 9pm. I shined a light behind our house to see if there were any deer out feeding. About 160 yards from our deck in a small patch of woods behind our house I saw two, large, brilliant, emerald green eyes, which were the shape of human eyes, but were about 7-8 inches apart. This freaked me out. I am an experienced outdoors-man and have logged several hundred days afield over the past 35 years. I have walked for hours by flashlight to get to hunting stands and have never ever seen eyes this shape and of this brilliance and set this far apart before. Before these occurrences I was very skeptical of all the Bigfoot stories and sightings I have seen or read about, but now I am open to the possibility that there is something out there that could fit the description of a Bigfoot. What we heard was very unique, and combined with the eye shine I saw, has changed my mind and opened me up to the possibility of a Sasquatch type creature lurking in the shadows. This is very exciting!","26485 Old Saltworks Rd.

"Back in 2006 my husband and I were out just kind of exploring and looking for a good camp spot up on top of Monte Cristo, maybe 5 miles at most from Ant Flat Road. (Thats a dirt road that cuts off of the paved road and takes you to Hardware Ranch). We finally found a really amazing spot at at the top of Scare Canyon. It was grassy and had tons of Aspen trees. So we parked and got out of the truck. Down from us and through the trees about 50 yards was a ""watering hole"" for cattle and such. We decided to stretch our legs and walk down to it. When we got there I noticed that it was REALLY quiet, but I just kind of brushed it off. We spent about 10 minutes at this pond and then walked back. We made dinner and just sat around talking until about 10:45pm. Thats when I got scared. Our dog was whining and whimpering, she was running all around our campsite and could not be comforted. She is a medium sized dog (red heeler and chow chow mix) and she has been around all sorts of big game before. She has never acted this way. So I get into the back of the truck where we were sleeping and Lady (our dog) jumped into the truck with me, hid behind me and was shaking. At this point I was trying to coax my husband into the truck so we could just go to bed. He finally got in about 20 minutes later and he went straight to sleep. I and the dog, on the other hand, did not sleep. Lady kept looking out the window and kind of growling/whining. So I sat up and what I saw freaked me out! In the light of the full moon I could see a VERY tall dark figure standing about 25 yards from us. At first I thought maybe it was a moose looking either at us or away from us because it was tall and skinnier than if you saw a moose standing sideways. I was scared but very curious, so I sat staring for maybe 5 minutes. It finally moved...It took about 4 or 5 steps in the direction of the stock pond. Thats when I realized it wasn't a moose or any other four-legged animal!! I got a bad feeling in the pit of my stomach and just laid back down. I couldn't sleep after that!

"I was 21 and had just returned about 6 months before from living in japan for 2 years. The general season mule deer hunt had just opened and i decided to go hunting one day after my college classes had ended, i remember thinking how stupid it was that i had to  go to class during the hunt and didn't want to while i driving/sliding my car up a snowy road. i turned off the paved road onto a farm road and went past a house that was under construction and parked in the small trailhead lot. instead of going up the mountain i walked a short distance around a field and sat down on a steep slope overlooking a valley, a few hills and some trees. i sat looking through my binoculars at the deer bedded down in the trees wondering why they wouldn't get up and forage in the trees for nuts or grasses. as i sat watching i heard a loud crashing sound coming from the trees nearer to the house/ barn that was being built, it may have even been watching them as it was very close to the house. i looked through my binoculars and could see a large black shape moving through heavy cover and at first thought it was a black bear but as i watched it didn't have the bouncing motion that bears have when they run because their front legs are shorter than the rear legs. it was moving very gracefully. i watched as it plowed through thick brush like a bull until it made it to more open ground in the trees and noticed how strange it really was. it was moving on two legs and moving fast. i looked and saw all the deer running. unfortunately it was in the other direction and turned back to the animal. i watched in amazement was it went straight into a massive stand of buck brush that i couldn't have gotten through with a machete. it kept moving at a phenomenal pace and was gone over a ridge in just a few seconds. i've hunted and hiked alone for years and come toe to toe with both black bears and mountain lions and never, ever been that afraid before. i imnedeiatly put a bullet into my rifle and backed away from the spot, never turning my back. i got in my car and left. my dad and brother and brother in law keep wanting to go back there because we've seen deer there but i have never gone back. even when i hunt the other end of the wellsville mountains i stay with someone because of the experience. z","Wellsville Mountains, west of Logan.",Cache County,Utah,Winter,Report 26948: Daylight sighting by hunter near rural homes in the Wellsville Mountains,41.7086,-112.0179,10/21/2006,26948,Class A,9x2m6bz41w,46.72,36.135,25.55,27.86,0.75,0.49,0.98,0,0,,1024.63,Foggy in the morning.,4,5.9,4,0.41
"In August of 2004, my family and I were camped at Hoop Lake, in the Uinta Mtns of Utah.  Just south of our camp was the outflow stream of Hoop Lake that cut a very deep gorge, some 100+ feet deep.  Along that gorge runs an ATV trail, that we rode along quite often during our four-day camp.  The ATV trail ends on the shoulder of a mountain, and overlooks about 3,000 acres of meadow and climax forest. On the morning of the incident, my wife, myself and two of our nephews took an ATV ride along the trail.  We ended our ride at the shoulder, and turned off the vehicles. We had been talking about sasquatch sightings and I had expressed the sentiment that I thought it would be awesome to see a sasquatch.  My nephews asked me if it made sounds, and I said that it's vocalizations had been recorded.  They asked what it sounded like, and I told them that I would imitate it. I made as loud a vocalization as I could, trying to recall the tonality, and pitch of the recordings.  When I stopped, the sound echoed off of the walls surrounding the meadow, and down a nearby canyon.  It was quite eery to hear the echoes.  They asked me to do it again, and I did.  The third time I made the call, something answered back from the forest next to the meadow.  The hair stood up on the back of our necks, and we decided that we had heard enough. As we started to leave, one of my nephews shouted ""What's that Uncle B.....?""  I turned and saw a cow moose bolt out of the trees on a full gallop.  As it ran it continued to look back into the trees. I am not necessarily convinced that what I heard was a sasquatch, but I have heard many different animals (bears, coyotes, elk, deer, hawks, falcons, eagles, and wolves), and the sound that I heard didn't match any of those sounds.","Drive south, out of Mountain View, Wyoming.

"I was backpacking with my brother and four nephews at Granddaddy Lake.  We were setting up camp, and my brother and I went off to find a tree to hang our food on.  We were getting closer to a group of boy scouts we had been hearing while setting up camp.  My brother was looking into the trees and I glanced over towards where the scouts were, when I saw something with long white/blond hair was staring into their camp.  It must have been startled by our presence because it took off running extremely fast toward the marsh area.  I remember very vividly the hair bouncing as it took long strides.  The lack of noise that it made along with the speed startled me to the point that I unbuckled my gun holster, concerned for our safety.  My brother didn't see what I did because he was too concerned with why I was going for my gun.

"October 16, 2012, between 2 and 3 am.  My wife and I were on our Honeymoon in Linden, VA. We rented a cabin for the week. During the night, I woke up to a sound similar to what I thought was our dog dragging a suitcase across the hardwood floor.  But she was in fact, in bed with us, on point looking out the bedroom window. The draggin sounds were long footsteps coming from outside. We listened to them for about 20 seconds or so as they were getting closer.  A silhouette then quickly, but smoothly, passed right by the window.  We quietly listened until we could not hear anymore footsteps, and then talked about what it may have been for a little while until we decided to just go back to sleep (our dog ALWAYS growls and barks at people, but she didnt, so we figured it was just an animal, or a tree limb swinging past the window).

It was so low in tone that we actually felt it in our joints and ribcage.  it lasted a few seconds before we high tailed it out of there.  There was no way after hearing that, that I was going to stick around, unarmed, with my family.  The growl wasnt loud at all, it was just bone rattling deep.

It was just after dusk and my 13 year old daughter and I were traveling at about 40 MPH. I came around a bend through a wooded area when my headlights caught an animal that was hairy, walked upright and stood about 8 feet or so tall. The animal paused in the middle of the road and as we slowed down the animal turned its head to look in our direction, after a few seconds the animal turned and continued walking south into the woods.

"My husband and I where sitting on the front porch one evening when what I thought was a bear caught my attention on the edge of the tree line. I told my husband to look at the bear and he stated that was not a bear because it was to large. We continued watching for approximately two minutes when a deer darted out from the tree line. The dark mass I thought was a bear then stood up and chased the deer into the woods. My husband and I looked at each other in disbelief at what we had just saw. It was too far away to get great detail of the animal but close enough to tell that it was very large and dark brown / black in color. After seeing it chase the deer on two legs back into the forest, I knew instantly that no bear could have ran so fast and so graceful on two legs.  The next evening my husband went to the same spot in the tree line while I stayed on the porch so we could compare the sizes between the animal and him.

"It was early bow season around oct 5, 2004 approx 6:30 pm. It was pretty cold and the wind was blowing in all directions. I was sitting in my tree stand on top of a ridge over looking a creek bottom with minimal vegation spaced along it. this area is pretty remote and is a traveling place for our deer. Well it was about dusk when I heard some crows in the tree tops above the creek started to make alot of noise. I then saw three deer running full out down the creek bed, I heard a scream and the a loud thump. two of the deer I saw head in another direction, but the one remained down in the vegatation thrashing around. I thought perhaps it had been wounded by another hunter, and decided to go down there and investigate. As I went down the hill to the creek bed, the wind shifted blowing right in my face, the smell what would i asume was nasty body odor, was so strong it made me feel kinda sick.As I looked around for the deer, a uneasy feeling kinda came over me,I got scared, i then heard what I could only describe as sticks being tapped together or up against down logs or even trees,coming from two diffrent directions, kinda like it was in a circling manner. I then heard some type of weird scream, at that moment I decide to get the heck out of dodge, I turned back up the hillside and proceeded back up towards my tree stand, the next thing I know a white acorn bounced off the top of my head, I dismissed it as pherhaps falling from a tree, but when the next one flew by my head, I relazied something was throwing objects at me, I then got real scared and decided to run, as I got alittle ways away I paused to catch my breath, as I was resting I heard whistling and jabberish popping and clicking sounds, once again in two diffrent directions, I heard leaves crunch and out of the corner of my I eye I saw something very big trying to blend in with the trees and bushes observing me I guess.when I heard the whistling again from behind me I just took off, and never returned. It was like black and tan mix whatever it was and very big. That is the most ever I have been scared in my life, to my knowledge this area is very remote and I have never seen anyone back there and I have been hunting that for years, whatever it was it was after that deer,and for the sounds ihave never heard those types of noises made by any animal organic to that area.",scott co. va near dungannon,Scott County,Virginia,Fall,"Report 12727: Bow hunter is escorted from woods by foul-smelling, acorn-throwing bipeds",36.8778,-82.4179,10/16/2004,12727,Class B,dnt3u93hg8,56.18,45.145,34.11,36.55,0.7,0.59,0.09,0.0036,1,rain,1008.47,Light rain in the morning.,4,9.58,248,5.99
"Hi, I am relaying this story for my brother since I have access to the net and he does not, but I will relate the story to you just as he told it to me with his permission. My name is [PB], I am 35 years old and live in Salem, VA in Roanoke County. My brother [RB] who actually had the sighting on April 4 of this year is 8 years younger. I have several rental properties in this area and my brother is my repair person/handy man.  One particular rental property is vacant and it happens to be directly in front of the house that I live in now.  On Thursday April 4, 2002, my brother was painting the interior of this house.  I work 2nd shift and usually get home around 11:30 each night.  At 11:30 I noticed that my brother was still working on the house so I stopped to see how things were going.  He was visibly shaken so I asked him if anything was wrong.  He then told me that at aprox. 10:45pm that night, he took a break and went out to the front yard to smoke a cigarette.  He heard a dog barking back in the woods, about a 100 yards away.  A short time later my dog became extremely agitated, barking and growling.  He was startled because he had never known my dog to behave in this manner.  He then heard something large ""crashing"" through the trees, and what he saw, he just couldn't beleive.  He said he saw a ""very large creature"" traveling at a high rate of speed and making a very loud ""gutteral grunting noise"" running much faster than a human could possibly run.  He said he got a very good look at it before it crossed the road and went out of sight. It's arms were swinging down by it's sides.  He said it was very broad and very tall but he could not tell me just how tall it was.  He said that it was very hairy, and described the hair as ""long and curly like a sheepdog"".  He said that it appeared to be a silver-gray color.  (All the reports of bigfoot sightings I have ever read however seem to say that they are brown or black in color).  My brother said that he would be glad to speak to anyone who might be interested in hearing his story first hand.  This is also not the first sighting in this area that I have heard about.  I also have a good friend who tells me that he saw a ""Bigfoot"" while out scouting for deer in Ironto VA. in Montgomery county.  Acording to my GPS, it is 9 miles from here as the crow flies. I can honestly say that I absolutely beleive my brother's story and my friend's as well.

"While on a training exercise in Ft. Pickett, VA., I was positioned in an observation point overlooking a camp. I was lying low in our hide providing over watch while my team member attempted to move in to within approximately 75 yards of this camp. It was at this point when three distinct knocking sounds spread no more than 1 second apart, were heard from our 6 o’clock position. The distance appeared to be within 100 yards. After a very short pause of about three, maybe five seconds, there was the sound of a large branch or small tree breaking in half. The noise was so loud that everyone in the camp grabbed their flashlights and searched the tree line towards the direction of the sound. We were almost compromised by this noise, but as quickly as the sounds were heard, the forest fell silent. Unfortunately, no one was able to further investigate those sounds due to our focus being the exercise and not the wild life. Approximately two, maybe three hours later, one of the cadre was listening to a range radio and overheard a conversation between an adjacent range and range control. The conversation spanned only a few minutes, but in summary it went like this: “Range Control, this is range #... umm, there is a Bigfoot walking across the range!” This range was only a few kilometers from our location. Early the next morning, maybe 5am, one of the members of our team had to depart the training environment so he was given a coordinate to meet for ex-filtration. He arrived early and waited until the extraction team arrived. During his time alone, he commented that he heard loud foot steps behind him. He was not sure if it was a large deer coming to investigate or what, but he said it came very close to him. So close that he was hearing this animal breathing behind him only a little ways off. He said he felt uneasy and didn’t dare turn around because his initial thought was that it might just be a buck that would become startled and attack him. A few moments later, the animal departed and shortly after he was extracted. He didn’t want to think of this animal as anything but perhaps a deer. After the exercise, we spoke with the role players about that night. They all heard the sound and thought one of us was trying to play a game with them or that one of us had fallen down the side of an embankment causing the loud noise. Once we advised them that it was not us, they just went silent and didn’t speak of it any further. The strange thing is that earlier that night I had this eerie feeling, like something was watching me from behind. My reaction at the time was to grasp my knife and prepare for whatever may come next. It never reached that point, but my senses were heightened and I found myself scanning my surroundings more often with my night vision. Due to the nature of my work, I cannot go into great detail as to the exact month or day, but I can mention that it was in the early months leading up to spring.

"Two friends and I were backpacking on great north mountain in the winter of 2002. It was our second night and we reserved a stone cabin from the PATC, named sugar knob cabin, we had not seen anyone all day. There was an ice storm coming and we attributed it to that. We made a fire outside the cabin just before dusk while it was still nice out. We began to hear slow moving, very heavy footsteps walking around the perimeter of the location we were at. We thought it was a bear or a deer but it was clearly on two feet by the sounds it was making. We called out to see if it was a poacher or just someone walking around but no response was given. This is a pretty remote spot and definitely not very visited in the winter months. The walking sounds continued but because the sun was down by now we could not see too far into the woods. We all heard the walking sounds for quite a while and it really freaked us out so much so we abandoned the fire and pretty much locked ourselves into the cabin. All of us had a lot of outdoor experience and had backpacked a lot as well. We had never heard or experienced anything like this before. The sounds got closer once inside the cabin. It is a stone cabin so it is fairly well Insulated from noise. So whatever it was, was large. The footsteps seemed to stop and continue for maybe an hour or so. We made dinner inside and after we ate the footsteps were right next to the cabin, there was a window opposite the door with wood shutters on the blinds that were closed so I opened them expecting to see a person but we all witnessed a dark, very hairy large face looking at us about a foot outside the window. We were terrified, shaking and speechless. The creature took off after a few seconds of seeing us and vise versa. We never heard anymore sounds after that either. We stayed up all night, though just kind of standing guard. The next morning we awoke to ice everywhere and could not find any tracks or evidence of what we saw and heard. We hiked down the stony creek trail to the cars as fast as we could without getting hurt with the ice on the ground. There was a cabin journal at that time and we read it over that night after the incident and read several accounts that were similar to ours.

"It was dusk and I was walking one of my sister's dogs. It had been raining but wasn't at the time we were walking.

"Since this happened 4 years ago you can tell I've been somewhat haunted by it. How I came to believe what I saw was Gigantopethicus or something very like it took time to develop and just tonight (June 26, 2007) after reading the news item about the expedition to the UP of Michigan, finding your site and then seeing Bill Munns model of Giganto on http://www.uiowa.edu/~bioanth/giganto.html I'm convinced I saw something out of the ordinary. After driving in from our home in NY my daughter and I were staying in a cabin for a few days at the Staunton River State Park, VA with a friend of hers from VA. On the night in question I had to drive to Danville to pick up and bring back another daughter who was coming up from Greensboro to stay with us for the weekend. Her bus didn't pull in to Danville until around 11PM so I left the park around 9PM. It was a dark, rainy drive with some patchy but not heavy fog. Because of the conditions and my unfamiliarity with the road I concentrated more on driving than noticing much of the surroundings. At some point around 1/2 way I was coming around a wide bend to the left when my headlights fell upon a broadside view of what I first thought was a huge dog, just off the road moving from left to right. It simply turned it head to look at the lights and lumbered slowly but deliberately towards the treeline. It was then I realized it was no dog. Maybe a lion? It had huge eyes like a lion as well as a mane. But it wasn't shaped like a lion, it was big in the front, big head, big shoulders and chest but more streamlined to the rear. Walking on all fours but not like a dog or big cat. The front legs seemed taller than the rear. If you remember the monster in the scifi movie 'Forbidden Planet' you'll have pretty good idea of it's shape, not of course as exaggerated as that but similar. It did not appear startled or afraid, it simply walked in towards the trees while watching my car drive past. Since then I had no idea what it could have been until I read something about Gigantopethicus and saw a pic of a statue of it on all fours on a website. That statue I thought was close but no cigar. Then tonight I found the Bill Munns picture with the model in color and it clicked. It was very much the same coloring, mane, head and eyes. The only difference was the size, what I saw was huge, on all fours maybe almost the size of a Volkswagen Beetle but if it stood up not quite so tall...but then again the sighting was only seconds before I had to return my attention to navigating the rest of the turn at maybe 40 miles per hour.

"I have grown up in the outdoors and been hunting and fishing my entire life. From a childhood spent in North Georgia to stints in West Virginia and now (for the past 16 years) in Virginia, I have spent a great bit of time in the woods. I know animals and flora and that is why what occurred back in the fall of '03 has bothered me so much to this day, enough to finally submit this report. My former roommate's father owns the property this incident took place on. I have had access to it since I was 15. It's a small sportsman’s paradise of nearly 200 acres and a 5-acre bass pond. I had hunted it every fall since '94 and had fished there for years before that. I hit the woods, completely scent proof, at about 3:30AM and hiked from the farmhouse appx. 600 yards back to the deer stand I was planning on using that morning. I stopped short about 100 yards to apply a drag rope (doe in rut scent) and then crossed the creek bridge and walked a wide pattern out in front of the stand to put out several scent markers on the game trails. This took perhaps 15 minutes and no game animals were spooked. I then headed back towards the tree stand, tied off my rifle and gear to a safety rope, climbed the stand and pulled up my gear. This would give me a full hour and a half to let the woods settle down and help my presence go unnoticed. What happened next has cost me countless nights of sleep and still gives me chills every time I think about it. Once in the stand I went about the business of sorting out my gear and making sure everything was where I would need it, binoculars, grunt caller, etc. Out of nowhere came the most god awful, blood-curling scream/yell/growl that I had ever heard in my life. The morning calm was completely shattered and it sounded close. I immediately ran the a mental list in my mind as to what it could be, but nothing I had ever heard before could match this in either pitch, depth, or duration. It lasted for at least 5-7 seconds. I was scared. It started so high and just kept expanding in pitch into a howl that ended in a menacing guttural growl. Before the sound was even over I realized/felt extreme danger. The real fear was from the fact that the volume was so loud and it came upon me so suddenly that I knew it was close, too close, within say 25 yards. Following the ""howl"" there was complete silence. I immediately felt to close to the ground, for whatever reason (in a 17ft. tree stand), and carefully stood up so that my feet were not dangling off the seat. I pulled out my mag light and started scanning the area to my front and right that the sound seemed to come from. I tried to listen for further movement while scanning, but realized that my ears were actually ringing from the howl. I remember thinking (from previous survival training) to keep cool and not panic, and figure this out. I quickly chambered a round and checked to make sure the safety was on my rifle, a Winchester model 70 in .300WSM. I then continued scanning between the woods to my front and the pine thicket to my immediate right with my flashlight. I just felt so vulnerable, and remembered thinking that this rifle might not be enough so I fetched my S&W.40 handgun from my backpack and secured it to my belt (now I know that it's unlawful to carry a sidearm during rifle season, but there are black bear on this property and I wasn’t going to leave myself without an option). It took several moments for my hearing to return and when it did I heard distinctive movement back in the pine thicket to my front and right, maybe 20 yards into the trees. Then nothing. That’s when the smell hit me. I'm not sure I noticed it at first because I had been handling deer scents, but I smelled what I can only describe as a ""rotten cabbage/ripe dumpster"". It didn’t last long, and there was no noticeable wind at the time of this incident to carry this scent. I stood there in that tree stand for the next two hours until first light and then got the hell out of there. I'm not the type to scare easily and I was right back out there two days later, but didn’t think to check for tracks or any other evidence. The game was still scarce. I've been back several times since then to fish the pond and nothing out of the ordinary ever occurred during those trips. I totally forgot about this incident for nearly a year. It bothered me so I just didn’t think about it. That changed when I caught a documentary on T.V. concerning bigfoot/Sasquatch. The BFRO was mentioned and I found your website out of curiosity. I was stunned when I read the report (also in Franklin Co.) that you had listed, but was even further stunned when I listened to some of the recording in your database. Several (from '73 and '78 I think) sounded similar to the very beginning of the howl during my incident, but the sound I heard was so close and loud and went so deep at the end that they are tough to compare. Whatever made that noise had one hell of a set of lungs though. I was also surprised about the smell that ""they"" supposedly emit when threatened. I had no idea. That was the icing on the cake that made me think that I might have possibly had an encounter. I've always been someone comfortable in the woods, and for the most part I'm still that person, I'm just a little more aware of what could possibly be out there.","From Roanoke: 220 South to Rocky Mount, then 40 West past Ferrum College",Franklin County,Virginia,Fall,Report 13212: Possible pre-dawn vocalization heard by hunter near Ferrum,36.94165,-80.04166,11/13/2003,13212,Class B,dnx44t52wn,45.65,38.555,31.46,21.67,0.4,0.24,0.64,0.0002,1,rain,1014.11,Breezy throughout the day and partly cloudy until afternoon.,3,10,295,17.47

"I was ridding my atv on the family farm going down an old washed out road which you can’t drive fast on. As I started down the road looking down at the road then looking up down the road something caught my eye about 150 to 200 yards down this road. The sun was to my left shining across this road to the right as I looked down this narrow road there was a reflection of the light coming off the fur of something that I never had seen before,it was tall and massive. For that split second I saw it. The way the suns reflection came off of this thing it look almost silver. But being a hunter (I hunt this land all the time) There isn’t anything silver in color. And that the sun coming off the back of a black turkey can look silver. So that’s what caught my eye. This animal went back in to the woods back to the right. I worked my way down to where I thought I saw it. I turned my atv off and smoked a cig. Listing for any thing and about 5 min. had past and I heard something big running away from my direction breaking big tree limbs. (It was way louder than a deer running through the thickets). I could hear this for about 1 to 2 seconds and then it went quiet again. If I had to guess how far away it was I would say about 50 to 60 yards away from me when I first heard the running. (You cant see more than 20 yards in to this thickets from where I was at. (Hunting season end for general firearms 10 days before this so the deer are still alert.) Then it seemed like a couple of min. later I heard two big bangs like someone hitting a stick against a tree or log then the hair on the back of my neck stood up.Then there was the snorting of the deer that came from the thicket right after that. (When a deer snorts from my experience in the woods during the day they see you and snort once or twice and then they take off leaving you just to see there white tail waving at you as they go out of sight.) But there must have been 4 or 5 white tail in there all of them snorting and stomping the ground and they were real loud.The deer did this for about what seamed to be more than a min.then I heard them take off running. And that’s when I decided it was time for me to leave too.I went home and told my wife about what had just happened and she couldn’t believe it and was surprised at what I told her and ask if it was bear? I told her I never saw a beer in the woods and it seamed way to big to be a black bear.So the next day (Wednesday the 22nd) I wasn’t going to GO BACK THAT DAY.I took a camera in where I heard this animal and took pictures of what I believe to be footprints and some hair that was left on a tree limb about 5 1/2 feet off the ground",,Franklin County,Virginia,Winter,Report 10082: Hunter has daylight encounter near Gills Creek,37.06266,-79.82829,12/21/2004,10082,Class A,dnx4z7ncdh,54.42,41.815,29.21,21.44,0.56,0.44,0.35,0,0,,1021.18,Mostly cloudy throughout the day.,2,10,255,1.86
"It was late July 2007 and my wife and I had brought our newborn baby daughter home just a few days earlier. It was about 1 AM and I was in the living room of my house watching television after pulling 2nd shift at work. My wife and baby daughter were two rooms away sleeping. She had opened the bedroom window earlier to let a little cool air in. All of a sudden a scream came from that corner of the house that stood me right up off the couch. I ran to the bedroom to find my wife sitting up in the bed as wide eyed and shocked as me. When I finally gathered myself enough and went outside to investigate, I found nothing. We kind of forgot about it until watching Finding Bigfoot several years later. They played what they thought were howls of the creature recorded on tape. My wife and I looked at each other and totally agree that whatever made the howls on the program is exactly what we heard that night. It's a sound you never forget.","Where we live is in town, but are surrounded by woodlands and have rivers and lakes close by.

"I am an avid runner. I run close to 50 miles a week every week. I often run the exact same route. When I trail run I have been followed by deer and other wildlife that comes up from time to time. However, today was different. First I was not on a trail but on a country road near my house. I crossed a main road and was headed out to my turn around point. There is a thick wooded area on the right hand of the road. I heard something in the woods and thought maybe it was a deer or a dog. I kept running but the noise kept happening. It was like someone was in the woods just out of sight running in the leaves as I was running on the road. I would slow down and it would slow down. I would speed up and it would speed up. When I passed a house the noise would stop for a few yards and then pick back up again in the wooded areas. I am an avid hunter. This really sounded like a person or something like a person running along in the woods as I ran the road. Thing is the wooded side of the road is very up and down with several deep drop offs. So whatever was keeping pace with me was able to navigate them with no problem at all. I run a 9 minute mile pace. So whatever was following me in the woods had to keep that pace yet in the woods and the deep valley areas. Maybe I was hearing things.

"I put off sharing this story publicly for some time. When the incident occurred, I was working in Law Enforcement at a Regional Jail in Virginia. Stories of Bigfoot always intrigued me, and because I read quite a bit about them, my fellow officers got a kick out of asking me questions about Bigfoot habits. A couple of friends who worked with me decided we should do a ""Bigfoot Hunt"", aka, a weekend camping trip. We told other people we were heading out to find Bigfoot in jest, we were all really going to just get away from everything for a couple of days. We all met up and traveled into Giles County, Virginia into the Jefferson National Forest. This was not a new place for a couple of the guys in our group who camped, fished and hunted in the area most of their lives. In all, about 10 of us, most of us Law Enforcement Officers, wound up camping that weekend. The first night was on a Friday Night. It was clear skies and crisp air, but no moon. Some of the group decided right before the sun set to take a hike through the woods. To the best of my recollection, we were only a short distance from the West Virginia Border, so the trail actually went up into the mountains around us, we were in what would best be described as a kind of horseshoe valley with mountains and very densely wooded area surrounding us. It took them a couple of hours to make it back to camp and we all sat around the campfire talking and telling stories until about 11:00pm or so, and some of the guys who had worked that day went to bed. We had our tents set up around the clearing of the camping space we had, most of the tents fairly close to the campfire area. A few of us sat up around the fire and continued talking. Around 12:30am or so, while we were talking we heard what I would describe as a vocalization on a ridge that I would estimate was about a mile or so from us. We all stopped talking and looked at each other. Within a few seconds, there was a second vocalization from another area that was to our left and had to have been another creature answering the first one. There were no more sounds, but it did make us all take a moment and try to figure out what it was. A couple more guys went to bed and that left me and another gentleman who had came with a co-worker, sitting at the campfire. While we were talking, I kept hearing these ""Click"" sounds behind us. I realized it was small stones or pebbles being thrown and hitting the picnic table that was about 10 feet away. We took out our flashlights and shined them into the trees but saw nothing. There was just an eerie feeling of being watched from that point on. Even though we could see nothing, I couldn't shake that feeling. I decided to sleep in my car that night instead of my tent. It was such a black night outside that without light, you couldn't see your hand in front of your face. Very dark night. A creature could have walked around the camp and we would have never seen it outside the campfire light. The next morning, I would say about 30 minutes before the sun came up. It was light outside, but not quite day yet, after a very sleepless night, a few guys had come out of their tents and we met at the picnic table. I was telling the guys what had happened the night before, there was 4 of us at the table and another guy was building the campfire back up, we heard what I can only describe as talking. It was loud enough that all of us heard it, and it came from the dense woods behind where we were standing. It sounded like a language I had never heard before, like a mix of something that sounded Russian or Eastern European and an Asian language of some kind mixed. The sound was about 3 to 5 seconds long, like it was saying a sentence and then it was silent. We were all pretty much shocked into silence as we looked at each other then at the woods. Keep in mind, almost all of us were cops, and many of us were armed, but none of us was going into the woods to see what had spoke. I stayed for the day, still wondering what we had encountered the night before and that morning. I didn't stay the second night. Some of the guys who had not been up when the incidents occurred gave those of us who had experienced the events a hard time in jest, but I wasn't staying out there again. Could we have been pranked? Possibly, but if anyone knew who we were and what we did for a living, that would have been a dangerous thing to do at night. I also don't know anyone who would have been that far out in the middle of nowhere that would have stayed out there all night long just to mess with us.

My family and I recently spent some time living on the Delmarva Peninsula in VA. When the nights were cool enough we would open the windows of our fifth wheel trailer. On two different nights (the only nights we had the windows open) we heard vocalizations in the surrounding forest. On the first night it was about 2:AM and close to 50 degrees F. I heard two distinctly different voices coming from two different directions as if answering each other. This went on for about ten minutes as the sources seemed to move. Dogs in the small town nearby started barking almost instantly (and I do mean all of them). When I told the wife she blew me off because she is or was a skeptic. On the second occurrence the wife was alone because myself and the kids had gone back home too South Texas. She had the windows open and it was about 1:30 AM and close to 60 degrees. Both nights were very cloudy do to the cold fronts that had made the nights cooler. The wife is an avid outdoorsman and even lived in campgrounds from LA to WI growing up and always had the windows open weather permitting. This is important because nothing common wakes her up. She was sleeping when the vocalizations woke her up and made every hair on her body stand up. The sounds were of two or three different voices including one that she said was undoughtably male. They lasted for about five minutes and stopped as the dogs started barking when the subjects came closer to town. The voices were a cross between a woman making a blood curdling scream and a howl. The best I can type it out is AAAooOP! First one would sound off then another and on occasion a third. After her experience I played the wife some song clips off the internet and she said they were very close to what she heard.,,Accomack County,Virginia,Summer,Report 20257: Campers awakened by strange howls while camping near Sanford,37.92735,-75.6561,6/21/2007,20257,Class B,dqdpy2kyv4,82.22,75.155,68.09,54.82,0.58,0.06,0.22,0,0,,1015.53,Clear throughout the day.,11,8.52,299,3.31
"I am a Civil War re-enactor and I was participating in an event on the grounds of Hildene Mansion, which is Robert Todd Lincoln's home near Manchester, Vermont.  We were camped on the front lawn of the mansion, which is bordered on two sides by woods.  The whole area is somewhat off the beaten path, the house is probably a half mile from the main road. In the middle of Friday night, I would guess around 1-2 a.m., I woke up and was walking to the building beside the main house to use the rest room, and as I left my tent and was walking toward the restroom I heard footsteps walking near me in the woods.  They seemed to follow me as I went to the rest room and as I walked back from the rest room they walked back with me to my tent. The whole time walking back I had an uneasy feeling like I was being watched. The next night, Saturday, I was sitting around the campfire around 11:00 pm talking and we heard footsteps coming from the woods which we were right next to, but the noises were coming from inside the woods.  We shined a flashlight on the area that the noise was coming from and it stopped immediatly and as we turned the flashlight off we heard the noises again heading away from us. Both times that I heard the noise it sounded like a large animal and from what I could hear it sounded like a large animal walking on two feet.  While there were other groups at the event I don't think that it was another person as there were trails that were clear that they could have used.

"My girlfriend and I were standing in a graveyard on a ridge top in Eagle Rock, VA. on Dec 24.  It was rainy overcast day at approximately 4:50 pm.   We were paying respect to my families graves when all of a sudden we heard a guttural call sound come from about, what I estimate, 100-150 yards away, if that far up the mountain from us. It was low and lasted several seconds. There were 3 distinct calls in the initial call. My girlfriend looked at me and said, ""what was that?""  I started to answer her with an ""I am not sure"" response when it called out again, 3 distinct calls.  She said, ""is that Bigfoot"".   I said ""I am not sure, I grew up in the woods  and Had never heard anything guttural like that before and I have heard a lot"".  I could see the fear in her eyes.  I looked around and told her, I am not sure what it is but look at all the dogs, they know exactly what it is.  There was a very large dog about 100 yards away over the ridge, that was frozen in place and staring in the direction of the sound.  There were 2 other dogs, one on a chain on the porch of a house and a hunting dog on a chain about 75 yards away from us.  Both of those dogs were frozen in place looking in the direction of the sound.  Not one of the dogs barked.  The hunting dog was the closest to the sound and it was still and quiet. My girlfriend said what do we do now?  Before those words were finished coming out of her mouth, I was trying to make the same sound back at whatever it was but I only did one guttural call instead of 3.  She said oh my God Ernie. It was quiet for 5 -10 seconds after my call and then it responded with another single call like I had just done. I thought I heard something moving. When it responded, a rooster crowed right behind us and then the rooster and chickens with it ran off the hillside behind us.  My girlfriend wanted to leave and go to my grandfathers and that sounded like a good Idea, however; I wanted to see if I could get close enough to see what it was. I convinced her we were safe in the car. So we got on the gravel road that went up to the water tank farther up the mountain, very close to where the sound had come from.  On the way up we  passed the dogs, They were standing still and looking up the mountain. When we got to the water tank I wanted to get out but my girlfriend asked me not to.  I listened to her and frankly happy that I did, since I didn't have anything for protection.  I had the windows down hoping to hear it again.  There was silence and then the dogs started barking at us.   That told me whatever had scared them must have been gone then, so we left.  The hunting dog that was standing still when we went passed it on the way up the hill was spinning around and flipping he was going so fast to try to get at our car.

"It was about 2 a.m. on or about May 3rd 2011, I heard a noise as if something fell that was heavy, a thud sound in the back of my house. I thought it might be a bear or burglar. Me and my 21 year old son went out to investigate. I was armed with a pistol and my son had a shotgun. I saw a deer run as if it was being chased. Then I saw a huge figure coming out of the woods. This thing was at least 8 feet tall. I could not believe this! I screamed out to this thing to stop. It came towards us running. I told my son to shoot. He shot in its direction. It then ran to my left flank and continued to come toward us. We ran back towards the house. I was in terror because the thing was shaped like a man but was covered with hair.

"I had the most incredible thing happen to me on the morning of September 29 2007 in Carroll County, VA. I was driving on highway 94 heading from Fries, VA to interstate 81 in fort Chiswell, VA. I was coming down what is known as Youngblood Mountain, just above the entrance to a fishing hole called the ""Cathole."" it was a very warm and foggy morning. What I saw next completely caught me off guard. As I exited the last curve, I could not believe what I was seeing. Standing on the side of the road was a thing that I had only seen in the movies or heard of through folklore. I was in awe of the thing I was seeing. It was 20 feet from what I know was bigfoot. It, he, was crossing a three strand barbed wired fence in one stride. This thing had to be 7 and a half to 8 feet tall. It walked with kind of a lumber. It never once looked at me, as I had stopped in the middle of the road to watch it walk away. The hair was a reddish brown and about 4 inches long. It had no neck and the smell was that of a wet dog. The arms were very long, about three inches below its knees, but in proportion with its body. I have hunted these mountains for years and had only heard of legends of a hairy beast man and I had never seen anything like I was seeing on this morning.","Virginia highway 94 north of Fries about 5 miles heading towards Fort Chiswell, VA",Carroll County,Virginia,Fall,Report 24325: Four foot high fence barely slows 8-ft creature north of Fries,36.745,-80.48,9/29/2007,24325,Class A,dnwc09hr0h,70.69,55.805,40.92,42.97,0.66,0,0.61,0,0,,,Clear throughout the day.,7,10,45,0.85
"My wife and I were walking down the Great Dismal Trail which is the old Route 17 before they made a 4 lane version between Chesapeake VA and the North Carolina border. We had walked approximately 1 mile down the road and were sitting at one of the benches they put along the way. It was quiet and cool out, around 50 degrees. We started hearing what sounded like someone walking parallel to the canal on the other side. We heard the typical crunching sounds of leaves and twigs snapping. These sounded like the footsteps of a man (as in 2 legged). They started to our right as we faced the canal and in the span of about 5 minutes ended up being in front of us. Once the were near our center, we started hearing steps coming from the left side. We continued to listen as they seemed to be intercepting each other. A couple minutes later we heard what sounded like chattering or popping sounds from the center point and then the same sounds coming from our left. My wife and I were somewhat spooked at this point as we've never heard those sorts of sounds before. I was carrying a small, thick pine branch which I hit against a mile marker post a couple times to try to produce some sort of a response. About 10-15 seconds later we heard a similar sound come from the area of the footsteps but it seemed like it was deeper in the woods. The steps continued and it sounded like it was about to pop out on the other side of the canal. The canal is approximately 40-50 feet across and very deep at that point and the brush on the other side was essentially a wall as it's so dense. We never did see anything but I decided it was time to leave. My wife was hesitant as she wanted to see what it was. We headed back to the gate of the trail and there was a park ranger sitting in his vehicle waiting to close the gates (the trail closes at sunset which is 5:00pm at this time of the year). There's frequent blackbear sightings in this area so I asked the guy how bears typically sound in the wild. I told him about the chattering and asked if they could do that but he didn't think they produced that sort of sound. We talked a bit longer and started towards the car. About 20 feet from the car my wife and I heard a loud but short scream coming from the direction of the swamp. The best we can describe it is a cross between a woop and a woman's scream. My wife thought it was my cars alarm sounding but I said it doesn't make that sound when unlocking the door. I have absolutely no idea what we heard but it was completely unlike anything she or I had heard before.","I don't care if it's posted online, I just don't want to be named or included in any of this.

"I have always known about these creatures but, never really gave it much thought til it happened to me. I was working for a local rancher in Klickitat Co, just NW of Goldendale WA. My boss said that there had been cattle getting out in this pasture land he rented from someone, we keep cattle out there during the summer, and was to feed out everyday at least twice a day, this pasture land was about 5 miles , NW of a once town called Block House . Well he sent me out there to investigate and check the fencing, and find out where they were getting out . So I hop into my truck stretchers in hand and more barbed wire to fix the fence. Once I had reached this pasture land I stepped out of my truck and noticed a strange smell, smelled like someone had just shit them selves .I didn't give it much notice and started walking fence line heading W. I stopped for a cig and something didn't feel right , like someone or something was watching me. I got up and started N on the fence line got half way through checking the N side fence when I saw why the cattle was getting out. There had been a tree thrown through the fence and was down.This tree was about 14 -15 inches in diameter laying where the fence used to be. I thought this was odd, and upon futher noticing, there was a brownish reddish hair on the barbed wire. I have been around cattle all my life and never seen this before, the hair smelled awful. So I finally got the tree moved but was no small chore, it was heavy ever than hell to lift but being 6'6'' 240 lbs I was in good shape .But still it was hard for me move it, but eventually I got it moved. All the time I felt like I was being watched from afar. I didn't like the feeling I was getting, so I quicky mended the fence and finshed checking the fence line on the N side, then turned back to the E, and came down to a small creek and noticed these huge footprints in the still wet mud. They looked fresh like an hour or two old, but the size of these were bigger than mine I wear a size 12 to 13, and placed my foot next to the footprint in the mud, and it was so much bigger than mine . I knew that this wasn't normal cause the left foot where the big toe is looked like it was being dragged . Well this isn't a poss, I thought theres no way a human could make this print it was about a size 19 or 20. I was saying, to myself that I know Shaq hadn't been here cause he's the only human that wears a size 22 triple E so I knew something not human made this. At this time I heard a grunt coming from where I had just been fixing the fence and it had scared me. I walked fast, and I mean nothing short of running flat out back to my truck which was parked about 2 miles away.I got back to my truck and noticed that tools , like shovel, and plastic gas can and empty soda cans thrown out of my truck bed like someone was looking for something or helping me clean out my truck bed. I picked everything up threw it all back in the bed of the truck, and just as I was getting ready to get in, I heard this high piched scream coming from where I had just been so that was it, I was gone. I never heard anything like that in my life. As I was driving back down the road, I thought please don't let that fence break again ,cause I didnt want to have to come back here unless someone was with me. That was the last time I ever went out there. A few weeks later I changed my job and enlisted in the U.S.ARMY, but that day will stick with me forever. People dont believe until it happens to them.  Well, that day made a believer out of me that there's something out there, and if it doesn't want to be found, you're not going to find it,    it finds you .",I know exactly how to get there but I don't remember the Hwy leading W out of Goldendale but stay on it then you come up to block house.

"I am new to the net,found your site in a magazine today at the doctors office.This event takes place about about 15years ago on a hunting trip in the Klickitat-Wahkiacus area of Washington State.Our family has hunted this area for many years on this trip things got a little spookey.There was a total of 7 of us all hunting the same place 2 are now deceased.We started off this saturday morning the second week of October, opening weekend of deer season driving our vehicle down a old abandoned skid trail in the vecinity of the old Woodruff mill,to get into a hot spot where we would park my disabled mother on a stand.When it was starting to get light enough my father and I proceded east from the vehicle to head off on what we called a drive(try to push the deer out of the brush and to my mother). We were walking down the road it was a little soft from the night before rain and dense low fog.W e were loking for sign when we encountered the tracks right on top of where are tires had just rolled something had followed our vehicle.At first we thought it was a big bear immediately we were on alert.As we examined the tracks more closely we determined that bears dont walk on their hind feet for this long of a period of time.There was no front paw tracks!We continued on our drive encircleing the area.On our way thru the thick buckbrush heading west back to the truck we started hearing noises,something was now tracking us.We could smell a strong oder that was like cat urine or a dirty cat box.At this point we were both scared we could hear it smell it but we could not see it.The visibility in this brush was near 5ft.in most places besides the trail we were on where you could see 20ft to the front or rear of you.We started to move faster for the truck as we sped up so did it.The brush behind us was cracking so we took cover behind 2 trees each of us on the oposite side of each other aiming to where the noise was.At this time whatever it was squealed in a high pitch(almost like a woman giving birth)and took off running n.w. of our position.Hoping it was gone and fearing it was heading for mom we scrambled that way.When we got to the truck she was in it with the doors locked.She told us it was N. of her position making lots of noise(thrashing).We went to investigate,we found more tracks and trees about 4inches in diameter were uprooted and thrown down the gullyside,there was no sign of it.We met up with my uncle and cousin and showed them the tracks they could not beleive it.We went back to our uncles camp for lunch when we got there we noticed more tracks it had come into the camp.My cousin is a big guy his shoe size is a 15,these tracks had more than 3-4 inches on him whatever this thing was it is BIG!!

"This is a compilation of experiences over a period of years in the same area (1988- 2009) - feeling of being watched, wildlife silenced, tree breaks, strong smell once, numerous late night vocalizations, rock knocking, things being thrown near our tent and an actual daytime sighting. Some of the things I mention here I didn't know were typical when I was experiencing them, but now do, since I've read other sightings on BFRO's and other sites. My husband and I have been camping and caving in the Trout Lake, WA area for about 20 years and are both very experienced in the outdoors, particularly in the Northwest. We've gone primarily to this area for caving for many years. The first encounter with something unusual was in 1988-89 on a caving trip in this area as we penetrated the forest, heading toward Mt. Adams through some old clearcut to visit a familiar cave. Birdsong of various types is always present, but as we made our way toward the tree line, the birdsong and even insect noise seemed to cease. I looked up, no indication of foul weather or damp wind, indicating rain. Our group ( I think 7 or 8 of us) was familiar with the deep woods and a couple people noted that this was strange. For some reason, we all stopped in our tracks, even though no one had heard anything; everyone was looking around at each other and listening. Something seemed wrong. Then, I had a very strong sense of being watched from further in, not too far away, but did not tell anyone else. I have a feeling the others sensed this as well, and we all pushed quickly on to get to the cave, sticking close to one another. This happened on several caving trips over the years, but not in the same location; the proxmity, however, was fairly close- all within about a 5 mile radius. Another time, around 2002, my partner and I were dispersed camping alone, right next to a very seldom-used forest road in the same area, east of the main forest road. We got out of our vehicle to begin setting up camp as we had done several other times in this area and noticed an almost vomit-inducing stench. It was not the smell of something dead, it was like a combination of sun-baked garbage and feces. We decided that perhaps some local had driven back here and dumped their garbage, but then about 5 minutes later, the smell just went away?? I had no idea about the smells encountered by others at this time, so I blew it off. We walked, sniffing around the area a little and there was nothing, so we decided to camp there anyway, thinking that something must've just been carried on the wind, but it was still strange as to how strong it was. We've also heard some late night sounds when camped at Peterson Prairie many times. Some dismissed them as coyotes. These sounds were like whoops, with several animals at once. I remember silently filing through the animal sounds that I'd heard in the wild: (elk, coyote, deer, cougar, wolf, owls, marmots, bear, human) in my mind and came up blank. Nothing matched. Still we tried to dismiss them as coyotes and went to bed. But it was like something was making the initial sound and the coyotes were answering. But then later in 2003, another type of sound in this area made my blood turn to ice water. It was August, about 11:30 at night at Peterson, as we wanted the ""luxury"" of camping at a site, instead of dispersed, where there was running water and outhouses. We were dousing the fire and about to head into the tent when from the north, about 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile, it seemed, there began a howl. Not a wolf or coyote howl, but it almost reminded me of those emergency sirens you hear in rural towns. The pitch was quite low and then it raised to a higher tone and was held there for about 6-10 seconds, but was still low in tone. I thought about Pavarotti and some very skilled baritones that I'd heard in concert. I came to a sickeningly horrifying conclusion that in all the years of voice I'd studied and heard, not one human had ever uttered something at this tone, nor could they do it at this volume. The lungs of whatever was doing this had to be absolutely huge, and as in the forest, it echoed a lot, but it was *not* echoes that made it sound strange. I looked at my husband, who was also startled and looking at me, and then we looked at some of the other campers across the scrub from us. They had stood up and were motionless, looking back at us, then looking in the direction it was coming from. I asked, ""What IS that?"" to my husband, who said he didn't know. We remained standing and it continued for about 2 minutes, then ceased. In all the years we have camped and caved in that area, (or anywhere, for that matter) we had never heard anything like that. No human lungs were capable of that power. I have pretty much always been a die-hard tenter/backpacker, but that night I couldn't sleep in the tent. I was too frightened with the realization that what I had just heard was impossible- impossible! No creature existed that could make that sound-- unless-- no way-- NO WAY! Then I remembered that this area had quite a few sightings of Bigfoot over the years. I just could not accept it, but I also could not sleep in the tent, so we got our bags and pads and slept in our truck that night. I barely slept, and was very glad to be leaving in the morning! I was shaken for quite a while. We went to the Mt. Adams ranger station in town that morning on the way out and asked if there were any reports of ""unusual animal activity"" the night before. The ranger looked at me like I was under the influence. I never said the words, but I knew she was thinking it. She said she had not heard of any, and by the way, just what was it that I thought I heard? I never answered. Well, terror and curiosity sometimes go hand in hand-- we decided to go back to the area in 2004.  We camped at Peterson, as there was no freaking way I was going to camp dispersed, just the two of us, in that area now. So we're there, visiting our favorite caves in the area and early the last afternoon, my husband and I decide to go cave hunting. (What was I thinking? But it was broad daylight, so...) We trekked down a side forest road that was so overgrown with vine maple and had large tree fall at the beginning so that you couldn't drive it anymore. We bush-whacked through the grown-up vine maple in the remnants of a clearcut and split up and had planned on coming around to meet each other, as we knew this particular forest road curved around a bit. I'd had enough bush-whacking after a while and decided to just meander down the forest road on some more even terrain. So I headed toward the mountain on this road with my husband off in the deep bush to my left. I noticed how warm it was and it was quite still- it was an uncomfortably hot day. Nothing but the sound of my boots crunching on the packed gravel. Then I heard the gravel move behind me, probably about 20 yards. I took my time turning around, thinking that it was a probably a cow, because this was an open range area, and as weird as it seems seeing cows in the forest and clearcut, this was not uncommon at all. It had sounded heavy. Then I felt faint, like I was going blind & seeing colors and shot up with some halucinogen all at once- I watched as a HUGE, hair-covered, dark cinnamon-colored human-like thing cleared the ditch in one stride, glided into the tree line in one more lightning step and then stood absolutely still. There I was, by myself, in the middle of this isolated forest road with a hairy (it seemed almost like semi-glossy fur?) cinnamon-colored shoulder and arm unhidden by the tree it was behind. The shoulder was absolutely massive, as was the arm, which was so long, it was almost as tall as I am. If I look, for example, at the door jamb in my office here, I'd put the shoulder's height at just under the bottom of the jamb. I could see the contour of muscles under the hair/fur. It was obviously very strong. The hair/fur appeared to be about 2-3 inches long. I couldn't see the full hand as it was blocked by some undergrowth. And there it was, standing stock still, watching me- did it think it was fully hidden? I've heard about people being paralyzed with fear and could never imagine that, but that's exactly what was going on. I thought I was going to die very soon. I just really had no idea what was going to happen. I was completely defenseless. I wanted to move, but couldn't, I was frozen. I thought it might chase me if I ran. I could not turn my back on it. Survival mode must've kicked in somehow, because I remembered my training about bears. I began to back away very slowly and spoke very quietly and was even tempted to leave my pack for it. It still didn't move, and just stayed there, still as stone. I must've backed down that gravel about 100 yards and since there was no movement still, I decided to risk it and yell for my partner- there was no other way out of there. I yelled for help at the top of my lungs and he answered, ""Where are you??!!"" I somewhat meekly called, ""Here.."", afraid then that my additional shouting might have the opposite effect of what I wanted and agitate the creature. A few minutes later my husband came crashing through the underbrush, a look of panic on his face. He asked what was wrong and I told him a bear- he looked disgusted and was angry. He asked where and I pointed and it was gone. He asked if it had exhibited agressive behavior. I said no, but he looked worried and started to look around and we headed away from the area. We cut through the vine maple in the opposite direction of my encounter and hightailed it back to the car. As I thought about it afterward, I noted that there was no smell during this encounter to warn me, but there was also no wind that afternoon and it was very warm. It took me 4 years to even tell my husband what I saw. Fortunately, he's a pretty reasonable person and believes (with astonishment) what I've told him. Recently we've listened to recordings on the web of what people think are Bigfoot, and some of them sound just like what we've both heard in the area. The combination of smells, feelings & those sounds never fully registered as being connected until we found some Bigfoot sites on the web. We realized that we've experienced alot of different things in the area that were likely a Sasquatch nearby over the years. In 2009, we camped in Peterson Prairie again, in August. I had alot of reservations about camping in a tent there due to my previous encounter in the area, but I thought with all the other campers around (6-7 sites occupied), (and right next to the obnoxious camp host RV) there wouldn't be a chance. It was raining, which was unusual for that time of year. We pulled into the campground in the evening and set up the tent in the site just north of the camp hosts. We made dinner and called it a night, with it still raining. Something woke me at about 2:30am. It was what sounded like two rocks being knocked together, south of us, down the mostly dry creekbed. I was listening for sounds of clothing, car or camper doors, or soft voices, thinking someone was up really late. After listening intently for about 5 minutes through the sounds of light rain on the tent walls, there were no sounds of ""human"" movement nearby. Then the rock knocking again. Just a couple times. I wanted to wake my husband to have him hear, but the sleeping bags make so much noise and I couldn't be sure he'd be silent when waking, (I also didn't want to risk becoming an item of interest to the rock knocker.) I was then shocked and terririfed by what I heard next. Something ""whooshed"" nearby and then I heard a thud on the ground. I was astonished. What can possibly be moving so fast through the air that it would make a loud whooshing sound? I listened for any sound of leaf noise in case a tree limb had fallen, but no undergrowth impact noise nor leaf noise, as I've heard before, when a limb falls. What could possibly be whooshing so strongly through the air that I hear it and then I hear an impact nearby? Something was being thrown or beaten on the ground. Based on our experience in the area, I was pretty sure it was rocks or pieces of wood. But how freaking big (and close) did it have to be so I could hear the ""whoosh""? That was terrifying. I was literally afraid for our lives, if one of whatever it was hit the tent. I listened for footfalls or scrub noise to see if I could tell if something was coming closer. No foot falls, but another whoosh/thud. I was out of my mind with fear, thinking we'd be hurt or killed by an impact through the tent. How is it that I didn't hear something close by, either breathing or moving? It must have been from quite a distance. I didn't sleep the entire night. My husband woke up around dawn and I was still wide-eyed in my bag. He asked me how long I'd been awake and I told him the entire night. I then told him what I'd heard and he'd wished I'd woken him up, as he believes me about my encounter and actually wants to see/hear one. I told him that I didn't want to risk becoming even more of a target by making noise during the night, so I remained still. We now have a micro camper that we're going to start using to camp/boondock with, as we're both getting older, so a trip down to Skamania/Klickitat County is soon on the books. I'll feel a little safer in it, but you never know how interesting it might look to a night time visitor- I hope not too much so. A parabolic mike and some night vision binoculars might come with us, too.

"I took my friend out turkey hunting near Mt Adams. We went out the evening on the 15th to camp overnight before opening day. We arrived at our camp and got settled in. I got out my crow call and made a call, I had heard a turkey reply so I felt we had a good chance. We woke up about a half hour before sunrise and headed out. As we were walking to our hunting location we heard a tree limb snap and looked to our left, we observed a large dark in color animal walking away from us. I use the term walking because it did not sound like a deer or elk running from us. We wondered what it was and decided to continue on. We got to our area about thirty minutes later and set up our decoys and got in our ground blind. I started to make turkey calls and had heard a few reply. We sat there still calling when we heard this scream. It sounded like a police siren but only the first note. It lasted for maybe a second and sounded like it came from right behind us. I felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand up and looked to my right to notice a dark in color large animal moving away from us in a rather fast pace. It was big enough to move the small trees that were in its way. We immediately packed up our decoys and left the area. I was very confused by what had just happened and did not want to tell people about it. I felt that I would just get made fun of about it. About four months after it happened I talked to the Washington State fish and game about it and they told me that it was a cougar. I have hunted since i was in high school and am now 33. I have seen and heard plenty of animals that live in this state. I am 100 percent convinced that whatever made that sound and was observed by me and my hunting partner was not an elk, deer or bear and was to large to be a cougar.",i was near Mt Adams so I'm thinking it was Adams County or Klickitat.

"I was on my way back from Glenwood where my cousin had had a high school volleyball game; I and her older brother had hung around town well after the game so I left around midnight. On the way back I drove slower than normal because I didn't want to hit a deer with my car I had bought the previous month. I was a little more than two miles from the BZ corner junction when I saw a set of eyes reflecting on the opposite side of the road. I slowed down thinking it was a deer, however as I continued to approach I saw that they were sitting up pretty high. The road dips down on that side just as on mine, there are steep banks here and there. When it began to cross I was a little less than 10 yards from it but through the majority of the encounter I inched towards it to approximately 5/6 yards at the closest. When it came in to the shoulder of my headlights I noticed that the legs weren't thin like a deer or elk they were thick. I thought it might be a bear, however as it continued to cross I could tell it was way too big to be a bear sitting at roughly 7/8 foot high. I also knew it wasn't a bear because bears are meant to be on all fours it wouldn't have ""arms"" that came down about half way down the thigh (I could tell they came down that far because they swing slightly as it walked). When it crossed over the centerline for a moment it made about a quarter turn with its torso and looked at me briefly before turning back (all as it was walking, it didn't stop at any time while on the road). I don't recall much of the face but what I do clearly remember was noticing the shape of the head was not at all like a bear, more like a tall bump off of massive shoulders and that there was no snout (that part I noticed as it finished looking away from me). It continued to walk forward in to a ditch along the road with a steep bank (as it did so walking a little bit towards my car as if trying to step out of the light). It awkwardly turned away and I started driving forward slowly. I ended up crossing halfway into the other lane but I would estimate its distance to the side of my car as I began to pass would have been 3/4 feet at the closest. Once I was pretty sure I had passed it I sped up. I never looked in the rear view mirror, I was honestly too afraid too. The hairs were standing on the back of my neck the rest of the drive. I knew it was watching me as I drove away and the scariest part was I knew it was watching me when I was unable to see it after I passed.",This happened while I was traveling South West on the BZ Glenwood Highway 2 miles from the BZ junction on to HWY 141.,Klickitat County,Washington,Fall,Report 35479: Nighttime sighting by a motorist near BZ Corner,45.86883,-121.4813,9/15/2010,35479,Class A,c21sgwhj29,71.01,64.315,57.62,49.74,0.69,0.32,0.27,0.0004,0.4,rain,1014.08,Mostly cloudy starting in the evening.,6,9.93,254,1.23
"Due to some computer problems, the witness in this case filed his report telephonically with BFRO investigator Charles Lamica.  Below is a synopsis of that interview. About eight years ago the witness and his wife lived in western Washington, near the town of Winlock.  The couple owned several horses and spent a great deal of time riding them on the trails and logging roads near their home.    One sunny afternoon in late spring or early summer they were riding on a logging road in a wooded area when the witness saw what he describes as a “chimp-like” animal cross the dirt road in front of them. According to the witness, the animal was a couple hundred yards in front of him and the sighting lasted only a couple seconds.  He described the animal as “Moving fast, using its arms to help it along, exactly like a chimpanzee does.”  He said the animal was black in color.  Due to the distance and the short duration of the sighting he didn’t get a good look at the animal’s face.  He remembered the animal’s arms were “Long and skinny,” and were much longer than its legs.  He never saw the animal stand up, but estimated that if it stood erect it would have been about five feet tall.  He said the animal moved very fast, “About the speed of a loping horse,” and disappeared into the vegetation on the other side of the road. The witness said he’s very familiar with bears and is positive the animal he saw wasn’t a bear.  He stated, “If this was a bear it was a horribly deformed bear.”  He felt that such a bear would not have been able to move as fast as the animal he saw.   He further stated that bears seen in profile tend to have a rather horizontal back, while the animal he saw had a steeply slanted back due to the arms being a lot longer than the legs.  He related that bears have a noticeable neck, but the animal he saw seemed to have little or no neck. After the brief sighting the couple rode their horses to the spot where the animal crossed the road.  At that point the horses became very frightened and hard to control.  The witness says the horses refused to go further and became so unmanageable that they eventually had to turn around and go back the way they had come.  The witness said he and his wife had ridden those horses on that same stretch of road “Hundreds of times,” and never before or after the sighting did the horses  refuse to move forward.  The witness also related that he has ridden his horses in close proximity to bears and the horses never acted as frightened and unmanageable as when they saw the “Chimp-like” animal. The area where the sighting took place was typical western Washington forest with a lot of salal bushes, large ferns, vine maples, and big fir trees.  The area is generally mountainous, although the place where the animal was seen was relatively flat.  The witness said that when he lived in that area it was not uncommon to hear very loud and unusual howls at night.",,Lewis County,Washington,Summer,"Report 28409: ""Chimp-like"" animal briefly seen by backcountry horseman near Winlock",46.50835,-123.0235,6/15/2002,28409,Class B,c2288d94b8,71.74,61.37,51,49.35,0.72,0.63,0.17,,,rain,1018.42,Overcast until afternoon.,8,9.89,315,2.03
"It was Saturday, 9/14/02, at around 11:15AM while fishing on Riffe Lake.  I had my son and a friend of his in the boat with me.  We had pulled up to a point and shut down to start fishing when I scanned the clearcut like I always do looking for deer or elk.  About 150 yards off of the shore, I noticed something walking.  My first thought was ""it sure is awful warm to be bundled up like that"" and then immediately thought ""your coat sleeves are really long"".  I then said to the boys, ""hey look, a sasquatch"".  They both spotted it and it was walking away from us at a 45* angle looking back over its left shoulder.  It went behind a big stump and we didn't see it for several seconds.  It came out from the other side and stood facing us and just looked at us for probably 30 seconds.  At this point we all got serious because we could tell that it didn't appear to be a human and I know it was not a bear.  It turned and started walking away from us looking back ever so often.  It stopped just before going down a little raven and stood looking at us again.  It went down in the ravene and up the other side then disappeared into the timber.  The boys were very ""excited & nervous"" by now.  We discussed this amongst ourselves and I guess we watched this thing for close to 5 minutes.  I am originally from Arkansas, just a farm boy who has hunted and fished all of my life.  I have heard people talk about these things for years and haven't given them much thought one way or another.  What we saw definetly was not human, it was hairy from head to toe and was large, I don't know how tall.  It walked with long strides and it's arms & hand swung in an long swings as it walked.  At approximately 150 yards, coupled with the amount of time it was in sight, we had a pretty good look.  We are going back to the lake this Saturday and I am going to get out and look around.  This time I'm taking binoculars and a camcorder.  I'm not one to get caught up in myths, but what we saw wasn't ordinary.","There was actually a highway closer than SR 12 but I don't know what it is called.

"My wife and I were wakened by the loudest vocalization I have ever heard , similar to a Peacock but much louder and more timber to its voice , there was no anxiety in its voice not a scream but more of a call , it called about 12 times then went silent I went outside and tried to mimic its call at which time it answered me about 6 times getting closer with each call , close enough that I felt uncomfortable enough to go back inside. I would say it went as far as the edge of my yard where it could have seen me through the trees and still remain unseen.

"Hello I'd like to start out by saying I'm not a believer.  I now consider myself a skeptic.  I started out on 01 Nov 02 on my very first elk hunt.  All my friends told me to go and hunt in Packwood.  So being in the Army I did a good map recon. Talked to the locals and head out for my hunt.  I drove about about 30 minutes north of Packwood on the 02 Nov 03 The day was kinda warm. So I packed light. I had my rifle, pistol and a small day pack with camera. I hiked about 5 hours till I got to the top of the ridge line. Stop for lunch and decided to take some pictures cause it was so beautiful up there.  There where small patches of snow behind rocks and trees where the sun couldn't reach.  As I walked around a big rock I' saw these tracks that took my breath away. Well I'm not one to scare quickly and there is not much that scares me except sharks but after see these tracks in the snow. It made me feal very uneasy. After calming down I pulled out my camera and took these 2 photos the last 2 pictures in the camera. My foot is a 11 regular but the track was about 2"" wider and maybe 3"" longer. After taking the last picture something threw a rock. It didnt push it or it didnt fall on its own it was about 150 meters away but when the rock hit it started alot of other rocks to fall. So I took out my bino's and glassed in the direction the rock came.  I could see what looked like a indention in the rocks. So after I calmed down again I decided to come down off that mountain kinda quickly.  Again I'm not a believe but something spooked me I guess it's the fear of the unknown.  Sincerely SSG Brian R.

"this all started when we were asked to be night watchmen for a logging company to watch the big equipment during the summer months of july and august. it was last week of july when we got there . first incedent we went fishing at the pond there and as we were there for about 1 hour and all of sudden we heard a strange short scream with a deep tone off to one side then behind us was another short scream witch sounded like a responce to the first scream. the sound of these screams startled us to as what this could be. my boyfriend has been a hunter and has lived in around these areas for years never have he or i heard a sound like that. then about 15 min or so another scream back and forth to eachother while we are in the middle then about 7 ducks come out of the bush right at us as more screams were let out by this thing. we emediatly ran to the car and went to drive back to our trailor. another duck came threw the trees and flew directly into the windshield as i kept driving. about two days latter as i was checking the equipment and making sure they were all locked up as i was walking back down the hill the sun was on the back side of this thing. it looked as though something was down in the water drinking i could here the snorkling as i was standing there thinking posible elks but because the fur seemed to be dark and long kind of a burnt red color. as i stood watching this looked to be a huge log standing up with lots of fur. i couldnt move i just froze. i couldnt scream i simply couldnt move. this thing turned and took one huge step over the top of a log on the ground i thought it was coming after me. then i finally started running down the hill to my boyfriend screams coming out of me and then screams coming out of this thing i yelled as loud as i could for him to run to the trailor. we got over by the door of the trailor. my boyfriend was still over by the car he then heard this thing screaming as it was headed toward the trees then the branches were breaking as screams and then screams down behind us we both went into the trailor. i was so scarred i couldnt leave the trailor. my boyfriend went back out side and listened it sounded as though it was done. he came back into the trailor and asked me what i saw i told him this thing it just came out of the ground. he said a bear i said no taller than a bear like andre the giant just stepping over the rope thats how big this thing was 8 or 9 foot tall easy the following morning we went out to look for some kind of foot prints saw a couple about 4 foot split between them. the trees were up rooted some were twisted bend down twisted broken off about 7 foot up the tree . we desided to stay. maybe we could comunicate .... we got comunication by screaming threw the construction cone witch worked almost right away. my boyfriend would scream threw the cone then about 5 min this thing would scream possably 10 yards into the tree line or just very loud. eather way it was the same screams and noises as down at the pond. as days and nights went by my boyf would keep in contact with this thing it would answer all the time when it was close. the twigs and branches we placed in the ground scinny side pushed into the ground the trees were not the branches of the trees around pushed into the ground. we then saw stumps that were completely surrounded by branches and branches weeved into trees and looked to beds we found hand prints where the beds were we found hair trapped into the ground like a straw bed.  other things were happening also but i would like to talk to someone about this ordeal i still have nightmares about this please if you read my story contact me thank you Investigators Addition The following is a narrative based on an interview with the witnesses at their home on 3/15/08. The witnesses arrived at the logging site on July 20th 2003.  Their job was night watchmen over the logging equipment.  It was their responsibility. They were on duty all night. They were off duty during the daylight hours while the equipment was being used. First Site: The first location is where most of the activity occurred.  From the gate the pond is three miles up the road on what they call the Main Line.  The trailer was parked a mile further down the road beyond the pond.  A large clear cut was on the north side of the trailer site.  A road ran north through the clear cut, bending to the east about in the middle.  A spur road extended north from the bend in the road and ended at the tree line. First encounter – The pond. Date: August 1st Time: Dusk Moon: New The couple was fishing at the pond in the late afternoon.  They had been fishing for about an hour when suddenly the first creature screamed, then in a few seconds the second creature screamed.  It was just getting dark.  The witnesses could not see what they were, but said that the creatures were only about 40 yards to each side of them.  The first creature was across the pond to the right side, and the second creature was on their side to their left.  The second creature was just beyond where they parked their car. Not knowing what it was that was screaming, they became afraid and decided to leave.  As they were rapidly trying to get to the car, a flock of ducks was flushed from the brush at the end of the pond where the first creature screamed from.  The ducks were very spooked.  The witnesses jumped into their car and began to head towards their trailer when two very frightened ducks rocketed through the timber between the pond and the road and one actually collided with the driver’s side mirror of their car. Second Encounter – Eyes in the clear cut. Date: August 2nd Time: 12:00-1:00AM Moon: New Location: Up in the clear cut, near the logging equipment, which was parked about halfway between the road and the tree line along the right side of the spur road. Later that night, (after the encounter at the pond) they walked up the road into the clear-cut to check on the equipment.  They took a laser light pen with them.  After checking the equipment to make sure it was locked up, they were looking to see what might be out in the clear cut (like deer, elk, bear, etc.), when they saw three sets of red colored eyes close to the ground, in the open,  just to the left of the spur road.  The eyes moved from the left of the road up, onto the road.  When the witnesses shined the laser light on the creatures, the eyes seemed to bob and weave trying to duck away from the laser light. The creatures stayed close to the ground, with one set almost on the ground, and the other two higher up.  When the laser light hit the creatures, they could see hair about four inches long.  Then one set of eyes rose up to be about six feet above the road. They assumed it stood up.  Then all three creatures turned and walked away, up the spur road to the tree line. At the tree line, they turned left and headed down through the trees. The witnesses said that they could hear branches breaking as they walked. They could also hear vocalizations periodically. It sounded like two people who were very annoyed, and complaining. The screams were short vocalizations, like shouts, and were exactly the same as they heard near the pond. That ended the second encounter. Third Encounter - Whistling, Date: August 2nd Moon: New Time: Late afternoon to dusk Location: Halfway between the pond and their trailer, on the north side of the main-line road. The next day, the witnesses decided to take a walk.  It was late afternoon.  They walked from their trailer back towards the pond and then went up a cat road for a distance. They then turned around because it was getting dark. The boyfriend was getting an uneasy feeling about the situation. As they were walking out, they began to hear a flute like whistle.  When they would stop to listen, the whistle would stop.  When they started to walk again, the whistle would start up again.  What was making the whistling sound followed them all the way back to the main road.  They could not identify what was making the sound. Fourth Encounter – The little one Date: August  6th Time: 11:30 PM Moon: ½ full Location: At the creek which ran down from the clear cut and past the trailer. The female witness went to get water from the creek.  She was up in the clear cut a short distance, at a place on the creek where it was easy to fill up the water jugs.  She was crouching down filling up her water jugs when she looked up and saw two yellowish looking eyes framed by black, shiny skin.  She could see the eyes, nose, cheeks, and forehead.  It was five feet away,but down on the ground, looking up at her.  She said softly, “You stay right there.”, and backed away.  She went to get her boyfriend.  When they came back a few minutes later the creature was gone. Fifth Encounter – The big one Date: August  7th Time: Dusk, 10:00 PM Moon: A little more than ½ full Location: In the clear cut, at the head of the little stream that flowed out of the clear cut and past the trailer. The next night, just at dusk, they could still see well enough to work on their car, which was having problems.  It was about 10:00 PM. There were big black bees that kept them inside the trailer during the day, so they went back out after the bees went away to work on the car. The female witness walked up the road leading into to clear cut to check on the logging equipment and make sure that the doors were all closed and locked.  Having done that, she was walking back towards the trailer, when she heard this “snorkeling sound” over by the creek.  She walked over to take a look at what might be there and saw this big, fur covered butt about 60-70 feet away. At first she thought it might be a bear or an elk.  It was on its knees, bending forward, drinking from the creek.  Then it stood up as if in slow motion.  She said that it looked like a big stump just growing out of the ground.  Then it stepped over a 3 foot high stump.  She said the creature was 8-9 feet tall, and moved like Andre the Giant stepping into a wrestling ring.  She said the hair was a burnt red color with gray tips.  She then ran in fear down towards the trailer, screaming as she ran. She stated that she didn’t know if it was chasing her or not, but she could hear it screaming also. Her boyfriend, hearing her, walked across the road to see what was going on. He said that the creature was moving away, screaming. He said that it threw a fit up in the trees.  It was yelling and screaming, breaking trees and branches.  The screaming was the same sound as they heard down by the pond. This was the first time they realized what they were encountering. Sixth Encounter – Tree breaking Date: August 8th Time: Approximately midnight Moon: A little more than half full Location: 40 yards from the trailer. The same night they saw the big one in the clear cut, they went out to get water from the creek, but stayed close to the trailer, within 40 yards.  They wanted to be close enough to run to safety if necessary.  While getting water, they heard a creature walking in the woods close by.  The boyfriend threw some rocks in the direction of the sounds.  The creature reacted to the rock throwing by violently shaking a small tree.  It shook the tree so hard that it fell over.  This scared the witness, so he fired his one shot into the air to scare the creature away, and yelled, “Stay away!”  At this, the creature went silent and walked away.  After the shot, the male creature made a call from above and behind them in the clear cut.  By this time, they could identify the two individuals by the sound of their voices.  The male makes a louder, deeper call.  The female voice is higher pitched, not as loud as the male, and has a distinctive short howling sound she makes at the end of her vocalizations. After the 5th and 6th encounters, they started walking in the woods during the day, looking for tracks. They found impressions in the moss which were quite large.  The interesting thing about the impressions is that there would be a deep heel print, then an undisturbed space, then the front of the foot.  The stride was 4 ½ feet.  At one muddy bank, the found a track where the sasquatch tried to step up the bank, but it’s foot slipped and made a long five toed slide mark in the mud. They began to find stick structures in the shape of tripods and tee-pees.  There were large ones and very small ones.  The interesting thing is that the structures were made with the tips of the poles inserted into the ground and the root end up in the air.  They found lines of single poles stuck in the ground, tip end down, like trail markers. They found lean-to type structures made against a large tree, and there was what appeared to be a sleeping nest under it.  Inside they found hair, which looks like elk hair, and a full hand print.  The hand print was close to human proportions but dinner-plate large.  They found a log laying on the ground that had sticks arranged leaning on the log at even intervals. The couple constructed their own tee-pee near where they found the stick structures and the sleeping nest.  The idea was to make a structure as a blind, and then hide out in it at night to see what might show up.  They leaned poles up against the side of a big stump and lodged the lower ends into the stump roots.  Then they wove sticks horizontally.  They spent several hours that night inside this blind. After a few hours, with nothing happening, they decided to go back to the trailer.  They said, “I wonder what the sasquatches will think of our structure.”  As they were walking away, they heard one of the sasquatches hoot at them.  They were being watched the whole time.  The next day, they went back to check on their structure, and found it disassembled, and the sticks neatly stacked in three piles. Later, they decided to try to mimic the calls they were hearing.  They used a construction cone as a megaphone, and by making a call while sucking in air, the male witness was able to imitate the calls.  When he called, the creatures would almost always answer. This interaction continued intermittently until the end of August.  The creatures seemed curious about them and hung around at each of the three locations where they camped.  They would hear vocalizations from time to time. They said that it would be what they called the “squawk” call, and sometimes there would be wood-knocks or rock-clacking.  They heard both the male and female. The couple was stationed at the first logging site for about one month before being moved to the next logging site about a mile away. This move happened around the first of September. Second site. The couple stayed at the second site for about three weeks.  During this time, they would hear heavy, raspy, breathing from time to time as one of the creatures walked by their trailer.  There was a lot of human activity at this time.  The sasquatches curious about them, but left them alone. Third site. They stayed at the third site for two weeks. At this site, they explored the woods around the area.  They found stick structures, impressions, and the beds. The end.  The third week of September, they told the logging crew boss about what they had seen and experienced. He was not surprised, but said, “Don’t tell anybody!”.  He said that they were afraid that if it was proven that there really were sasquatches then the woods would be closed to logging. The next day, the witnesses were fired.  They were told that their services were no longer required.  This was supposed to be a six month job. Three days later, while they were in town, the logging company pulled their trailer out of the woods and left it by the highway.",Between the town of Morton and Riffe Lake.,Lewis County,Washington,Summer,Report 22475: Night watchmen at logging camp near Morton describes multiple incidents,46.52352,-122.3045,8/15/2003,22475,Class A,c2308vke4s,67.7,60.745,53.79,51.42,0.65,1,0.62,0.0003,0.31,rain,1019.88,Overcast until evening.,4,10,255,0.87

It only caught my attention recently when i was browsing the bfro site and listened to the puyallup recording and it sounded almost identical to the noise i heard that night in rainbow falls.

"On 11/12/04 my husband and I were hunting in the Mossy Rock, WA area in a clear cut next to a stand of timber, (This was about 6 days after opening day of Elk season.) It was about 0710, and a clear, dry, morning. Rob, my husband, was about 50 yards from me closer to the woods, I was on the upper part of the clear cut, I had heard the tail end of the first scream.  Rob had asked me, ""if I heard that?""(We had ear bob radios on) I stated,""Yes'"" than about 1 minute later, we both heard another Scream! Very close and very Human like.  When Rob reached me, I told him that, ""That! was Bigfoot!"" He said, ""That's what I thought!"" I have seen documentaries on Bigfoot,  however, Rob never has, so he had no idea what Bigfoot might sound like.The area was the 520 GMU, but if you need more info. just E-mail me back.

"Labor Day, 2005, late, late Sunday evening or very early Monday morning. We were camping on the edge of Gifford Pinchot National Forest where some friends keep there horses tied up to ride the Tarbell Trail. I am uncertain of the exact location but could find out if you need me to. There are about 6 campsites and there were about 10 horses with us. We left to go on a night hike and followed a trail down the river, very far down the river where we found a great dark spot in thick foliage to sit and have a beer and watch the stars and throw rocks into the river. As we were leaving we could here what sounded like something following us. We all had lights but could not see anything at all. When we made it back to camp we sat in a nearby clearing and watched the stars some more. The ladies who were at the camp reported someone throwing rocks near them and could here brush being moved around. They ignored it thinking that it was just us guys playing around. We headed back to the tents around 1am and went to bed. Before any of us were asleep that night we heard a screech or scream a few times. We all heard it. Later that morning around 3am we heard it again and it sounded farther off.  All of this sounded as if it were coming from the area were we were by the river that night. Before the sunrise that morning my girlfriend was awoken by a growl that sounded very close to the tent. I just made it home from our trip and listened to the recordings on your site and I can tell you what we heard was the same sound you have on your recordings. I have always belived that they existed however, I will be thinking twice about midnight hikes around Gifford Pinchot from now on. I have heard and read many similar stories and always joked about it. ""Hey! Maybe this time we will see the sasquatch, har har har...""  Well we got to hear it and it was freaky.

I am an avid hunter and spend all year foraging, fishing, and hunting in the NW so I'm very familar with animal prints but this one had me puzzled.  It had the characteristics of a human foot but was twice the width and the toes seemed like they where possibly 3 times the width.  I know everybodies thinking BEAR right know but this was not a bear print.  I've hunted and tracked bears for many years and this was not it.  It was a foot of what looked like a Gorilla or something. If any body has time they should journey on up there pick some Chantrelles and Matzutakes on the way up.","My post left directions to exact spot.  If anyone goes up there to investigate and finds more sign.  Use a topographic map and find the ridge line between both rivers this is where all the elk and big game head when pressured.  You'll need to hike through the dry pine first but as soon as you get above that you'll find one of the most secluded square miles of Adams with small grass fields, downed old growth, and water.  With the extreme dry climate this year this is where all the animals were at or in the lower swampy lands.  and basically a place where an animal could live with almost no interference with man.  Note also you'll need to leave early in the morning for good wind conditions after 10 the wind changes every 5 minutes.  If these creatures are so elusive they have to have a nose on them that could smell dirty socks miles away.",Lewis County,Washington,Fall,Report 15939: Elk hunters finds large human-like track near Trout Lake,46.14853,-121.5775,9/12/2006,15939,Class B,c21w93jfwv,73.03,59.23,45.43,43.16,0.55,,0.69,0,0,,,Clear throughout the day.,0,,303,1.01
"I am not a very good writer. It would be better to talk to me but i'll do my best.  I was road hunting up by doty washington in the woods in an area that had been closed to motorist traffic for the last 3 yrs.  I drove to the end of the road in a small clearcut that had grown up a bit.  Saw nothing, no birds, no animals, no tracks, which i thought was weird, so i was looking down at the side of the road to look on the downhillside for tracks and i saw something black move real close.  Then this thing stood up and looked at me and i stopped the truck and froze. It was realy close like 15 feet on a downhill slope that was steep and this thing was almost at my level. it was very thick and very tall like over 8 feet tall and very broad across the shoulders.  It seemed as nervous as I was. it moved side to side and was moving its arms around.  I then said something like oh my god and then it blew its checks way up and muttered something wierd and i said something i can't remember. then it screamed very loud at me which made me scream if fear and then it turned and stepped up on a stump and jumped downhill. i floored the truck and went back to my son and his girlfriend about 1/2 to 3/4 mile away where i had left them to watch for deer. I was very scared and upset.  I waited to tell them but i was scaring them with how upset i was. so about an hour later i told them. Thats when they told me that they had heard a weird scream from the direction that i had come from.  My son wanted to go look for tracks and i said no but he finaly talked me into it.  So we went back to the spot and it was very dark by now. we stayed in the truck but had every thing off but the lights.  We all heard this thing throwing a fit. sounded like it was hitting things on a tree and throwing whatever sounded like swining a bat against a tree. then we heard it muttering what i can best descibe as mumbled bad japanese. i know its not just using an example to describe the sound, but no yell this time during the muttering. my son's girfriend got realy scared and i was too. so we speeded off and left the area",it was an area that had been closed to motorist traffic for the last 3 years. not sure of the road numbers but I could find it easy if I had to,Lewis County,Washington,Fall,Report 18620: Hunter describes close encounter outside Doty,46.60207,-123.3749,11/18/2006,18620,Class A,c2230e9hsr,47.38,43.91,40.44,38.4,0.92,0.98,0.93,0,0,,1020.17,Foggy in the morning.,1,5.72,154,1.11

"I went on an overnight backpacking trip with my son. We hiked about 4 miles down the trail and then hopped off the trail and down a hill to a small lake off of the trail a ways. We setup camp and then went scouting (looking for elk). We returned that evening, started a fire then went to bed in the tent. At 4:00 AM I awoke to some noise, I always awake easily while camping due to concerns of bears getting into our food. I heard some branches break about 50 yards from the tent and then an extremely loud scream/howl noise I have ever heard. I don't know how to explain it, but it was nothing I've heard before. I grabbed my pistol and flashlight and sat quietly in the tent. After a couple of minutes a heard a couple more branches break and that was it. We planned on leaving at 5:00 am to catch the elk while they were out feeding, but I decided to head out at that time. We packed up our stuff and left at 4:30.

"May 17, 2009 Tonight at the cowlitz barrier dam Myself and two friends where sitting in a drift boat on the south side of the cowlitz river about 150 yrds below the boat launch. At about 8:15 PM On the North side of the river near the top of the cliff A sound very much like a chimp screaming began wailing high on the steep face in very dense brush directly across the river from us. The sound carried on wailing and screaming intermittently  for a minute or more and then stopped. We could not see anything at all making the noise. My partners said they had never heard such a thing before. However I heard the exact same thing a few years ago back behind the Salkum graveyard.

"Live pretty far into the foothills of the cascades near Cinebar, WA. Had a camera (Astak Mole) out on my back porch to capture animals in my yard (for fun in the summer - we see Deer frequently and Bear occasionally). I was laying in bed listening to the audio through the camera (it has a pretty sensitive mic) and heard some odd ""wooping"" in the distance. Luckily a moth or something set the camera off and it recorded two of them. I think I heard about 4 total - two are on the video file I have and will mail it to you. They sound like they're loud but distant (resonates off the hills a bit it sounds like). This was Aug. 27, 2011 at 11:41 PM. Sunday morning, January 22, 2012 got up and looked out my bedroom window to look at the snow (we had almost 2 feet total but it had been raining for days so it was dwindling).  The tracks were starting to really show up as the snow melted - noticed my ATV tracks through the back yard from Monday or so, several sets of footprints from my son and dog, then an odd ""dotted line"" set in between all of them.  Took a picture from my window, went to church, then came back and took more close up shots and measured the distance between the ""steps"" which were between 5 and 6 feet consistently.  They were in a straight line going from one tree in the back of my yard directly to a large tree in the middle of the yard (not around it, but directly to it which I thought was weird) then a set of prints turn right and head to another tree at my property line with my neighbor to the East and don't know where from there.  I also couldn't track the steps out the back of the property - the snow was melted a lot more and there was no obvious direction.  There's a private dirt road behind my property and on the other side of that, acres of trees. On January 27, wondering if this is some frequent path I set up a trail cam on the path and captured what sounds to me like walking up to the camera (the IR's didn't fire due to low battery I think) but the picture's black - but you can take a listen and see what you think...not conclusive, but interesting I think anyway.

"June 2nd saturday my Mom & I wanted to go back to a place that she had done a BFRO expedtion. She said it had been pretty active,& she wanted to show me around in the day light hours.We met 2 of her Big footer friends on the way down. They drove their own jeep. We were going to the last spot that my mom wanted to show me.She said that it was the one spot that she had got creeped out while on the expedition at night. She also wanted to see this road going down to a clearing in the day time. Just after we had gotten to the spot that she was talking about,we heard a really weird loud whistle-whine-gurgling sound in the brush off to the right of us about 60 feet from us. I was ahead of my Mom by 10 feet or so. We stopped because it surprised us & held real still. The sound stopped....we started to walk again & the sound was louder & got more strange.Like a wild pig that was whisteling under water this time.There were also 3 loud human whistles from the other side of the road, up the hill & father away.I wanted to see what was making this sound & was hoping it was a bigfoot!I went closer to the pig sound & my Mom yelled at me to get back to her.2 trees were shaking now around the pig sound in the bushes.My Mom's friends were driving down with thier jeep to meet us & my Mom was flagging them down.I really really HAD to see what it was ,so I ran to the sound.My Mom was really scared & mad at me. But I am glad that I went to the noises, because I got to see what was making it.When I yelled at my Mom that I was looking right at a little Bigfoot,It stopped making the sounds, let go of the trees & turned around(away from me)I think it hit 2 trees with it's hands or fists on the way,because there were 2 very very loud thuds & the trees shook.It moved really fast into the under growth & it looked like it got down on all fours as it ran away very fast & made all kinds of crashing sounds.

"Grande Coulee, Wash -- Mid Aug 2002 Spring Canyon -- Way up in the canyon, there is a densely wooded region behind a dry water fall, in the highest part of the canyon to the SouthEast.  I didn't actually see anything, but having climbed up there to get a view, I was warned in no uncertain terms -- a grunting hum with a stamping of feet.  The Beast inhaled and exhaled with a sound like a large bull.  The animal must have enomous girth, given the sound.  And then total silence.  I altered by approach to the water fall's edge.  I waited, no sounds, no nothing.  I wasn't going in those woods, however. I thought it might be a rogue bull, but given what I've heard about how BigFoot is, how he sounds, the rocky hard-to-get-to area, and the very dense vegatation.  It might be a BigFoot residence.

"It was early November 2002. My buddy and I went fishing on Bingham Creek in the Matlock area. It was in the early afternoon. It was a snowy day, and I was kind of suprised that it was snowing so early. We were fishing in hip waders, my friend was about 20 feet upstream from me when we heard a sound like a huge log being smacked against a tree about 100 yards away from us, I think to our west/northwest. I think the sound of the log hitting the tree was about 3 times, whack, whack, whack. Soon after we heard the same sound coming from about 100 yards away from the first one, and the same distance from us. The area that the noises were coming from were on the same side of the stream that we had come from our vehicle from. I looked at my friend and said, ""what was that?"" He replied that he didn't know. My friend has been hunting all over western Washington since he was nine years old,  and is very familiar with the wild life here and the noises they make, I might add. We didn't think much of it when a few minutes went by and we heard the most eerie growling roar I have ever heard. I really don't know how to describe it, but whatever made that sound was not being as close to as loud as it could have been, and the sound still went right through me. I could feel it in my chest. I was more terrified than I had ever been in my life and I ran to my friend upstream. I don't know which one of us did it first, but we both ended up putting our hands up over our heads and yelling trying to dissuade whatever it was from coming after us. I was more scared than I had ever been. We got out of the creek at this point, and grabbing some rocks headed back to the truck through the woods. I was bringing up the rear and keeping watch as we went. I was much calmer walking back. On the way back we were even joking around about it. Back at the truck I asked my friend what he thought it was. He said he didn't know, but he knew it wasn't a bear, cougar, elk or anything else he'd ever heard before. I never made a report of it before because I just never thought of it before until reading some similar stories on your site. I believe that whatever we heard that day was a sasquatch. My friend also believes what we heard was a sasquatch.","Coming from Highway 101 take Matlock exit,  take a left before the store on a dirt road, go past a house that has solar panels on top, go about 1-2 miles and take a left on the road that goes down towards Bingham Creek.",Mason County,Washington,Fall,Report 9850: Two fishermen hear tree knocking and low roar,47.2055,-123.3958,11/1/2002,9850,Class B,c22k813zvq,58.56,40.44,22.32,18.87,0.44,0,0.89,0,0,,1022.69,Clear throughout the day.,2,10,65,1.42

"actually there is several parts to my report so bare with me.First my background. I am a Mason County resident that has lived here in Shelton for most of my life.My father was a State Fire Warden since the late 1950's up until his retirement in 1978,and my Mother was a floral greens harvester for about 50 years.Consiquently I know this area better than most residents as I also run a business that requires me to be in the woods a lot.I was employed by the USFS from 1970 to 1983 in Fire Management. My first encounter with what I believe to be a Sasquatch was in  October,1984.I was living in Oregon at the time and had came home to visit my folks who resided on the Cloqullam road about 3 miles west of Shelton.One evening as I was sleeping on their couch I heard a screaming noise off in the distance(I am estimating a 1/4 mile)that I can only describe as a cross between a donkey braying,a high pitched scream and a growling noise at the end.What amazed me most was the duration of this howling as it lasted about 15 seconds.About 5 minutes later it howled again, this time much closer to the house and repeats itself twice.I can still recall my parents watchdogs scratching at the door to get in.As the noise got closer I could hear a more distant but unquestionably return answer to the screaming. The thing finally got to within a couple hundred yards of the house and the noise was like an air raid siren.I have never heard any animal as loud as this.It screamed a couple of more times and then it headed back the way it came continuing to scream at intervals until it was a very distant noise and either was out of my range of hearing or had quit.The next morning I asked my parents if they had heard the noise from the previous night.They answered yes and told me that they had been hearing it for years. I did a little checking around the area and found an elderly couple who with a little urging told me of there encounter about a year before that.The couple lived about a mile from my parents place and were in the habit of taking an evening walk up a pipeline which runs betwwen their place and my parents.One evening'as they put it,something tall,large,and hairy walked from the brush across in front of them into the timber on the other side of the pipeline.It walked on two legs,and was not in a hurry but took long strides and crossed the pipeline in about 5 strides.They said it was about 50 yards in front of them and had a very bad odor. Other people in the area attested to hearing the noises.As a prologue to this about 3 weeks later my parent's dog came up missing and I found him on the pipeline.His neck was broken and he was severly torn up.I don't know if this had any thing to do with the noise but I have always wondered. My other encounter was in early fall of 1996.I was out with my dog checking on some leases I had with Simpson Timber Company.After my business was finished I stopped at an area I knew I could find some mushrooms to take home.This is in an area near the Satsop River and betwwen the Cloqullam road and the Matlock-Brady road.It was late afternoon around 5:30 pm and I only had about an hour of light left. My dog and I hiked a short way in from the road and I was down on my hands and knees cutting mushrooms when my dog came over to me and tried to get as close as he could.I was mad at him because he was stepping on the mushrooms.I recall getting a whiff of very putrid smelling air.The smell was overpowering almost like something had died with an overtone of rotting garbage.I stood up to see where the smell was comming from and turned to my right and in doing so saw a large hairy creature standing in a fern patch about 200 feet away.We both made eye contact about the same time and I was so startled for a few seconds I had to rationlize what I was seeing. It stood a good 3 to 4 feet above the ferns and was very dark(although it was late, and this could have made it seem darker in color)It turned its head to look back and then turned its torso and arms and as it did I could see long hair on its arms.It proceeded to walk quickly away.I proceeded to walk out and come home.I didn't tell anyone for a couple of days as I kept going over it in my head to ensure myself that this it what I actually saw and I am positive of the events. I have since then found tracks in the same area which is only about 8 miles as the crow flys from my parents house.",Contact me,Mason County,Washington,Fall,Report 7580: Man shares encounters of an unknown subject,47.2293,-123.4898,11/16/2004,7580,Class B,c22htvv6x5,49.42,41.435,33.45,43.18,0.95,0.77,0.16,0.0035,1,rain,1022.03,Light rain in the afternoon.,1,5.97,205,0.96
"Myself and my cousin were driving to Jarrel Cove on Hartstene Island for a 2 day fishing trip. We had left my apartment in Renton about 7:30pm and headed south to Highway 3 and Hartstene. We encountered 2 deer by the road side.  We crossed the bridge to Hartstene and made the left hand turn to the campsite. I took a wrong turn and had to head back to the camp turn off when I saw a large, black, hairy biped just at the range of my truck's highbeams.  It never turned to face us.  I have seen many bears in the wild and this wasn't any bear. It had a somewhat pointed head, immense shoulders, longish arms.  I would say that it's gate was relaxed but very powerful.  The color in the headlights was a darkish brown, pepper.  I can remember seeing some of the musculature of the upper body.  It's amazing to me that I was able to analyze this all in a few seconds.  It moved up the hillside from the road.  I would say the creature was at least 2.5 meters tall. My cousin really didnt see it and thought I was joking. We went to the camp and set up even in the darkness.  I was still trying to put it all together when I heard the calls.  My cousin was asleep. I didn't feel threatened, I have never heard a call like that in the wild.  I grew up in Idaho and have heard screaming cougars, owls, elk and other creatures, but this was distinctive.  I am certain that no human could make this call.  I will consider myself very fortunate to see another one of these creatures.","On the road to Jarrel Cove state park.

"My brother and I went up to the Lake Cushman   area to look at a house for sale. The house was vacant and it was very quiet. We drove up to the manufactured home got out of the car and was looking into the windows of the house when I heard a high pitched screech yell that seemed to echo from the north side of the hills. I asked my brother if he heard that and he replied no. I said ""listen"", and the same high pitched screech yell occured. It happened again and that is when my brother heard it. It seemed to be far away. There was a small ""A"" cabin next to the property that was vacant and it was very quiet at the time we heard the sounds. No one was around and the sounds seemed to echo. In total there was four of them every 5 seconds or so. Then it suddenly stopped. The time was around 3:15pm and it was overcast. It was very calm and quiet. It was not an elk or a dog.

"I was out on the small lake fishing with a friend and we heard something big running through the water by the shore. It was not a deer or elk as it was running fast and heavy through the water. The ducks and heron in the water flew off and then everything was dead silent.  When we turned the boat around, to go back to shore on the other side of the lake, I looked back into the inlet where we heard the running. I could make out something very big on two feet standing in the shadows of the trees. It was standing up and it was swaying from side to side. I tried to watch it for a while before my friend made us go back. Also my house is not far from the lake and almost every night between 1a.m. and 3a.m. I hear this roaring sound that is not any animal I ever heard and once in a while something answers back.","[The directions to the private were provided in the original submission but were removed before posting, for obvious reasons.

"This incident was originally reported to the BFRO by phone. The witness described a daylight encounter with his son while spotting for deer on private land near the Olympic Mountains. He said he and his son took some photos of the approaching figure with a cellphone. Five BFRO Investigators went to the witness's home to interview him and see the photos.  We spoke with the witness for over an hour, then recorded his full account.  Here is the transcript of the interview. The blurry cellphone photos are shown below the interview, in the Investigator Comments section. These images do not have enough clarity to show details of the figure, but they do show its approximate size, girth, posture and color. --------------------------------- BFRO Investigator: What were the events that led up to this incident? Witness: We came down the road and turned around like usual and we go very slow down the end of the road. As we come down this road, probably at about 150 yards, maybe a little more out in the woods I could see something moving. I didn't know what it was and we went past a few trees and I ask the boy “WHAT IN THE HELL IS THAT?” He couldn't see it, and I drove ahead about another five feet. Stopped the truck and you could see a form coming. I call it a sasquatch. It kept coming. I said “Look at that!” He said “What is that??” “Well I don't know what the hell it is and I don't even have my camera.” Then he said “You do too have a camera – you’ve got your cellphone.” So I took the phone out and handed it to him. By the time he got the phone working that was when picture 1 was taken. It was about that time that it was fifty yards from us.  Then the next picture it was probably thirty yards, for picture 2, and then it turned to its left. BFRO Investigator: Was it aware of you at that point? Witness: It didn't act like it cared if we were there or not, other than it did turn. It was getting brushier between us and it and it turned, then went into an opening.  It came into the opening and then at one point it stopped and turned its head, looking right at us. Investigator: Did it turn its head or whole body? Witness: Well, the whole shoulder part - the front portion. It lifted its left shoulder back and twisted and looked at us. Then it just went right back into the angle it was. Investigator: When it looked at you, what was the expression on its face? Could you see any of that? Witness: I don't know.  It just looked at us. You know – deer-in-the-headlights type of look. Investigator: Did it look surprised? Witness: It looked more like the same as we were, “What are you?  What the heck are you doing here?”   I was just looking at the size of it cause it was ... IT WAS HUGE. I kept asking him, “DID YOU GET A PICTURE???” You know, “Did you get a picture???” (Witness's son).. “I GOT A PICTURE THERE!” Then it just turned back and to the angle it was originally going. Then it picked up its stride. It moved a little faster probably half again as fast as it was going. Then he (the witness’s son) got out of the truck, the boy did. Then it paused, like it was going to turn again and look at us but it didn't. It just turned, I don't know if it went around something or what and he got one more picture. Then it came on the road and he couldn't get one more picture before he left. I don't know how long all that took. Investigator: So it cut across a logging road? Witness: The road runs through there. Investigator: And you lost it once it went across? Witness: It stepped right on the road and I don't think it made two steps.  The first step and then it was standing, stopped right there and it looked right at us. It was standing more upright. The next step it went into heavy brush - just a deer trail or a little path. The brush just closed in around it. I pulled forward and there is another little road that goes down along the way it went and we never did see it again. Investigator: You said it crossed the road, how many steps did it take to cross the road? Witness: One, two it was across because it just stepped in the road and stepped off it. It's a narrow road. It's just a regular Ford pickup so it's the width of the pickup, brush rubs both sides of the truck so eight or nine feet. Like when deer will jump, hit the road once when they are running. It had the same stride as a deer would running - you know jumping through the woods. Investigator: Was there a trail on either side of the road? Witness: I didn't notice a trail where it came from as much as I noticed a trail from where it went. You know where it came from was bracken fern and salal brush. It's up there above my waist. Back here where it came, turned originally in the opening - there was water even then, probably it's a low spot kinda where it came through probably a foot deep or two feet deep from the rains. Investigator: So would you estimate about 48 inches tall for the fern and the salal? Witness: About that tall.  Then it goes in stages but your base layer is at least that high. Investigator: So what we are seeing in these pictures is... ? Witness: Oh his butt was above the brush, it's chest height on me. [the witness is 6 feet tall] Investigator: From that picture it appears the figure is down on all fours. Witness: Don't think so, I don't think the hands were on the ground. Investigator: You don’t think it’s walking with its knuckles? Witness: Everything else moved but the arms didn't.   They were just kind of there. Investigator: So you didn't see any big arm movement, like when a gorilla walks quadrupedally? Witness: I didn't see the arms moving at all. Investigator: So it is walking hunched over but not down on all fours? Witness: I didn't notice it being down on all fours. Investigator: Just looking at the angle the torso is in, leaning quite far forward - it would be very difficult to walk in that manner without falling over. Witness: Well I couldn’t do it.. Laugh.. Investigator: Yeah, that is interesting. Witness: I said it's not like he's crawling over logs or windfalls or anything either. He appears to be more hunched over in certain pictures than when he was walking towards us, but he was still hunched over coming towards us. I noticed as he was coming towards us that he walked from side to side. Investigator: He waddled? Witness: Yeah he swayed or something, like every step he would really make a big step,...you know like a little kid being proud or something... but I know, well you just need better pictures, you need to be there.. Investigator: You needed your video camera. Witness: [Laughing] Yeah - I wouldn't have had these if the kid hadn't remembered the camera on the phone. Investigator: So did you try to look for any impressions or footprints? Witness: No actually, I can say no, I didn't.  The road is pretty hard.   It's all black crushed rock and that's hard as rock. There is nothing there where he came out of.  He didn’t leave as much of a trail as I thought he would coming through the bracken ferns and stuff. That's what I thought. It surprised me, because after he came through there I figured you'd see a trail, as even brush pickers and mushroom pickers coming through you can see they're leaving trails. You know breaking them away, and there wasn't one. It was hard to see where he came out on to the road vs where he went in. He went in on a regular old deer trail & where he came out, it was almost undisturbed. That surprised me as a matter of fact. Places I went in there I left more of a trail in the bracken ferns than he did. Investigator: What time of day was this? Witness: It had to be around 10:00, 10:30. Investigator: In the morning? Witness: Yeah Investigator: And it's on the 16th of November (2007). Witness: Yeah a week ago Friday Investigator: There weren't any other cars around? Witness: No, there was nobody else there. Not where we were at.  Matter of fact, I didn't see anybody out there.",A logging road in Mason county.,Mason County,Washington,Fall,Report 23160: Daylight encounter with two hunters south of Union (w/ cellphone photos),47.49865,-123.2182,11/16/2007,23160,Class A,c22qhng5xy,49.28,44.465,39.65,44.27,0.96,0.93,0.22,0.01,1,rain,1010.69,Mostly cloudy throughout the day.,1,9.98,185,1.69
"My husband and I had just arrived at our cabin on Harstine Island and were unpacking the car.I cam out of the cabin and heard what I thought was a howl at first. I stopped to listen. after the next vocalization I said to my husband it's Bigfoot and he stopped to listen. We could tell they were coming from far away. Maybe 1/2 mile to a mile south of us. We did not feel threatened or scared at the time. The sounds were deep. Something between a roar and screem. They had a very deep growly under tone. In between sounds my husband was disagreeing with me. He suggested it was an elk or coyote. Our dogs both became clingy and started whining, so I had to bring them inside so we could hear. When I came out I started counting how long the sounds were. I counted 5 seconds. My husband said that while I was in the house there was one about 3 seconds longer or about 8 seconds. The sounds were deep but some of them changed pitch going even lower midway through. What ever was making the sounds had much larger lung capacity that even a big man. That is what finally convinced my husband it had to be a big foot. All other animal calls we have heard go higher rather than lower. The sounds contined for about 5 minutes. The next night my husband tried to recreate the sounds at the beach and couldn't even come close to the deep pitch or that length. His comment was that what ever made it was not human.",We were in Hartstene Point. The gated community at the north tip of the island. The sound was coming from the south.

"Over the Labor Day weekend 2010 my girlfriend and Newfoundland dog were camping at Lake Cushman, WA at the upper Camp Cushman campsite.  We had dinner, an evening walk and then to bed in our seperate tents.  I was cuddled up with my dog when all of a sudden a very loud earie whooping call burst through the quiet night, awaking me and the dog.  My dog growled and flipped himself over & broke the tent pole. He was very agitated, nervous and couldn't calm down. The whoop sounded longing, lonely or lost in tone.  It was definatly a female tone, the whoops went ""whooop whooop whoop, whoop whoooop.."" then would stop for about 15-20min, then again ""whooop whoooop...."" on and on for about 2.5 - 3hrs.  The noise came from up above the campsite away from the Lake.  It sounded really close but could tell it was far away, perhaps about 1- 2 blocks away.  It was difficult to tell due to the woods, lake and projection of the very loud voice.  I thought it could be an owl but no owl sounds like that, then I thought maybe an Elk but once again I've never heard an elk like this before. I couldn't go to sleep that night due to my dog wouldn't calm down, he was on alert all night until it finally stopped. I was petrified and was up all night wondering if this creature making the noise was coming to visit us in our tents. When I woke up my friend had heard the same noise and wondered if it was an injured dog howling but then when I mentioned sasquatch whoops she had an Ah-hah moment and realized no dog could make this noise. Others campers gathered in the AM discussing the mysterious noise, some said it was a bard owl, spotted owl, a coyote, an elk, but I felt in my bones it was the same noise I had heard from a recording on BFRO site (1974 Ron Morehead Sierra Nevada whoops & knocks) Camp Cushman is most likely being closed due to some lawsuit w/the native americans over land use.","Lake Cushman ( Camp Cushman campgrounds, the upper campsites)",Mason County,Washington,Summer,Report 28207: Campers at Lake Cushman hear possible vocalizations,47.46872,-123.2259,9/4/2010,28207,Class B,c22q5cmtk6,63.67,55.115,46.56,49.95,0.8,0.67,0.86,0,0,,1017.67,Mostly cloudy until evening.,5,9.96,241,0.72
"One summer night in 2008, I was sitting on the back deck with our dog Icy at about 1 in the morning, because it was too hot to sleep. It was totally silent -- which it normally is around here at night -- and as I sat there on the wooden steps, with Icy sitting on the deck about 3 feet away from me, I heard what at first sounded like a distant siren, seemingly from the north-north-east. (The only thing in that direction from our house is Dow Mountain, with no roads except for dirt logging roads).  Icy's response to sirens is invariably the same: he lifts up his head, pricks his ears, listens intently, and then begins howling, usually in the moment just after the siren becomes inaudible to my human ears. That night, though, his response was completely different. He came quickly to my side and pressed himself against me, sort of hunching himself into an extension of my body. As I listened, I viscerally ""knew"" that what I was hearing was NOT a siren, although it did seem very, very similar to a siren sound.  I remember I was holding my breath -- and my impression was that I didn't start breathing again until the sound had completely stopped -- and I can only hold my breath for about 50 seconds, so that's the amount of time I would guess the sound went on.  The same instinct that told me that I was not listening to a siren also told me that I had never heard this sound before.  Another -- to me -- validating aspect was that my own response to it was out of character, just as Icy's was. Normally I would have sat there for another hour or so, hoping to hear it again. It was so amazing -- and I usually can't get enough of that kind of interesting mysterious stuff. But when the howling ended and I started breathing again, my first impulse was to get inside the house, quietly and fast.  I went online and Googled every kind of indigenous Pacific Northwest animal I could think of: elk, fox, coyote, deer, bear, rabbit, moose, cougar, various owls, other birds -- even wolf, which we purportedly do not have in this area -- and couldn't find any WAV file that even came close. On a chance, I looked up Sasquatch WAV files, and listened to the ones that I could find -- I think there were five -- and one of them, the ""Ohio Howl"", was a dead ringer. When I heard it coming through the headphones, chills started running up my back. That was the sound I'd heard.","Approximately 300 feet from Highway 119, and approximately 1.5 miles northwest of the Foothills Park area.",Mason County,Washington,Summer,Report 28487: Possible vocalization heard near Lake Cushman and Dow Mountain,47.41995,-123.2005,1/11/2011,28487,Class B,c22mu881hr,33.99,31.925,29.86,24.42,0.81,0.43,0.23,0.0008,0.37,snow,1020.38,Foggy starting in the evening.,1,7.96,35,0.28
"On Friday the 5th of November 2010, my family and I decided to go hiking near Lake Cushman. I typically go hiking alone as it gives me opportunity to gather my thoughts and enjoy the outdoors. Seeing as how my wife’s birthday was coming up she managed to convince me to take her and our two children along. I had planned a more arduous hike near Mt. St. Helens but given the children’s notable lack of ambition and current weather conditions I elected to drive the hour and a half from our home in Castle Rock to Lake Cushman for a more “family friendly” outdoor experience.  We arrived at the Big Creek trail near Hoodsport at around 1000 hours and began our hike (trail 827.1 loop). It was a cool day with a light drizzle and visibility was at times no more than 75-100 yards. The hike was rather uneventful and my wife and I both noted that the utter silence of the forest that day was deafening. There was one other car at the entrance to the park so I just assumed they had gone in ahead of us on the same path and had ruined our chances of viewing any wildlife. At around 1130 hours I heard a truck about 75 yards up the ridge. I looked up just in time to see the cab lights of a logging truck heading up the mountain on road 2419. About 10 to 15 minutes later I heard what I initially thought was another vehicle struggling to climb the road. A couple of seconds later I realized it wasn’t a car at all but an animal or possibly another person. It sounded like part howl and part groan. It was difficult to describe other than to say it seemed mournful. This groan/howl lasted about 8-10 seconds during which time I turned to look at my wife and children. The look on their faces said it all. They had heard it as well. Almost simultaneously everyone said “what was that”. I said I had no idea and we continued on. At around 1200 hours we approached the Skinwood Creek Bridge. All at once we were stopped dead in our tracks by a horrible odor, which I can only describe as a cross between skunk and ammonia. The odor was so heavy we could taste it and our eyes even began to water a bit. My daughter began to cry and repeatedly begged me to let us return to the truck. I must confess I would have liked to oblige but we were at the half way point and continuing forward seemed to be the most logical course of action. As we continued on the odor dissipated. We made the turn at the bridge and started back down the trail on the west side. At almost the same point we encountered the odor on the east side of the trail we picked up the scent again on the west side. We continued down the trail and once again the odor dissipated. The remainder of the hike was uneventful and I dare say we made much better time heading back to the truck.",Olympic National Forest just East of the Mount Skokomish Wilderness on Big Creek Trail 827.1,Mason County,Washington,Fall,Report 28485: Possible daytime encounter by a family hiking near Lake Cushman,47.29435,-123.1267,1/25/2011,28485,Class B,c22mn1tvec,47.93,43.045,38.16,43.15,0.94,0.88,0.72,0,0,,1027.17,Foggy overnight.,1,8.9,203,0.55
"Every year for the past 20 years i have been going my family has a deer hunting camp outside of Winthrop, WA.  We stay near Falls Creek and not in a camp ground, but up in the hills.  The nearest hunter to us is probably 5 miles away.  It is always a good time. In October of 2005, this last hunting season, we had a stange experience.  My friend and I were walking down an old logging landing down to a creek bottom.  We were talking and weren't being very quiet.  When we got to within 50 yards of the creek, we began to here rocks being smashed together repeatedly. The sound was definitely rocks being slammed together, and it was loud.  We figured it was right in front of us about 50-75 yards away.  Our first thought was if it wasn't a man how could a bear slam rocks.  We figured they would roll them over to look for food or something and wouldn't be able to hold them and slam them together at some points 4-5 times in row. There are no trails or roads to this creek.  You have to walk through thick timber to get to it.  Since we were the only hunters in the direct vicinity, we ruled out it was a person doing it.  We could barely see anything down at the creek from where we stopped walking cause the timber was so thick.  We walked a little closer to see if we could see anything and the rock smashing started up again.  We thought it was time to leave and as we walked back to camp it stopped. The next morning we set out the opposite direction from the rock smashing of the day before. We went up the mountain this time, through a creek draw.  I was on one side of the draw walking the edge as my friend was walking on the other side.  The draw was wide enough to not hear each other when talking so we used radios.  About 1/2 mile from the experience we had the afternoon before my friend radios to me as says he hears something and had a unnerving feeling something was following him just above him on the treeline of the draw.  He could not see anything nor could I. He walked down into the draw and up to my side.  We walked up the draw together about another 20 yards when we began to hear what sounded like 2 large sticks being slammed together about 3-5 times in repetition.  The higher we walked the more we heard it. We could hear it parallel to us across the draw. After a few minutes we heard it parallel to us and then right away another set of stick slamming sounds came from about 100-150 yards just ahead of us on our side of the draw. We know we were being followed by something and there was more than one.  Afer that we turned around and left.  We left for home the very next morning.",,Okanogan County,Washington,Fall,Report 13487: Possible stalking of deer hunters near Falls Creek,48.45809,-120.1611,10/17/2005,13487,Class B,c2de9tt2g6,70.96,59.915,48.87,41.84,0.5,0.79,0.51,0,0,,1010.06,Mostly cloudy until evening.,2,10,179,2.42
"I was one of the leaders for our church Boyscout troop along for our annual week long campout high adventure. We arrived late morning July 31 at the Summit Lake Scout camp at the summit of Disautel pass located on the Colville confederated tribes reservation this is just a short ways off state route 155 in between Nespelem and Omak. I would like to give you as much information leading up to the incident of the evening of August 1st as I believe they are all related. After arriving and getting the lodge setup. We decided to take a hike. Though we had some planned hikes loaded in our handheld GPS we decided to just pick an open ridge about two miles distant and hike up to it sticking to no trails or roads just bushwacking. We had to skirt a logging operation which was clearing some thick timber on some very steep slopes using helicopters, to ferry the logs down the slope to more accesable sites to transport it. There was lots of fresh bear sign as there were wild Blueberries and huckleberries on the lower slopes. The next morning we planned a hike to a lake about 6 miles from our camp the lake is called grant lake I believe? We hiked south down SR 155 to the coyote creek camp ground then to the right down the asphalt rd about a mile into an area where we were supposed to have a permit to enter. We had the coordinates for the lake loaded into the GPS so we just went cross country until we arrived at the lake it was about 2 miles from the coyote creek camp ground. It is a small crescent shaped lake there was an old hunting camp with a tipi frame and an old travel trailer at one end. We spent the day napping and talking and the boys swam in the lake and ran around as boys are want to do. It was a nice day we had decided to camp overnight, we had no fires as the area was quite dry. The only wildlife I noticed was a family of Lesser Scaup ducks and a family of Canada geese on the lake. No fresh deer sign there had been some cattle in the area fairly recently, but we saw no cattle. Around dusk I decided to take a walk up on a rocky ridge a couple hundred yards north of the lake to see if I could get cell coverage to call my wife. As I left the boys were taking an old smoking rack apart and breaking the 3-5inch diameter lodgepole pine logs that it was made of against a tree most of these were rotten so they broke fairly easy but they were making quite a racket. When I reached the top of the ridge I could hear the sharp cracks as they struck the small logs against the tree. I walked back around the opposite side of the lake back towards our camp keeping an eye out for bear as I know they would start to move around dark as it cooled down, though with the boys so noisy and it being drier at this lower elevation ( not many berries at all) I doubted there were any around. But I felt a little uneasy for some reason?? So I headed back to our camp. As I approached the camp just before dark I smelled a musty smell like a pack rats den but stronger one of the other leaders commented yeah there is definately a skunk around. But it wasnt a skunk smell not that pungent just musty. So anyway I'm getting to the incident. We got the boys mostly settled and lights out in their sleeping bags about 10-11:00 O'clock I would guess. Shortly after they quieted down there was loud two part call with tremendous volume it was not man made it stated out lower then went to a high crescendo then followed by a shorter lower call. It did not sound like any of your recordings the closest sound I have found on the internet is the call of a male ibbon I believe some kind of Ape. It whatever it was repeated this call three or 4 times and got futher away each time the sound came from a draw at the north end of the lake where the soil was moist and there was fairly thick brush. I spend alot of time outdoors hiking hunting, and fishing. I have never heard anything like this sound. We had to help one of the boys who had found a leech on him. This was a few minutes after the call.I asked the boys did you hear that noise. They all said yeah what the heck was that. I said I have no idea never heard it before. A couple of the boys joked maybe it's bigfoot. I never really put everything together until later when I got home and the boys comment got me to thinking about the bigfoot possibilty. So I searched the Internet for bigfoot sounds and found your sight. After reading most all of the accounts there are some things that many of the other sightings include. I believe with the logging going on maybe this animal whatever it was was displaced from the thick timber up higher maybe it was attracted by the boys cracking the logs aginst the tree, and the musty smell shortly before the call. This call was very load and powerful and clear.",At Grant lake a small Lake on the Colville Indian Reservation,Okanogan County,Washington,Summer,Report 17570: Possible vocalizations directed at camp of boy scouts near Omak,48.32956,-119.187,8/1/2006,17570,Class B,c2e4zy4sjd,74.01,60.92,47.83,36,0.42,0.02,0.23,0,0,,1013.3,Clear throughout the day.,9,7.66,249,0.69
"This hunting season we went to the same place we go every year up Falls Creek Road out side of Winthrop.  This is the same place we had rock smashing and wood knocking the year before as I explained in Report # 13487.  This year we walked down towards falls creek to check out the area we heard rocks being smashed together the year before out of curiosity.  The natural trail that was formed by cattle and deer follows all along the bottom and we use it to walk the bottoms near the creek.  3 of us walked down and as we walked the trail every 10-30 yards were fresh trees broken over at about 5 to 8 feet.  These trees were anywhere from 6 - 15 inches in diameter.  Something would have to have a lot of strength to pull down and snap and have to be quite tall to grab as well.  They were all fresh.  These were not wind falls or caused by snow.  I can tell the difference.  Normally there are a number a trees that are snapped by snow or fallen over by wind.  These were random along a trail and where there was a break another tree next to it was fine and probably more susceptible to wind or snow.  When we got to the creek at about where we thought we heard the rock smashing from the year before you could see the trail continue on at the other side of the creek as if this was where all the animals crossed the creek at.  2 trees at about 5 feet apart on either side of the trail were both twisted over at their tops.  We also had what looks like foot prints coming out of the creek.  They were coming out of the creek on a small incline up to the top of the bank.  They were about 13-14 inches long and the stride was 4 to 5 feet apart.  I am 6' and it was hard for me to maintain that stride.  There were 4 prints in total.  Some better than others depending on the terrain.  It was right next to the creek so it was very hard and rocky.  However, all of the prints were deeper than my boot could make.  Something definitely heavy made the prints.  What was obvious was on all of the tracks the toes were very visible and were very wide at the front and the big toe was to the inside.  Being on an incline more of the weight was on the front and less on the back however a heal could be easily scene.  It definitely was not a bear doubling up the tracks.  We see bear prints all of the time around this area and these were nothing like this. It was raining when we discovered the tracks so it was hard to tell how old they might be.  My Dad, my friend, and I are convinced there is something unusual hanging around where we camp given last year and this year.",[Location specifics removed],Okanogan County,Washington,Fall,Report 16631: Hunters find possible footprints and possible tree breaks near Winthrop,48.45809,-120.1611,8/19/2006,16631,Class B,c2de9tt2g6,91.55,78.845,66.14,33.35,0.22,0,0.87,0,0,,1013.17,Clear throughout the day.,7,6.8,193,0.86
"Two weeks ago my and my girlfriend were out hunting when we seen something running down the road. it was large and hairy and moved like a mother [It moved fast]. We seen it about 40 to 30 yards away and were already driving kinda fast. I am guessing about 15 to 10 miles an hour. My girlfriend ask me ""what is that"" I looked to see a hairy head moving along the road. I drove up the road toward the place it was seen. when I reached the place it was already gone. I grabbed my pistol and jumped out to look up the ridge in the direction it was running, nothing, no noise, nothing. My girlfriend was scared and yelling at me to get back in. Most of the time you hear something running away or hear the hops of a deer running hard, but there was nothing. I backed up the truck to look at the road where it had run and it left no track what so ever. if it was a bear it would have left it's claw print in the hard surface sand. but there was nothing and I looked well. I could see how a big flat foot would leave no print. I asked her what she saw and she said it looked like a large man, she was sure it was a man type animal. you have to take into consideration this all happened in a matter of about 3 to 4 seconds, I mean the first sighting to stoping the car and jumping out. so it all happened fast. so you can guess that puppy was moving. and it was in a place he could not hide to well, no real buck brush or anything.",Hwy 155 from Omak and off on side roads.,Okanogan County,Washington,Summer,Report 15135: Dusk sighting by a couple near a spring outside Omak,48.32956,-119.187,9/28/2006,15135,Class A,c2e4zy4sjd,79.04,63.33,47.62,44.04,0.56,0,0.2,0,0,,1017.74,Clear throughout the day.,4,10,295,0.33
"My husband and I had been cutting firewood just off a mountain road. I was busy cutting off knots from the already cut chunks of wood and my husband was running the noisy chainsaw. Over the noise of the chainsaw I heard a loud snap (brush) and looked over in the direction it came from and saw nothing.  I had seen cattle in the area just prior to that but they all ran off when the chainsaw started.  No cattle in sight.  About an hour later I went over to the pickup truck to get a drink of water and started hearing noises I've not heard in the mountains before.  I was raised deep in the mountains so am very familiar with forest sounds. On the other side of the roadway is a heavily wooded and deep canyon.  From that direction I heard a ""knocking"" sound.  Not a woodpecker as this was slow and not too loud.  Then I heard a soft whistle and what sounded like a parrot or mynah bird when it's trying to learn to talk.  Just kind of ""gibberish"", then the knocking and the soft whistle.  Again, I've heard all kinds of sounds in the mountains, having been raised there, but nothing like this.

"I am new to hunting but I have spent my whole life hiking in the woods.  This potential incident happened on a deer hunt.  After seeing a herd of does, I found a buck trail leading uphill.  I followed the buck trail trying to find sign like, feces or tree marks.  I would come across some fresh buck feces every hundred yards up the saddle between Chopaka and Hurley mountain.  I saw buck sign everywhere, I marked it with a buck tarsal scent gland from a fresh deer kill from my friend.  I continued following the buck trail and signs up some very steep country with lots of boulders and dangerous rock fields.  I finally found and spooked whatever I was following; I never saw it but it stormed off over a rock field before I could get sight of it to shoot.  I am assuming it was a buck or sheep or mountain goat.  The fresh deer sign ended here and I decided to continue up, following old deer sign and camp.  It got very, very steep; I climbed approximately 2000 foot of gain to about 3/4 of the way up the saddle.  I was too tired to reach the top of the saddle, so I camped on the back side of a large tree in the midst of boulder fields.  There were many berry patches with thickets hard to pass through.  I built a soft bed for my sleeping bag and built a fire.  I saw a large pile of droppings that were black with lots of berries in it, probably bear; they were not round balls like the deer droppings I had encountered before.  I used a deer call throughout the day.  Sometime after the sun set, maybe 2 hours I heard a frightening scream come from the top of Mount Chopaka.  I had an excellent view of the snow covered peak from my slope side camp.  I have never heard a sound like this.  It was only one guttural scream.  I can describe it as a Pterodactyl (flying dinosaur) cry from a movie.  It had an extremely loud volume.  I slept with my .44 magnum ready for the worse.  Nonetheless, I didn't sleep well that night. A week or so before this incident, me and a buddy were hunting in Chinchelo Creek of the Sinlaheikin (wilderness area), which connects to the same woods as Chopaka.  We were using a dying rabbit call and we were sitting on logs waiting for a bear to come out.  We both heard a soft yet loud hissing sound pass behind us like a shadow.  We saw nothing, it was eerie almost as if a ghost had passed behind us. I also saw a shadow out of the corner of my eye as it passed.  This was very creepy.  Neither of us have heard anything like this before.

"My father, grandfather, and myself were on a fishing vacation that spanned many areas in the northern part of the state of Washington.  One of our pit stops was at one of our favorite lakes, Lake Chopaka where the trout are huge, hungery, and numerous.  I was out on the lake with a tired arm and a grumble in my belly so I slowly headed toward camp. I arrived at camp and fixed myself a sandwich, the time is around noon.  As I sat and ate my sandwich I scanned the lake to figure out where I would fit amongst the other anglers when I returned to the water.  About halfway through my scan, my eyes stopped on what I thought was a guy trying to get cell phone service (yes the giant phones of 1996 did kinda work at the top of the small hill) on a little hill directly across from the boat launch.  Upon further examination I thought it was odd that the person was wearing a fur coat.  At this point I went into the camper to get some binoculars so I could get a better look at the ""bear"".  Upon even further examination, this time at 12x zoom I thought it was odd that the bear had really long arms, walked on two legs just as easy or more so than myself, and had a relatively short head with ape like features for a face.  I watched for probably five minutes or so as the creature lurked around the tree line at the top of the hill, and just like that it stepped over a fallen tree and disapeared into the shadows of the trees.  Confused and thinking myself delirious from the ravenous hunger developed from a long morning of hauling in heavy trout, I placed the sighting in the back of my mind. Out on the lake again, I was prepared just incase the ""ape bear cell phone guy"" showed it's self again.  Sure enough at about 1300 (1:00pm) or so movement caught my eye near a copse of trees by a rockslide on the bigger hill across the lake.  I gave it a good look at 12x and sure enough it was the same thing I saw about an hour before.  And after about 2 minutes it disapeared from view into the copse of trees it was lurking near.  My dad asked me what I was looking at and I told him ""Sasquatch"" and he gave me a head shake and said I was crazy.  So here I am now writing to you, the only people I have told this story to other than my dad, about the 6.5' to 7' tall, dark reddish brown fur covered, bipedal, short headed, ape faced, no necked, long armed, NOT A BEAR!,  sneaky creature that I saw at Lake Chopaka on 23rd, May 1996 at or around noon and again around an hour later.","From Loomis head north on Loomis-Oroville Rd. turn west onto Toats Coulee Rd. follow around until road heads south, turn heading west onto Chopaka Mt.

"On Wed. 8/17/11 my family went camping in Okanogan County, Washington near the town of Conconully, WA. We arrived around 4:00 p.m. at the Salmon Meadows campsite. We checked out serveral sites and picked the one nearest the meadows, we were the only ones at this campsite. We went for a hike and got back to the campsite. There were numerous range cattle in our area. After hanging out at our site we heard a strange howl yell down in the creek bed the sound repeated 2 or 3 times, we were about 40 feet above the creek bed, we went down to take a look, we thought that an animal had injured itself. We found a young cow on the other side of the cattle guard. We opened the barb wire fence and tried to herd it to the other side, but it wouldn't go. We put the fence back up and went back to our camp. That night I woke up many times, thought I heard something and tried to see if anything was there in the full moon light illuminated meadows and forests. Our dog didn't react so I fell back to sleep hoping for morning. We woke up to some howls down in the creek bed below us. We had a video camera and tried to catch some of the howls on tape. We got 5 clips with the howls as they moved further away. I will email the best one after I submit this report. We tried to follow the sound away from us but it moved too fast, and our son was still sleeping in our campervan. We went back to camp and didn't hear or see anything else.

"What happened to me occurred at my favorite fishing spot on the upper Conconully Lake near the town of Conconully Washington in Okanogan County. The incidents I am about to tell you about happened on 3 separate visits to this spot but they were in a row. The first time I was fishing and had been there a a couple of hours when across the lake I heard several knocks on trees. I looked for up towards the area they had came from and saw nothing.  The hill side has a lot of trees on it and is very steep and no roads on that side of the lake.  On my next trip to same location had again been there for a couple of hours when I heard a big splash from a very big rock landing in the lake several feet out in the water.  The rock came from the same area I had heard the knocking on my previous trip.  I looked the area over to see if I could see where it had come from and if anyone or thing was in the area. I could not determine where it had come from but it had to come from up the side of the hill.  I could see no one or anything else in the area.  I thought to myself that maybe a bigfoot could have tossed it into the lake cause I could not see any man doing it, as it was just too big a rock and it was thrown too far out into the lake.  On my third trip back to the same location my son Robby was with me.  I had told him of my last two visits to the location and what I had heard and saw.  We spent the afternoon there fishing without incident and were packing on our gear to leave when we both heard up behind us, rocks come rolling and the sounds of something very big moving across the hill side above us. It made both of us a little unnerved.  We did not see anything but it was not something we had heard before. It was not a deer as I have seen them in the area before and they had not had any trouble with the terrain and it could have been a bear but I have not seen any bear in that area before. What ever it was that caused the rocks to slide was big and moving at a pretty good pace. It was too far up the hillside for us to see.  Each time I was there the weather was fine and it was in the early spring. It is a great place to fish and I will continue to go there.

"My friends and family and I were Kayaking across Sullivan Lake in North Eastern Washington. We had spent the entire day slowly making our way around the side of the lake that is unpopulated (there is a highway on the opposite side of the lake). We ""beached"" at the far end of the lake where there was a small campground/swimming area, and it was there that me had lunch and let the teenagers swim and mess around. All of the adults felt very uneasy as if we were being watched and we made sure we kept the families close together. When we had to use the out houses we walked together and returned quickly to the beach. As we were beginning to leave the beach several of us noticed a rope swing on a very steep bank of the lake only about a hundred yards from the swimming area. I was among the last ones into a boat so by the time I came to the area of the rope swing, the others had already passed it and were quite a ways ahead of me (approx. 200 yards ahead). I was just daydreaming and enjoying the scenery,  ( and to be honest with you glad to be away from the uneasiness that I had felt at the beach )when a movement caught my eye near the rope swing. AT first I couldn't focus on what it was and it took me a moment to realise what I was looking at. There next to the rope swing on a stump sat an old man.He was very tall and dressed in grey from head to foot.( My own father is 6'6"" and I remember thinking to myself that this old man must have had him beat by at least 10 inches!) His legs were crossed and he had his hands clasped in front of his upper knee. I smiled and waved to him as I floated closer to him. He didn't move. He was tottaly still and watched me very intently. AS my boat passed in front of him (about 15 yards), I realised that this man wasn't wearing any clothes at all and he was covered completely with a very thick silver fur! Even his eyes were almost completely hidden from a thick (eyebrow?)of silver fur. WE stared at each other the entire time I passed by him, myself with my jaw gaping (I'm sure), and he just quietly sitting very still. AS soon as I looked ahead to see where everyone else was at and then looked back toward the rope swing, he was gone and just the branches of the bush that was near it was moving. I have never seen anything like it before in my life. I thought I was honestly seeing things until my niece pulled me aside later that evening and asked me if I had seen the Sasquatch that was sitting by the rope swing. I honestly have never really given much thought to Bigfoot before that day.  I had passed close enough to him to actually see the direction the fur was growing in! It was mostly all one direction (down)like a dog's hair, except around his eyes were it seemed to stick straight out.","I am not sure as to how to get to the actual campground spot except by boat!

" My buddy Terry and I decided to head up for a weekend at Sullivan Lake, to do some fishing, and to just get away from it all.  We got to our spot on the lake, a little spot away from the campgrounds on the south end of the lake. It was a few hours before the sun went down. We had plenty of time to set up a tent and to cook a nice dinner.  After we had put out the fire, we both got in our sleeping bags and dozed off.  I dont know how long we were out, but some time later in the night, Terry and I were both woken up by some large crash that sounded maybe 100 or so yards away. When we opened up the tent and got out to investigate, we both looked at eachother and asked eachother, do you smell that?  Something in the air smelled musty, almost rotten.  We both had our flashlights handy, but because of the trees that surrounded us, it was hard to see anything very far away.  We both called out to see if any person was in the area, which there shouldnt have been, with how far away from the campground we were. After about 5 minutes of just scanning we figured it was nothing of importance and decided to just forget it.  Almost the instant we got inside the tent we heard an even louder crash that sounded like it was only 10 to 15 yards away from our site.  Terry and I both frantically searched for anything we could find to protect ourselves from whatever was outside. The best we could do was to pull out our pocket knives. I heard something like a grunt coming from the side opposite of the door of the tent, so I shined my flashlight out of the mesh window and I saw something.  Just past the clearing of our site, I could make out a tall shape and some gray fur, on something that stood maybe 7 to 9 feet tall. Maybe the flashlight scared it, or maybe it just wanted to investigate, but as soon as i turned my flashlight on it, it ran fast through the woods. Before i could walk out the door to shine my light on it and see it better, it was already gone.  Terry stood outside of the tent, and was shaking when i first saw him in the light. We both decided to spend the rest of the night in my truck, and lock the doors.

" In July 2005, my son and I were prospecting in Pend Oreille Co,Wa.  just outside Metaline Falls City.  We had been asleep for a couple of hours when I was awoke by the smell of wet fur. I got up to go relieve myself while looking at the creek when I spotted something walking across the creek about twenty feet away from my truck. I quickly went back to my truck and tried to wake my son to no avail. While doing this I grabbed my rifle and stepped away from the truck where I chambered a round and watched until the figure stopped by a tree next to the bank, then told my son to hit the remote button to unlock the truck and turn on the bed light to shine out towards the creek.  This I did several times until I felt safe again. I could not see the figure anymore so I went to bed.

"Well, my dad had taken me, my sisters, brother, and step mother out for a day of 'rock hunting' so that he could find the rare and odd rocks that he loves to go and find in the mountain areas. Me and my younger sister were walking along a trail that my step mother and youngest sister had just come from, they had said it was a nice trail and that we should check it out. So we did. About...a fourth of a mile towards a half of a mile down the trail me and my sister stop at this little creek, we stay there for a while playing in the water, I wanted to continue down the trail, but my sister freaked out on me, telling me that she had a very bad feeling and wanted to go back to where my dad and the others were. I told her it was ok and eventually convinced her to head down the trail a bit more, however once we started off again something charged at us from a wooded hill that was right next to me. We heard this horrible terrifying howl/growl coming towards us as the trees and bushes moved around as if a truck was coming through them. All i saw was a black figure and I started running, I yelled to my sister to get the hell out of there, me and her both cursing and running as fast as we could over the trail, now that I recall the trail was a dirt bike trail, i still don't know the exact location, it was a while ago. Anyways as we ran back I fell and hit my ribs, i couldn't run any longer and looked back to make sure whatever the hell it was, wasn't chasing us, and nothing was there, my sister wouldn't stop so i had to keep going, even though I was so out of breath I couldn't run anymore. She wouldn't stop. When we got back we were both crying and so scared that we left right away with everyone because we couldn't stay there any longer. We were to scared. I thought at the time it was a bear, or a cougar, then on the way home i realized those don't sound like that, i know what those sound like, and whatever was chasing us did not sound like a bear or cougar. After hearing some prerecorded, suposed, whoops and howling from bigfoot in my area, it got me scared becuase they sounded so similar to what me and my sister heard","Rock quarry type area, thick woods, on a dirt road, im sorry i cant be more specific than that.

"It was about 7:30 on Friday the 15th of November. It had been dark for a couple hours and had been raining all day. I was wood working on my front porch. Several houses exist in the woods around me, but the properties are large and wooded, and civilization only diminishes as you head South. Our neighbors live about 20 yards East of us, and ten yards beyond their house are old growth cedars, maples, and firs. They weren't home at the time. I was in the middle of using my cordless drill, when I heard this call come from the woods. I instantly stopped drilling and listened. The first thing I thought was ""That's loud!"". It started in a low moan-like sound and climbed to almost a scream. The sound lasted steadily for three seconds, then was followed by two to three short whooping sounds. At that point I was severely freaked and was already heading inside. I only report it because it seems consistent with other reports I've read.

"Im a gunsmith in Seattle WA. I was out deer hunting on 11/16/02 east of GREENWATER WA. off of FSRD.73 approx. 12 mi. in off of RT.410 high up on a mountain 200 yds from Mt. Rainier N.P. Approx. 8:30am I was slowly working my way down the frozen dirt rd watching for any movement when about 300 yds down the road my eye caught a movement. It was black & coming toward me. At first glance I thought it was a bear but as I watched it I could see it was walking upright so I assumed it was a man.& I thought ""What the hell is this idiot doing up here in the middle of nowhere during deer hunting season dressed like that without a stitch of blaze orange on..God, he's even wearing a black stocking cap He's just begging to get shot.

When it lept or bounded, I could see no distinction between the two legs. So I quickened my pace as I thought ""What the hell was that!!"" I got to a small grass road where there was a place where another campsite was About 60 yds from where this thing hit the trees,I made a mental mark where it went in, The grass road went in about 40 yds and then I was looking straight down off the ridge. I sat down on a pile of big deadfall and waited, figuring it would either come toward me or away from me..as it sure as hell wouldnt go over that ridge. After 20 mins. or so, I walked back out to the dirt road and went down to where I thought it had gone into the trees..as the mud in the dirt rd was frozen, I couldnt find any tracks..hell, I wasnt even leaving any tracks..I searched up & down the tree line it was so thick w/ under brush I couldnt find any tracks there either..But I knew that if it was a bear or any big animal w/ claws, it would have left at least claw marks when it leaped!",East on Rt. 410 out of Enumclaw WA.

"April? 2003 Washington state. A friend and I drove from Seattle towards Mount Rainier. Heading south on the 164/410 we pulled off onto one of many dirt roads just a few miles south of Enumclaw. I drove a few miles and parked. We hiked in the forest for a few hours and when we tried to get back to the freeway someone had locked some yellow gates on all the access roads. We had to spend the night in the car and right after dark we began hearing what sounded like hard wood beating on soft wood(like someone hitting a tree with a baseball bat) very close, maybe within 100 ft. We were terrified and drove around the access roads for a few miles and within minutes of shutting the car off it started again very close. This was not just a loud noise echoing all throughout the woods, even from inside the car I could definately tell this was within throwing distance and directed at us. We left and drove several miles again and again minutes after the car stopped the noise started again. We drove until we found a road that was seperated by just a ten foot ravine from the freeway and still it started, this time more distant in the forest.

It was getting late around 11:00 PM so I decided to pitch my tent just for the night off a Forest Service Rd. heading south from State Highway 410. I was wide awake reading a magazine inside my tent when I heard a distinct animal vocalization essentially identical to the recordings on the BFRO website listed as the Puyallup and Snohomish recordings. The call consisted of a 20 to 30 second duration ""shriek/howl"" and multiple ""bark/grunts"" of short duration lasting about 90 seconds. My Golden Retriever was sound asleep for most of the vocalization but woke up for the last 15 seconds and immediately bacame alert peering out into the darkness.

So we hike up the hill side to where the noise is coming from and where the pond is, and we discovered a foot print while the whole time still hearing this noise, ooh ooh ooh, short and sharp but monkey like.

"On this particular morning I am confident to report that I had a sighting of Sasquatch. I am a forest worker and build and mantain trails for a living. In the past decade I have had plenty of encounters of the 4 legged species, including cougar and black bear. What I saw this morning was not a black bear (though in my mind I kept hoping it was). I was within 20 ft. of the creature who leaned down under a fir limb to get a better view of me. I had been leveling an area of shale rock trail with my McCloud tool, when I realized that something was slamming rocks together on my right. My usual response is to raise my voice and yell (No bear Go Bear) and with that I usually see a quick flash of black fur and a crashing of brush. Not this time! So I picked up a lage rock yelled with more force and tossed the rock. By this time I had started slowly stepping backwards towards the Suburban, I did not take my eyes of the spot. I thought I saw something move and bent down slightly to get a look at what was moving the fir limb on the tree. I then noticed a movement of dark brown( a leg) and then a face. My adrenalin coursed, I threw my tools in the back of the rig and drove to the other side of the forest where the rest of the crew was working. They are the only ones I trust with this. Being a woman working in the woods, I get teased enough and I do not want to be the laughing stock among the rest of the employees. They returned to the sight with me and even though they did'nt see anything they felt too spooked to stay. So all 3 of us left the area.",The site is on the flanks of Mount Rainier.

"My friend R-- and his wife and myself and my wife went out toward Mt. Rainier to do some trap shooting. We turned onto a very bumpy, pot-holed gravel road a few miles from the town of Ashford. After getting through a number of trees that had blown down in the wind storms of winter, 2006, we reached a dead-end at a bridge over the Nisqually River that had washed out in the record rains and flooding of November, 2006. We were about a mile...maybe more..from the nearest blacktop road and any human habitation. We had decided to make a day of shooting so we brought an automatic trap machine, several boxes of biodegradable clay pidgions, LOTS of shotgun shells in trap loads, chairs, a folding table, plenty of food and drinks (coffee, water, fruit juices, tea) however...no alcohol because my friend and his wife are diabetic and I take meds that don't mix well with alcohol. Therefore, we just don't drink. Besides, booze and guns NEVER go well together under ANY circumstances. After several hours of shooting clays, we decided to have a bite to eat and sat down at the table we had set up right behind my open truck canopy. We were eating and talking and listening to some great oldies on an MP3 radio when I noticed my friend R-- looking intently into the forest behind me. I asked him what he was looking at and he said he wasn't sure. He said that he saw what looked like a very large stump about 25-30 yards back in the woods when it appeared to move slightly. When it did so, R-- said that for a few moments he could see daylight under the stump----as if he were looking between someones' legs, which then disappeared after it moved. Of course we all looked and sure enough, through a long, narrow opening in the trees we could see what looked to be a very large, dark stump with a somewhat rounded pointy top. The ""stump"" looked to be about 7-8 feet tall and at least 3 feet wide. It was hard to gage height because the undergrowth was so thick and dense that it was hard to know how much of the ""stump"" was hidden from our view from the ground up. Something that we began to notice as we looked around was that we saw a few other stumps but none of them were as large or as tall as the ""stump"" we were looking at, nor were there any trees that were even close to the diameter of our stump anywhere. Also, the other stumps were obviously cut down with a chain saw leaving a fairly flat--maybe slightly angled or beveled top on them. Our stump angled up from both sides to a slightly rounded point in the middle. It did not move. We all watched the stump and talked and joked about what it could be. After a half hour or so, the stump was still there, not moving, so we decided to go back to shooting trap. I think by this time we had all come to regard the ""stump"" as just that, a stump in the woods. The movement my friend saw was attributed to the fact that the wind was blowing and the moving tree branches created moving patterns of shadow and light in the forest. After about another hour of shooting we decided to start cleaning up and getting ready to leave. I sat on my chair to put my shotgun in its' case and without really thinking, I glanced back into the forest to look at the stump. It was gone! I thought maybe I had moved the chair and was looking in the wrong place. So, I moved the chair around and found that there was only one narrow opening through the trees where the ""stump"" could have been and there was no getting around the fact that it was not there. I called R-- over and told him that the stump was gone. He too looked and looked and could not locate our stump. Our wives by now were there and they too agreed that the ""stump"" was gone and that they were more than ready to leave, A.S.A.P. We began to go over any possible explanation for what we had seen. Deer? Nope. Too small and even if a deer had been standing perfectly facing us, we should have seen the narrowing of the chest into the neck and the small head and large ears. Elk? Nope. Same arguement as with a deer. Bear? Well, if it was a bear, it would have had to have been standing on its' hind legs facing directly at us and not moving a muscle for at least a half an hour...probably more. Besides, we should have seen the outline of the bears' body narrowing to a neck and then going to the nearly round profile of a bears' head, and again, we saw no ears. Also, it would have had to have been an absolutely HUGE bear to equal the height and bulk of the ""stump"". Also, we could not imagine any of the afore-mentioned animals staying around as close as this for so long a time considering we had shot around 300 rounds of 12 and 20 gauge shotgun shells in the time we were there. As we began to drive back out to the highway we officially went on ""sasquatch watch"". It was the only thing that fit what we had seen. This area is totally wild and all any creature would have to do is cross the Nisqually River for nearly complete solitude because of the washed-out bridge. What really began to shake us up was the fact that whatever this was that we saw was not afraid of us or the noise and concussion of our shotguns. It appeared to be observing us at the time we first noticed it and it remained stock-still for 30-45 minutes while we observed it at a distance of 25-30 yards. How long it was in the area watching us before we noticed it or how long it stayed around after we lost sight of it is un-nerving to say the least. Was it watching us out of curiosity or was it being territorial and wanted to see who was on its' turf? It sure makes us wonder. While sasquatch has long been a topic of lite conversation on our various shooting and fishing trips, this incident certainly has us believing that maybe there IS something out there in our forests that we don't know about. We can't prove its' existance beyond our sighting and the multitude of others who have seen something they can't explain. I know from now on, every trip into the forest will hold a whole new sense of wonder and exitement and will have a renewed expectation and hope that we might see something again to further explain what we saw today!","The paved road was HWY 706 between Elbe and Ashford.

"My husband and I were up off of highway 410, about 5 miles outside of Greenwater (on the FS road right after the fire station on the left side of the road)around the first part of June in 2008.  We had come from Tacoma and I was trying to get my husband acquainted with being in the woods at night, so we headed up to a place I liked to go occasionally to start a fire and cook some food and relax.  It was a site for what looked like an old rock quarry alongside the right hand side of the woods. I chose the spot because it was fairly open to the road and there were also a large number of campers dotted throughout the woods and along the river at the time.  It should also be noted that it was foggy. We pulled into the muddy rock pit(we were driving a '69 220 Mercedes) drove in about 50 feet and then noticed something in front of the car.  My husband seemed panicked and wondered what the hell it was.  It was gray(light colored)big, human shape, visible right in front of our car no more than 15 feet from the front bumper.  Even though I knew it wasn't human or a known animal, I told him it was a deer's butt and not to be scared. He has stopped the car at this point and then we both witnessed the creature climb up the side of the quarry at a high rate of speed.  He was terrified, but for some reason, I wasn't scared at all even though I had just something unexplainable.  I convinced him to park and we got the stuff out the trunk headed up the other side of the quarry and started the fire.  By the time it was really going it was dark out and we were just sitting and talking.  It also started to rain a little.  I had the unerving feeling that we were being watched.  That was when we saw headlights coming up the road and turning into the quarry.  It was the sheriff.  He stopped at our car then came up the side of the quarry in his truck, shining his search beam on us as he ascended.  After asking what we were doing he left and headed down the side of the quarry in which we had seen the creature earlier.  I noticed about a quarter of the way down he stopped and shone his light into the woods at which time the previously viewed creature was spotted standing at the edge of the woods.  It turned around and headed back into the woods and the sheriff sped down the side of the quarry.  I bet he remembers it, but I don't remember his name. We left immediatelly. It should also be noted that I didn't feel scared at all and I almost forgot that I had seen the creature until we drove home and my husband reminded me.

"I have been researching bf for the last few months.  I read a report that I thought lead me to the area but Im having trouble finding it. My girlfriend and I decided on the spur of the moment to go check it out.  I drove my 4x4(4x4 needed to get there) up into the woods, we set up camp at about 11am aug 23 2008.  I didnt do anything out of the ordinary for a camping trip except through out 2 or 3 whoops during the day just kinda trying to practice making a sound that sounded some what believable.  We gathered some wood, made a fire, BBQ some burgers, it was a pretty uneventful day.  We decided to hit the hey relatively early at about ten to ten thirty.  We werent sleeping very soundly we were both waking throughout the night.  At about 3am I woke up and noticed the fire was about to go out, I hoped out of the truck turned some logs on the fire, took a leak and crawled back in bed.  No sooner then I got comfortable a very loud whoopish sound that turned into a bird sound at the end, it was all one breath no pause, much to loud to be a bird, and it was within 25 yards of my camp.  Within 30 seconds another one answered back from what I would guess to be a mile away atleast.  I grabed the flashlight and the rifle(just in case)I shined the light in the tree line. As soon as I turned the light on it got spooked, it got out of there but it wasnt a full run more of a jog. It was so close could hear the thuds of its feet on the ground.  I was tired and fell back to sleep within a hour or so my girlfriend couldnt sleep and said she heard another vocalization more distant then the first two.

"Was camped in my car watching a DVD when I heard what may have been a very loud tree knock to the west.  It seemed to come from the edge of the partial clearing I was in, perhaps 75 to 100 yards.  My first thought was a heavy bough snapped and fell, but the loud noise was not followed by any crashing sound. Perhaps an hour later a brief scream/yell was heard just to my north.  It came from a height, and my first thought was an owl in large tree about 25 yards away, but it didn't sound avian at all.  It sounded strangely feminine for some reason.  Reading the BFRO forum I saw owls, cougars, and foxes can emit calls that may be sasquatch-ish, but listening to audio clips of these critters I've found on the internet won't allow me to categorize the sound as any of these known species.

"I am 21 years old, live in Eatonville, Wa, under Mt. Rainier, have been researching the Sasquatch phenomenon since I was 7 or 8 years old, and this is the first encounter of any kind I've ever had. I was laying down to sleep on Sept. 29(my room and window faces the woods) when I heard the first of a series of vocalizations. First, I heard a distant call. It sounded kinda deep and man-like. Then, about 20 minutes later, the neighbors dogs on the other side of the 5 acres of woods between us started losing their minds and barking their heads off, and almost immediatly, I heard 4 or 5 siren-like calls(think of the vocalization that you hear on the 1994 A&E Bigfoot documentary). Very loud, very clear. From the 3rd call on, they faded as whatever made them seemed to be heading back deeper into the woods. Then, about 10 to 15 minutes later, the dogs went off again and I heard this chatter-like vocals, almost threatening sounding. It seemed to have a variation of sounds within the chatter. Like a mix between human-like barks/grunts, and an indescribable chattering that I just cannot explain. It did this for a few minutes, off and on. Seemed like it was taunting the dogs. And finally, it made a few fading groans as it seemed to head back to the deeper woods for the last time. And that was the last I heard of it.","I've heard many of the animals that inhabit this area, but I've never heard this before.",Pierce County,Washington,Fall,Report 24835: Man hears possible vocalizations close to his home near Eatonville,46.878,-122.3574,9/29/2008,24835,Class B,c22fxtyh1u,77.69,62.835,47.98,46.95,0.72,0.02,0.02,0,0,,1016.09,Clear throughout the day.,4,10,3,0.41
"My friend and I were hunting East of Elbe, WA in Nov 2008. We had just pulled up at our spot and were unoading our gear when we immediatly started hearing a strange sound coming from the treeline behind us. It was a whooping, tongue clicking type of sound and it was really creepy. Reminded me of the ape cage at the zoo except for the weird sound at the end. We started making similar sounds back at it and it started answering us. Then, we heard it walking north in the treeline while continuing to make the sound.  We grabbed our guns and jumped back into the truck. It made it's way around to the other side of where we were but never stepped out into the open. After a few minutes, we heard and felt a thud on the road about 20 feet from our truck. We locked and loaded our guns and went to check it out. There was a small boulder in the middle of the road that was not there a few minutes before. I could tell it had been thrown there due to the fresh indents in the ground and marks on it. We scanned the area and the sounds started again, this time from the treeline on our right. The fog was lifting and we walked towards the area the sounds were coming from. All of a sudden, we heard something very big moving through the forest away from us. It was breaking tree branches and we could hear it walking through the underbrush. We headed back to the truck and got in to talk about what had just happened. We were both freaked out and our adrenaline was really pumping. We stayed in the truck for a while until the sun came up shortly afterward and started burning off the fog. We briefly looked around the area but didn't find any sign. We both knew it had to be a sasquatch and decided to leave the area and hunt somewhere else. After reading reports on this website, the sounds we heard were similiar to sounds heard by other witnesses so I'm 99.9% positive it was a sasquatch.",Please keep location private.

"Myself and my 7 year old grand daughter were out checking out some of the reported sigthings in the pierce county area.These sightings were a couple years old. The report #20591 is the site where we encountered vocals if thats what you want to call it, I call it a bunch of screaming. Anyway, we turned right at the first baptist church and went down this gravel pot holed road, we went as far as we could which was 1/2 mile maybe. the road is blocked off by giant rocks so we parked there got out walked straight down the road followed it for an hour or so anyway we seen a not trespassing sign posted up in a tree we were trying to make it to the river guess u cant get there anymore. we did see a green van parked down the road also, so we headed back to the truck. after getting back to the truck I was thinking about leaving the area but noticed another road across this small creek that ran along side of the road rite where the truck was parked. we crossed it went threw the area where the big pipes are and turn right followed the road which turns in to a path i'd call it anyway we got about 100 feet, i heard what i thought was a gruggling sound i stopped and i also noticed i did hear birds everything went dead quiet then I heard a faint little whine. Then the screaming started behind us. from where we came from on top of the hill to the left of where we came down the path about 50 yards back in dense brush area. something was screaming then I heard another something start screaming i thought OMG!! their are two holy crap!! we tried to quietly make our way back to the top of the hill, at the same time i could hear them moving towards us through the brush and they were still screaming I had positioned myself above the area i thought I could get a good picture of them if they came out of the brush into this small clearing it was perfect wind was towards us so i know they didnt get wind of us. we hiding behind a tree. My grand daughter was really getting scared at this point and made noise and they went quiet stopped and i heard them move away from us threw the brush on to the road to our left and they disappeared, gone that quick i searched the area where i thought they were for prints nothing but smashed down grass and some broken branches. I am experienced hunter from way back and heard all the animals in the forest except these guys!! Their screams scared me too along with my grand daughter.

"Went out near Nisqually River with dog to build camp fire and enjoy nice night weather alone. In a remote spot on the river on Joint Base Lewis McCord I was with my dog Oscar. The fire had just started to catch up and my dog started barking toward the river ferociously. This is very out of character for him. I told him to be quiet and come back to me. I then heard large rocks being thrown into the river. I went to inspect with my flashlight and saw nothing. They were large rocks because I could hear them hitting the rocks on the bottom of the river. There were more than 5 rocks thrown. The experience was so creepy that I immediately put my dog in my Jeep and left. I am an avid outdoorsman and notice details always, on the way in I observed that no one had been in the area since the last rain because there were no tracks. In this area there is no access to the other side of the river other than walking in. I observed no evidence of other humans such as lights, fire, or sounds.

"Personal information edited out by the investigator to protect the privacy of the witness.  Names have been changed to initials.  Timeframe:  The following series of incidents occurred starting in April of 2012.  Possibly as early as April / May of 2011. Private, full-time residence and immediate surrounding area.   Rural.  Heavily wooded rugged terrain, south-west of Mount Rainier National Park.   There is nothing behind (north) of this location for many miles. There are numerous logging roads thru this area both maintained and old.  Many drainages, streams and game trails  There are no homes or residents throughout the area north of us.  It is mountainous and wild. Wildlife:  Large deer and elk population, bear, cougar, owl, fox… all seen on the property.  If it is native to this immediate area, it’s likely here. Incident Descriptions: April 27, 2012 -  Witnesses: PC and neighbor FP. Around noon on the 27th both witnesses heard exceptionally loud and continuous screams for approximately twenty minutes moving from east to west in the tree-line to the south of their homes as though something was “being chased” and “in fear of its life”.  Both witness’s are in their eighties.  PC grew up in the area and returned here to live 2.5 years ago.  FP has lived in the area for over twenty-seven years.  Both are familiar with the sounds of wildlife in the area and both state that they “have never heard anything like this before”.  The screaming was described as human like, but not human.  Moving rapidly as though being chased.  The sound “went through them” and “scared the life out of” them.  When asked why they didn’t call 911 they both said that they should have, but did not know what or how to report what they were hearing and thought they would be “laughed at”.   I (LC, PC's son) was out of town during this incident, but it was reported to me by my mother during a phone call that same day.  During that call I told her that both FP and her had likely heard some elk running through the woods. May 18/19, 2012 – Witness LC (reporting source).  I had just returned home from playing hockey in Seattle and was unloading the car behind my house at 3am.  I felt I was being watched.  It was pitch black out and the Baard Owls were going crazy all around the house.  Then the owls stopped like a switch had been  thrown.  After a brief pause something yelled at me from about 100 to 150 yards away (?) in the woods… somewhere between me and the stream behind us anyway.  I have never heard anything like this in my life.  It was human like, but not human.  The sound went right through me.  It felt like a less than lethal crowd control weapon (I spent 25 years in the military / civil service with multiple overseas tours and had been exposed to these).  The hair on my body stood straight up, I felt chilled and distinctly “warned off”.  I left my hockey sticks in the car (anyone who knows me knows that I do not leave my sticks anywhere!) and went strait inside the house.  I told J (my fiancé) that “I was done… something just yelled at me out there” and called it a night.  The next afternoon my mother, PC, asked if I heard that thing outside last night.  I told her yes and she said that was exactly what she and FP had heard for twenty minutes a few weeks before.  It was not any animal that I have heard before and I’ve heard weird owl calls, strange cougar sounds, fox etc.  This was at a volume and resonance that was off the chart.  I could literally feel the sound pass thru me.  For the next few weeks while out back, I was feeling watched…  not all the time, but frequently. May 28/29, 2012 approx. 11pm to 2am – While laying in bed I could hear a faint sound like what was heard earlier in the month.  It sounded as if it was on or near a ridgeline to the north of the house.  Around 2am J said she heard it too and it was “really weird”. Aug 12, 2012 – I was mowing the lawn in the back (north) of the house when I hit a rock with the lawnmower.  I still have the bruises from where the rock hit my leg as I write this.  Aside from being injured, I was annoyed that there was a rock in that portion of the yard as I had been continuously clearing the area of rocks for quite a few weeks and had that specific area clean.  As I looked around the area I found that there wasn’t just one rock, but nearly a hundred rocks all about fist sized laying around the area, about five to fifteen feet from the wood-line.  There are no kids in the area and I do not know of any animals that distribute rocks on the ground as if thrown. Aug 19, 2012 – While visiting with GJ and TJ, a part-time neighbor who has a cabin approx. ¼ mile to the east of us I asked “have you heard the screaming man?”  When I asked this GJ turned almost white.  He said that both he and his wife TJ had in-fact heard what I was describing “a few months ago like May, maybe”.  They said they had not reported it because they had “no idea of what it was”, but that it had scared them too. Note:  I have been hesitant to write this report, but was convinced to do so by this final report from GJ and TJ.  I started this report by indicating a possible 2011 event.  This occurred from Late April to mid-June of 2011, so the same approx. timeframe of these recent incidents, though separated by one year.  All I can say is that both J and I heard “talking” between what sounded to be a male and female human back in the woods on multiple nights (after midnight usually).  This was strange as there is nothing back there.  But we both remember hearing only “mumbling”, no clear speech.  But that mumbling had to have carried for at least a hundred yards –plus for us to have heard it.  I wrote it off at the time as potentially game control officers looking for poachers.  But looking back now I also considered it very strange. If nothing else, I hope this report adds a few more data points to your efforts.  There have been multiple events in this area over the years, but people are very reluctant to discuss them.  You can feel free to contact me and I have the permission of all reporting sources to include their names in this report.  They have also indicated a willingness to share their stories with any follow-on investigation of this report.",5 miles outside the main entrance to Mount Rainier National Park.,Pierce County,Washington,Spring,"Report 36310: Family has frequent visits by someone they call the ""Screaming Man"" near Ashford",46.75953,-122.0246,5/18/2012,36310,Class B,c234p226h8,57.25,45.165,33.08,36,0.68,0.39,0.93,0,0,,,Mostly cloudy until afternoon.,8,10,248,0.63
"In June of 2012 my son woke me up at approximately 3 am telling me that he heard whispering somewhere around the house. I told him to go back to bed because he was dreaming. within minutes I heard the whispering as well. I grabbed a flashlight and left my bedroom which is on the second floor of my house. My son immediately asked me if I heard the whispering as well. The ""whispering"" sounded like someone was whispering loudly and it sounded like a foreign language or gibberish of some sort. I first thought that is was outside in my back yard but wanted to clear my house first to be sure someone wasn't in my home. shortly after looking around my house I the whispering stopped. five or six days later  on July 4th I was in my back yard getting ready to cut the grass when I noticed the area of my yard where the grass was higher was trampled down and there was a feces pile in the grass. I have seen scat from most all of the animals in my area and this didn't appear to come from any of them. It was very large, black and looked like it came from a human. my first thought was that someone took a crap in my yard. I then called my son to come take a look and he reminded me of the whispering that had taken place days earlier. I was watching finding bigfoot one evening and I heard Bobo talking about squatch's speaking gibberish and it immediately made me think of that incident. April of 2015 my dog woke me up wanting to go out side to go potty at around 2-3 am. while outside i heard what sounded like a baseball bat or something striking a tree two times in the wooded area to the east across the road from my house. this past May my daughter and her boyfriend also experienced something strange while walking a trail  to my house. I wont post it here as it is her story and I don't want to speak for her on record but am happy to provide the story verbally.",,Pierce County,Washington,Summer,Report 50160: Gibberish-like talking heard at a residence near DuPont,47.09982,-122.6246,6/1/2012,50160,Class B,c22gcw72rd,66.54,60.02,53.5,57.76,0.88,0.87,0.4,0.0073,0.9,rain,1014.14,Light rain in the morning.,4,9.64,238,1.8
"OK, last night I went home from Walmart in Spanaway Washington, and I turned left onto 8th Ave E, which goes from Spanaway highway 7 which is Pacific Avenue also. This street turns into a two lane country road that makes one of the borders of Joint base Lewis-McChord. It is a long dark two lane country road that bisects a huge prairie with lots of old growth woodlands bordering it. I drove home the back way again tonight hoping to pinpoint the exact location for you, but there are no mile markers nearby where I seen what I saw. The best I can do, is it is Approximately 4-5 miles out from town, the road is largely flat and straight, but there are a few rises as you drive. The place I was at was about 3-400 ft from the second place where there is a rise in the road. I know this because I could see the creature with a hill in the background and some trees, and when we drove up through there tonight there was no place else that fit those two things. First off, it was very dark, and oddly devoid of cars, as there is usually someone flashing their lights at me as my car has a headlight out and I have been driving with my brights on until payday to get it fixed. I think if I had not had my brights on, I would never have seen this creature. At any rate, suddenly I seen the Patterson Film in real life, about 400 ft down the road ahead of me. The creature I saw fit the same color scheme of Harry and the Hendersons, but in behavior it was nearly identical to the Patterson film. It strided across the road in 3-4 strides, and in as many was way off to the right again when it stopped mid-stride and looked back at me exactly like the patterson film, but this thing looked huge, even from the distance I saw it. When you see something that does not fit into the ordinary part of what you perceive as your reality, your brain tries to pidgeon-hole the data into one file after another, click click click click and suddenly you come up with ""Does not compute"" At first I thought was a smudge on my windshield, but it was moving right along. Just like the patterson film. So I went to work, and several people live near me and I decided to tell somebody. One guy had a girlfriend who seen him within a mile of my house within a month ago, and then a week ago his father came home at midnight telling him he had seen one in the same area in the headlight of his Harley where a small creek runs under the road and the creature appeared to be crossing the road where the small bridge was. It's weird how this effects you. I could really see how someone could keep this to themselves for their entire lives. However, when I shared this story, I got ""Oh yeah, this happened and that happened,"" To ""My Cousin, My Brother, My Dad, and even a couple of personal stories from people who grew up here. I was always willing to give it an open mind, but the lack of physical evidence sort of left me wondering, if I had to be honest. Now I know we share our woods with one big sumbitch, and you better be paying attention when you are cookin up that bacon at 8 pm in the woods around here cuz I don't think he got that big eatin dandelion greens. :) My impression, one HUGE Chewbacca/Harry and the Hendersons kinda guy, at least 2.5-3 ft thick thru the chest from back to front and if I had to estimate would be tall even for a Sasquatch at 9-12 ft like I said it was a quite a ways up the road, but I had time to see it, evaluate, and question it and look again, and then again after that as it looked to the right at me coming down the road, so it was a pretty firm sighting even if I am still questioning myself the next day. Like I said your brain tries to rationalize anything that ""Does not Compute"" but I was not under the influence of anything. Still puzzling and marvelling over it all. My urge to get in a last minute camping trip just evaporated like a puff of smoke lol! that's my experience and I sure never expected to be posting this :) ",listed above,Pierce County,Washington,Fall,Report 36467: Man driving home through Joint Base Lewis-McChord sees an animal walk across the road south of Spanaway,47.05072,-122.4212,9/12/2012,36467,Class A,c22gwjrd73,71.25,57.375,43.5,43.75,0.66,0,0.88,0,0,,1025.99,Clear throughout the day.,6,10,7,1.43
"I had hiked up to Echo Lake along the Greenwater Echo Lake trail near Greenwater Washington. I and my friend had setup camp for the night along the northern edge of the lake. I woke up around 2 am to hearing very large stomping going through my camp. It sounded like ""stomp stomp stomp stomp"" and I could hear branches being broken as it was walking. I have never heard anything walk so loudly and it seemed to be moving quickly It sounded like it was heavy and was on 2 legs.. What terrified me is that i had reacted to the sound of the stomping by moving to grab my knife. The stomping then stopped and it went quiet. I felt like I was being watched. I didnt have my rainfly on over the tent. I was to afraid to look out and was trying to stay as still as I could in my sleeping bag.

"Last year in October around 6 pm. I was sitting at a stop sign at a T in the road. I looked to my left and saw something come out of the woods. As I watched this thing, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up and I felt immediate terror. I was too shocked and scared to even pick up my cell phone and take a picture of it. I watched it walk across the road to the other side of the woods. It was not a bear as it walked on 2 legs. It was not a human as I looked for shoes, hands, facial features. It was black and hairy with long arms. It has taken me so long to say anything to anyone as I never knew where to report it to. Plus I didn't want people to think I was crazy. It never looked at me  But just stared straight ahead. I told my husband about it and he didn't know what to think.

"My family and I live near Orting, Washington in The Buttes housing development.  My house is situated at the highest elevation in the development, right around 700 feet and near the water tower.  My back yard is bordered by woods that extend for 200-300 yards without interruption.  My bedroom window looks out over the back yard from a height of about 12 feet towards the woods and we always sleep with the window open. The first incident occurred right around the last week in August of this year (2012). At 2:45 a.m. my wife and I were awakened by a series of piercing shrieks.  They were very loud and sounded as though they were coming from the woods right in back of our house.  They did not sound like any other animal that I have ever heard. This continued for perhaps 5 minutes and then abruptly ceased as it began to rain.  The second incident happened approximately 5 weeks later early on a Tuesday morning in October of 2012.  This time, at just after 3 a.m. we were awakened by two shrieking screams followed by several minutes of intermittent whooping sounds, something like whoop..whoop...whoop...WHOOooop..This stopped almost immediately after we heard the same whoops from a distance of what I would estimate to be at least half a mile away.  The last incidence was in mid October at 3:15 a.m. when I was awakened to the same whooping sounds from a distance (1/4 mile?).  There were two sets of vocalizations just a few seconds apart, from two different sources.  There were some dogs barking like crazy at that time from the same general direction.

"I went camping up Little Deer Creek on Forrest Rd 1820 in Finny Creek area Skagit Valley in 2006. The road ends at the bridge that crosses the creek. I hiked roughly two miles up the creek and camped on a gravel bar. The creek on the North side of me by 20 feet and the large forest of fir and cedar to my south by 75 feet. There was a small stand of alder between me and the forest where I had collected my firewood and materials for my lean-to and bench. Before sun down I caught about seven cutthroat trout out of the pool next to my camp and pan fried them. Shortly after sunset I began to hear what I would describe as an axe handle being struck against a tree in the forest to my south. It would rap out three distinct strikes and then move through the forest and repeat striking at different trees. This went on about an hour and well into pitch black. The forest in that area is as rough as any in the Pacific Northwest and would be terribly dangerous for a man to attempt to navigate in the darkness. About 30 minutes after the end of the tree strikes, I had settled down and was just relaxing when a pine cone came bouncing through my campsite coming from the forest and stopping just short of the creek. The nearest Fir tree was 75 feet from me. At this point I cracked my Scotch and proceeded to calm my nerves. The Next morning I gathered my gear and exited the area.","Coming from Interstate 5, take HWY 20 East to Concrete, turn right on Concrete-Sauk Valley rd, follow that to Finney Creek Rd.

"I fished till dark then headed to my truck. Threw my float tube in the back and cruised over to a nearby swamp to change out of my fishing waders and eat a snack. I sat for awhile listening to the frogs, they were so loud you couldn't hear yourself think. I was enjoying a Washington summer night. Out in the dark swamp 6 feet below me about 35 yards away I saw a pair animal eyes moving towards me. I thought I would let this deer just pass and even got excited for a second. As it came near I saw that it would eventually pass my location so I sat and watched. At around twenty yards or less I noticed from the blue/clear eyes that the deer was walking strangely. I got a little nervous and whistled to let it know of my presence and that is when I realized this set of eyes are connected to an animal walking on two legs! After the whistle the animal looked at me and walked off slowly looking over its shoulder. It tripped while looking over its shoulder, I could see the eyes go down then slowly get up again all the while watching me and walked off into the swamp looking over its shoulder. I was honestly freaked. I got out of there and didn't go back for quite some time.

"up hunting on road 1855 above Darrington, WA. Friday Oct.22 2010. mid day, 4200 ft.elv. We were at the end of the road on top of a ridge, my buddy was checking out a steep canyon on one side of the ridge and I hiked down about 40 yrds. down the other side (east). I was just looking around for deer or bear, this area is well known for black bear, one had been shot a week before in this area. I heard some branches breaking down from me about 100 yrds. so I started watching in the direction of the noise. I saw a few tree branches moving, not like from wind and all of a sudden I saw what looked like a brownish/black shoulder and head of something, I don't know for sure what it was but I know that I've been in the woods a lot in my 51 years and nothing ever before made the hair on my neck stand up in the woods like it did that day. Also there was a faint odor of rotten meat or rotten trash??? I'm not sure if it was a bigfoot or not but it might be worth checking out. We were only there for about 15 minutes as it was starting to rain hard and the clouds were moving in and we couldn't see for hunting.","off 530 at the gas station, go up road 18 follow it up till you see the sign for road 1855, stay on this road and follow it all the way to the top of the ridge.

"I was driving on the North Cascades Highway (HWY 20) traveling east across the pass. It was close to twilight and it was clear and cold. While close to Rainy Pass (maybe a bit before), I see something that strikes me as not normal. It is about 1/4 mile up the highway on the side of the road. At first, I think that it is a large man wearing dark, winter clothing. As I got closer, I see that it was clearly not a man. But just before I got a better look, it slipped down the side of the road into the ravine. And that was when I knew what I had just seen. The way it moved was sylph-like. Almost as if it shimmered away. I looked back to where it had been, and it had completely disappeared. Now, if that isn't enough for you, there's more. About two miles further up the mountain pass, I saw another. It was a little smaller, but moved in the same graceful manner as it quickly went down the side of the mountain out of my view. The leaves on the tree that it had been next to still gently shook as I drove by. I cannot say with any surety what these creatures looked like exactly. But they were definitely not bears - too tall and far too graceful. They were not human - too graceful and quick. They were both dark though. If they were at all reddish, I did not notice. They both seemed to be very dark brown. The smaller one darker than the bigger one. If I was to guess size, I would say the larger one was 6'4"" - 6'8"" and probably around 250 - 300 lean pounds. The smaller was perhaps 6'0? And around 200 lbs maybe? The thing that was so completely out of the ordinary, was the manner in which they moved. I have never seen something so large move so fluidly.

"On a hike from Barlow Pass through Monte Cristo up to Silverlake my girlfriend and I had a strange experience. On the lower part of poodle dog pass there is a set of steep switchbacks in the trail. It was logged a few years before but was too steep to see above us on the trail. All of a sudden verything got real quiet. All the birds stopped singing. Then we heard a whooping noise. It started about 100 yards away above us on the hillside. We stopped and listened. The noise continued about every 2 minutes and got closer and closer. Once it got within about 30 yards away directly above us, it was really loud. We could smell something that was like a dirty wet dog smell. I pulled my sidearm. I did not remember ever hearing anything like this before and was concerned we were about to be attacked by something big. We sat waiting on the trail for about 5 minutes after the last noise. I was scanning the hillside above us but could not see or hear any movement. The birds started singing again and the smell went away. My girlfriend has less time in the woods than I so she asked me what that was. I calmly stated it was ""just a bigfoot, but he's gone now"". I was kind of kidding to make her relax but not sure I was wrong. We slowly continued up the trail. It was dry hard gravel and dirt so there were no tracks. We did not see anything so we went on up to the lake and had a good time. Once we got home I went to the BFRO site and listened to the sound recordings. One of them was exactly what we heard. The hairs on my neck stood up. What ever made that noise in the recording was what we heard. Also I thought the smell could be some type of plant that smelled like a dog and that was why it was called poodle dog pass. I looked around at the plants but did not see any that smelled like that wet dog. At the top of the trail near the lake there is some stinky plants but they are different than what we smelled.","It took place on the lower part of the Silverlake trail out of Monte Cristo town site.

"A college friend and I where camping just out of Index. We got up on a late damp Saturday morning about 10:30. We decided to take our cameras and [get] some pictures of the wilderness. I [have] lived in Washington my whole life and spent a lot time in the woods with my father. He moved here from Tennessee and was excited to see the wilderness of Washington. We spent a lot of time around the North Fork of the Skykomish that day. About 3:00ish we went back to camp and chose to go down a part of the road we camped on that had been blocked off by small trees that had fallen across (it looked like it had not been used for a long time), in [the] hope [of] finding some cool river shots. We headed south down the road thru the damp brush about a 1/4-mile. As we were walking in the area I noticed some small tree that where broke off at about 8 to 9 foot height and 4 to 6 in dia., at the break. It made me curious but I didn't say anything to my buddy. Then about a hundred and fifty yards or so, (give or take) we walked across a soft area in the road. At first I saw [only one] footprint but looked again, it was big and other than the ones we left it was the only one. It looked like the right footprint but no others, we found the soil was too firm. I asked my friend to put his foot next to it to compare. He wears a size 10 1/2 to 11 this was much bigger. I repeat, much bigger.

"From 1997~ 2003 I lived in Snohomish, Washington, located near the top of Cathcart Hill which I think is about 350 ft  above sea level, maybe higher. It also was all forested west of there for 5 square miles until they developed it all over a short period of time.  Now it is only forested to the east. I had heard many calls during the development of all the land near me. I suspected Bigfoot but didn't know what it sounded like at the time. Also, a strange thing happened around my house. When I smoked outside at night I would hear what sounded like an elephant smashing through the ten feet tall blackberry bushes towards me. It scared a friend if mine so bad when he went outside to pee and it screamed a blood curdling scream from the bushes. So these things happened for years.  Then one night I came around the corner driving north on Snohomish Ave. towards my road coming home with a friend and right before my road there was a swamp, I came around the bend and saw eye shine so I slowed to a crawl so not to hit what it was. Then I inched closer and it came across the road, I thought it was a pony at first then I saw its size was disproportionate. Its back end was taller than the front.on all fours. It turned and looked at us right before it went into the darkness and I thought its face reminded me of a sloth. I still didn't know what I'd seen. It wasn't dark brown. It was a light color like grey or maybe white. Then I pulled forward and my friend and I rolled down the side window and tried to see where it went and we smelled a strong sulfur smell, but we couldn't see anything and we got scared and went home. I tried to look up if we have some species of giant sloth in Washington. Now days I've been better educated about Bigfoot from watching shows on TV and I'm very sure that is what we saw that night. My friend was convinced it was Bigfoot that night but I wasn't sure because it was on all 4's & wasn't brown or black. Now I know, that its the only thing it could've been. I think it was running out of habitat and with many other wildlife was driven east thru that neighborhood. It's unknown if it is there still as I moved a long time ago and haven't felt stalked since.",,Snohomish County,Washington,Summer,Report 44489: Witness recalls unknown animal seen crossing road near Snohomish,47.8465,-122.1357,7/1/2003,44489,Class B,c290hwpqpf,64.09,57.64,51.19,46.41,0.68,0.58,0.06,0.0007,0.88,rain,1018.39,Mostly cloudy throughout the day.,7,10,359,2.68
"My niece was living with us at the time of the sighting.  She was a senior in high school.  Our house is about 6 miles out of town and in 1987 when the incident occurred, it was very rural, though now it has become quite developed.  The school buses didn't go down the side roads so kids would have to walk to the closest main road.  We live not too far off the bus route.  The neighbor girl drove to school and she would often stop and give my niece a ride as she was walking to the bus stop.  On this particular morning she had just gotten in the neighbor's car when about 50 yards ahead, this creature came out of the swamp area on the right side of the road, paused in a crouching position, started crossing, then dashed very quickly across the road and into the woods.  She said she turned to the neighbor girl and said, ""What the hell was that?""  To which the girl answered ""I don't know!""  She says it was about the size of a bear, brown in color, but was definitely not a bear.  It started crossing the road walking like a gorilla (she even wondered if it could have been an orangutan or some kind of ape), then it ran the rest of the way very fast on all fours.  The whole incident happened so fast that she was not able to see much of the hands or feet.  She described it to me as being like an ape, but also sloth-like.  I said unless there had been an escaped primate from a traveling circus, we just don't have them in Washington.  She said it had hair covering its entire body and she noticed hair hanging from its arms.  She also heard from the swamp a whoop-whoop-whoop sound.  Thinking back she realizes that she had heard that sound coming from the swamp before, but thought it was some kind of bird.  It ran into an area of hundreds of wooded acres which eventually dip into the valley beyond (we are up on a plateau).  There is a ravine in the middle of this area.  To the right, past the swamp and as the crow flies there is Woods Creek about a mile or more away.  The deer pass by this area headed toward water at Woods Creek.  My niece said that she and the neighbor girl didn't say a word all the way to school and when they arrived she said again ""What WAS that?"" They both were dumbfounded.  She said it gave her the creeps and she felt scared.  We have talked about it on and off for years trying to think what it could have been.  A couple of weeks ago we sat down and I made a sketch while she guided me.  Actually she had to modify and finish it because I just could not figure out what she meant about how the head, chest and face looked.  When I saw her alterations I thought no wonder she was scared.

"My family's property bordered a small creek, the other side of the creek basicly was the north central cascades. An area composed of huge tracts of USFS land mixed with clearcuts. The creek supports a modest run of salmon, my dogs and I were out to see if any fish had made it up into ""our"" part of the river. The field we were walking in is bordered by very thick brush that grows along the fence.  Beyond that lies the creek. The far bank is 20 feet high, covered with cedar, hemlock and brush. We were walking through the field when the most earth shattering sound stopped us dead in our tracks. The sound was best described as a ""hoot"", but delivered with incredible volume...HOOOOOOTTT!!! We stopped dead in our tracks. I knew exactly what I was hearing. Frozen, the feeling of terror was overwhelming. This lasted around 5 seconds, when the second HOOOOOOTT!! rang out. The plan was clear, we ran. Fast. As we ran, the final HOOOOOOT!! came from behind us, streaking thru thigh high fieldgrass, I was sure that I was seconds away from having my arms ripped off by a mountain devil. I can laugh now about how I felt, but after talking with other friends who have had run-ins with Sasquach, the common thread in our experiences seems to be uncontrolable fear. Like being hunted.

"Submitted on behalf of the witnesses, husband and wife, with their permission. This was the couple's first summer in WA and they had out of state guests. They wanted to show them NW wilderness and took them to Hannon Lake which was difficult to get to on a beat up logging road. The couple, a brother, and cousin rowed around the lake together in a boat while others remained on shore. The boat passed in view of a cove while still in site of the shore party. A creature was standing in knee deep water in the back of the cove facing outward but bent over splashing water on its chest the way a person tests the temperaure before getting in. Someone said ""WHAT IS THAT?"" Altogether the boaters looked to shore and the creature straightened and looked directly at them. Without hesitation or hurry it turned and walked out of the lake and into the woods. The boaters rowed over to the shore intending to see what might be found. They abandoned the effort when the boat got into murky, weed choked water. The shore was covered by dense trees and was creepy under the circumstances. The sighting distance was about 100 yds. The creature is described as having a uniform length of thick auburn-brown hair all over except for the mouth and eyes. It was 7+ ft. in height with a massive, muscular bulk and proportional build.

"The year was 1993. I was employed with the US Forest Service in Skykomish, WA on the Mt. Baker Snoqualmie NF. I was part of a wildland firefighting crew on the Skykomish Ranger dist. I should point out that I grew up in mountainous regions and did lots of hunting and hiking all my life.  My father was a hunting guide when I was a young boy and I'm very familiar with all species of Northwest wildlife, tracks, sounds, smells, etc. On the night of the 22nd of July, the district encountered many lighting strikes. The following morning we (firefighters) met with officials to determine what areas were hit and to find out who would be going where. We split-up in teams of two. After reaching the end of the Beckler River drainage  I saw the smoke and the area of concern which was high on a steep, thick, north facing hillside.  Me and my partner geared up and started climbing the mountain. The terrain was VERY rugged, steep, rocky, and thick with Devil's Club & Salmon Berry brush.  After hiking approx 2 1/2 to 3 hours through this terrain, moving slow due to the steepness, we finally reached the fire.  We worked on the fire for about 2 hours then started our decent back our truck.  We took a slightly different route than the way we came up. We were about 200 yards down from where we had been working when my partner (Joe) slipped and dropped his shovel, it slid down the steep hill about 100 feet or so.  I offered to go down and get it for him.  When I climbed down to the shovel, it had landed on a rocky outcropping and I had to carefully scale the terrain to get down to the ledge. When I got the shovel, I noticed a small cave entrance that had brush surrounding it.  As soon as I got closer to inspect, I could smell a foul odor coming from inside.   I shined my light inside the cave and could tell it was larger inside.  I wasn't able to see how deep it went back with my light.  The odor kept me from going any further in. I had heard of the foul odor associated with bigfoots and immediatley became uncomfortable.  It was an overall eerie feeling. I yelled up to Joe that I had found a cave and it really stunk.  He seemed to just want to keep heading back to the truck so he continued down the path we were on before I climbed down for the shovel. I was looking down the mountain to see how I was going to get down off the ledge and connect with the trail we were on before.  As I was standing there, I saw out of the corner of my eye, a bowling ball-sized boulder came flying from over my head.  It crashed and rolled into a ravine about 10 or 15 yards downhill from me.  I yelled back up the hill to Joe, ""Did you throw that!!?"".  When he said ""No!!"", I realized that he had already walked away from where he had been and was now way to the left of my location. It was at that moment I realized that rock COULD NOT have been thrown by him, nor did it roll down the hill because I would have heard it crashing down from above me.  I then looked back uphill from where the rock had come from just in time to see ANOTHER rock coming from above me.  The second rock hit the ground more to the left and below me.  I was visually scanning the area where the rock had come from when I heard movement in the brush.  I crouched down and watched the area.  I then saw a dark, hairy figure walking upright along the side of the mountain, away from me.  It was always partially obscured by brush and trees so I couldn't really tell color or exact heighth, but I would guess about 7-9 ft. tall. I watched it for a few seconds then yelled to Joe ""I see it!"", I think I said ""I think it's a bigfoot!"".  As soon as I yelled that, I looked back up and it was dead still and silent.  I felt like it stopped and hid when I yelled because I didn't see or hear anything else. At this point I really wanted to get out of there so I side-hilled over to Joe and we quickly decended back to our vehicle.  We were both very freaked out and talked about it all the way back to the ranger station where we reported the incident to our wildlife biologist and other officials at the ranger district. I was later contacted by someone at the U of W who wanted to interview me and have me take him to the site.  I moved from the area shortly afterwards and I never took him there.  Which is why I'm submitting this report.  I want people to know my story.",[Beckler River Road area ; Internal database (FLATS) has more specifics.],Snohomish County,Washington,Summer,Report 12929: Daylight encounter with firefighter near Skykomish,47.79222,-121.1958,11/3/2005,12929,Class B,c23zfh7cv5,29.37,28.345,27.32,28.9,1,,0.06,0.02,0.96,snow,,Snow (4–7 in.) throughout the day.,0,,29,0.22
"About 12:30 PM that afternoon (October 13) one witness who had just arrived mentioned when I arrived about 15 minutes after him that he heard a lot of commotion out by the Sauk River that sounded like someone was out hunting with hounds and they were baying like crazy, possibly having something tree'd. This is not uncommon in this area as some locals do hunt cougar and bear with hounds here. Although it is illegal to kill cougars they do ""tree"" them for sport. Later that evening around 5:00PM the same witness had gone down the bank by Bachman Creek to relieve himself and when he came back commented that something seemed a little strange and there was a different odor in the air down by the creek and felt a little ""creeped out"" by it. We started a campfire at about 7:30 PM. The campfire is located about 20 feet from the edge of a creek running through a sapling filled older riverbed. At 8:20 PM, as we sat around the fire conversing, a distinct, loud, and very close vocalization occurred that literally stunned us all into silence. There were two distinct parts to the sound and overall lasted only 15-20 seconds. The first part lasted about 12-15 seconds and consisted of a whooing/moaning that was very distinct and close, right at the far edge of the creek I would guess. Followed by a 2-5 second pause and then a booming, paralyzing scream that lasted about 5 seconds. The reactions within the group varied with two of us quickly putting the fire between us and whatever was making this sound, the others just sitting in silence. We immediately heard movement in the dark…not loud but obviously something moving from left to right on the far side of the creek (maybe 30 feet away). Then nothing. One of the witnesses who has lived, fished and hunted in this area for over 40 years swears he has never heard anything even close to this vocalization…and really does not want to again. The next day we found no obvious sign in the creek immediately out from the campfire. Leaves had started covering the ground so it would have been difficult to find any sign. The next day a friend and I hiked up the creek and river approximately ¼-1/2 mile and found a fresh sapling broken/twisted off at about 10 ft. and the top section thrown out onto the rocks at the river edge about 15 ft away. At the river edge, in a sandy area we found barefoot prints…small, maybe 9” but with strange toes. Not human? Who runs around on a river barefooted in October with temps in the near freezing? After doing a closer survey of the area we found several different sets of tracks in what looked to be 3 or 4 different sizes with the largest being about 17”.

"Me and a really good friend were up On Green Mountain, Which is 10 miles or so up Mt.Loop Hwy. When you go up the mountain you can either Go right at the fork in the road , or go left up the hill. We went left. We were going to this really  nice look out point, we were planning on camping out there for the night. When we arrived at the spot we set up our fire, and we were just admiring the view, I kept hearing noises like branches or twigs, or something of that nature popping and breaking. I just thought some deer or rabbits, then they started getting alot closer and very quickly. I started to get a little uncomfortable, My friend Pat is deaf so he didnt have a clue what was going on. He just kept asking me what I was listning to, and why I kept looking up the road. So Id say about 2 minutes went by I had heard nothing, But I had this strange feeling that something was watching us, I paid no mind to it. Then out of nowhere a stick came flying over top of the truck and went tumbling down the hill. OK now Im starting to get nervous, My friend pat still has no clue what is happening but he sees that im getting a little distressed, and Right As I was telling him what was going on. A rock about the size basketball, a little smaller smashed  hard right in front of our fire, I began to get very  very uneasy. I didnt notice any smell or anything, the wind was blowing at us, So he must have been downwind, We packed out of there in about 10 seconds and I have yet to return to green mountain. There was no explination of the branches or rock crashing or rolling down. there was no sound just all of a sudden a rock landed about 8 feet from us. ?????

"Vocalization at close range with no actual sighting. Sunning at end of lake where the trail becomes brushy.  Suddenly without any other sign/signal of someone/something being there, there was a loud vocalization starting with a low pitch howl increasing to high pitch howl almost ending in a high pitch hoop sound. Then dead silence. I jumped up and couldn't see anything but from the lakeshore the trail was pretty obscured and the woods thick. Sound was very close- I estimate 50-75 feet at most.  I grabbed my belongings and got out of there fast hiking all the way back to my truck without stopping except to look back and listen a few times briefly.  Beyond spooky, and puzzling. I have listened to many animal recordings online and nothing native to or not native to WA state sounds even close to this. It does sound strikingly similar to a couple of the recordings I have listened to on the website. I have no doubt I heard something that day that is outside of what species we know to exist in this part of the world. I took me this long because I can't stop thinking of it and when in the woods it has changed the way I view hiking alone, more wary and alert  now, sometimes afraid even.","Goat Lake off Mt.

"I grew up in a very outdoor environment and spent a substantial amount of my time growing up in and around woods, day or night. I’ve lived in WA my whole life and had in interest in crypto-zoology as a child but had never taken any mention of Bigfoot seriously until I had my encounter. I was living at my parent’s house that summer (2009), and spent many days visiting a friend who lived about 10min away on foot on a trail. He lived off of 228th St SE and about a block up the hill from 57th Ave, and I lived a little off of 224th St SE and 45th Ave. I could make my way to his house on this trail through a lot of heavily wooded land. If I started from the end of my driveway i’d take a left onto 45th Ave, and continue past 224th St down a driveway to a culdesac off of the main road. This went down a relatively steep hill, then turned left up a steep hill and leveled out at the tree line, which was where the entrance to the trail was. Winding my way up and downhill through the woods, I’d pop out most the way down 53rd Ave, N of its intersection with 228th St. I’d then take a right to walk down 53rd Ave, take a left onto 228th St and walk downhill until I was at my friend’s place. It was obviously used because the brush underfoot was consistently stamped flat, but in all my time living in that area the only people I ever saw on it were myself and any friends who might’ve taken the trip with me (maps.google.com, type in 50th Ave and 228th St SE) Having spent that night, like many before and after, relaxing on my friends patio with several other regulars, I got up, put out my cigarette, said my goodbyes and left. I walked out his driveway, took a left onto 228th, and walked towards 53rd. The night was moonless and so it was very dark; there were streetlights, but each of them was separated by 70-100ft or more and was only on one side of the road. It was probably around 1 in the morning, and it was normal for me to not see any cars on my short trip on the main road. Taking a right onto 53rd and then a left onto the trail most the way down it, I entered the trail. It was very, very still but the normal sounds were there for night time; some insects, the occasional rustle in the bushes of a smaller animal, nothing out of the ordinary. It was almost pitch black because of the tree cover, but I knew the trail like the back of my hand and walked confidently forward. Then it happened. Behind me to my right, probably about 20ft away, I heard movement in the brush and ferns. I didn’t even realizing I was hearing anything until it lasted more than a few seconds…and I realized it was moving in the same direction as me and breaking sizable tree branches underfoot. I stopped and listened. In a moment, the rustling came to a stop. I could hear faint, slow, deep breathing, like that of a large animal; it wasn’t loud enough to be from exertion, but seemed natural, as if whatever was behind the lung capacity was big enough to encompass several of my breaths in one of its own. I waited for about a minute and didn’t hear anything except the breathing, slow and even. I took another step and started down the trail again. And again, something moved through the woods after me, keeping pace and tempo with my movements. Sure enough I could hear ferns, ivy, blackberry bushes and the like being pulled or pushed aside, and that slow breathing started again. I stopped again, and this went on for another 5 or so minutes before I reached the trailhead, scared out of my wits. I still hadn’t heard any individual footsteps, hadn’t seen it or smelled anything; I don’t remember which way the wind was blowing, if there was one. I’d decided that once I hit the tree line, I’d make a run for it. So as I walked evenly up, followed in the same way I had been for several previous minutes, and trusting my years as a track runner (which I was fairly talented at), came to a stop and then bolted into a sprint down the hill. At moment later whatever was following me decided to move as well. As I pounded down the hill towards the right turn up 45th Ave, it too broke the trees from where I had, the gravel and then the asphalt. Its breathing became a series of low growls, almost a series of calls that sounded hoarse and aggressive. It was loud; loud enough to echo off the surrounding trees. But the moment it hit the gravel I knew something was wrong; of all the animals I’ve ever seen in their natural habitat that are native to western WA, none of them sounded like this one did. There was no lope, stride, or gallop that resembled how this thing sounded when it moved. One of the more intense memories of this incident was hearing that noise; distinctive impacts with the ground on not four, but two feet, and the smacking of bare feet on asphalt when it hit the driveway. That was quite unsettling, to say the least. But then another thing happened to my dismay and confusion; instead of following me down the driveway on the asphalt, it crossed back onto the asphalt and then into the woods to my right diagonally away from me. My first sensation was relief, until I realized it had increased its speed drastically, and its calls rang out from the woods in my direction still. Rounding the corner to go up 45th to get to the street level (and where there were streetlights), I realized it was trying to cut me off by getting ahead of me by cutting through the back yards of my neighbors across the street from me. Realizing this, I got a huge adrenaline rush as I absorbed the severity of having this thing, whatever it was, between my house and I. Running as fast as I could, I cleared the hill and started running on the flat towards my driveway off the road a little farther down. At the same time, behind me to my right, I heard this thing pound across a neighbor’s grass yard; heavy, distinct, single impacts of a two-legged animal. I’d been able to beat it to the road, but I wasn’t out of trouble yet. As I raced along the road it crossed their yard, leapt the 10ft ditch and landed 4 feet below on the asphalt road behind me all without stopping, tripping or stumbling once. It had kept on growling/calling at me, and guessing from the time it took for it to reach the road from their backyard I figure this thing couldn’t have been moving any slower than 20-25MPH; and I’ve been clocked at sprinting 22MPH before (not including adrenaline). As it pounded after me I heard once again the distinct sound of two individual feet contacting the ground. As I took a turn onto my driveway, my dog Gus, a purebred Airedale Terrier, started going off barking. I skidded around the corner, short (not including adrenaline). As it pounded after me I heard once again the distinct sound of two individual feet contacting the ground. As I took a turn onto my driveway, my dog Gus, a purebred Airedale Terrier, started going off barking. I skidded around the corner, shortly followed by my pursuer, and got to my house with Gus running up to meet me. He was in full sprint; legs outstretched, heckles up, growling fiercely (and he was a gentle giant, he only acted that way towards squirrels/coyotes/raccoons). He must’ve seen what was after me and it stopped him dead in his tracks; he went from a sprint to 0 in about 3-5ft and started barking extravagantly. I stopped as I heard whatever this creature was stop and wheeled around to look back for the 1st time. Away from the streetlights on a moonless night with old pine/fir trees looming overhead, my eyes couldn’t see a damn thing. But I did see the gravel it must’ve kicked up by coming to such a fast halt land near my feet and felt it bonce off my shoes and lower legs as I was turning around. The three of us were all frozen in place for a single, quiet moment. Gus was growling, hair raised, ready to defend me. I was panting, standing straight and looking straight into the darkness. And whatever this creature was couldn’t have been more than 15ft in front of me, growling and breathing deeply enough to raise the hair on the back of my neck again even after being chased the way I was. Gus and I looked at each other at the same time and I said “stay” with all the gravity I could muster in my voice. He looked back into the darkness and continued growling as I dashed the garage, grabbed a hatchet and ran back. I returned to the same scene; Gus and this thing having a growl-off. I unsheathed the hatchet and stood ready, waiting, searching the blackness or any sign of this thing. But all I could hear was its breathing and the intense sensation that we were making eye contact; that this thing and I were holding each other with our eyes for several minutes. Then suddenly I heard crashing and rustling in the bushes moving away from me for a good 30 seconds, and Gus relaxed. We both went inside and I didn’t let him out at night for a week after that; after dark he’d sit by the windows and occasionally growl as if he’d seen something. He didn’t even do that to any of the other animals he’d normally go Terrier on. And each time he did I’d step outside and listen, and the woods would be filled with an unnatural quietness, or stillness. Since that night I can confidently say that I was stalked, followed, and then chased by a Bigfoot, that then was dissuaded by the presence of my dog and the light of the house so near.",,Snohomish County,Washington,Summer,Report 30670: Night time foot race with an unseen animal near Woodinville,47.7925,-122.1676,7/6/2009,30670,Class B,c23puh272x,65.38,59.94,54.5,50.54,0.71,0.74,0.48,0,0,,1015.74,Mostly cloudy throughout the day.,6,10,187,3.72
"I was out riding my bike and came to the logging road and started walking because you don't ride bikes where cougars dwell.  So I hiked for a while enjoying the sights and the trail forks in a y-shape and I took a left and walked up the hill.  After I got to the top of the hill I walked down a little further and at my 2 o'clock I heard a large branch snap like how a twig snaps under a man's foot and the brush crashed and I heard what sounded like a baseball bat hit a tree.  When I looked at where the noise came from and I saw to my horror a rock come towards me from out of the bushes and my eyes caught the hand throwing the rock, and when I noticed the hand I saw it jump in the air and do a 180 spin so it would be faced away from me when it landed and I swear to god it threw the rock so freakin hard that the entire rock didn't spin at all when it was being chucked.  It bonked the stump on the side of the trail and I kept staring at it because I thought at first it was a ghost or mabye somebody behind the stump that I just saw do a ninja move. Then I realized that it was facing away from me towards the swampy brush because the stump I was looking had a muscley buttocks and I could see on the top of the stump what looked like a v shape tuft of hair similar to Howard the Duck.  I was yellin and shoutin at it but it just stood their and kept looking away from me, and I knew that this thing is not going to move unless I go over there and at that point I left the forest by going back where I came from.",Removed at the request of the witness.,Snohomish County,Washington,Spring,Report 37885: Daylight encounter while hiking on the Tulalip Indian Reservation,48.10255,-122.2763,6/10/2010,37885,Class A,c2919sc1et,61.73,56.485,51.24,50.08,0.84,0.96,0.94,0.0008,0.5,rain,1017.13,Overcast throughout the day.,5,9.79,248,0.47
"I was hiking, with my dog, at Wallace Falls State Park on 4/26/11. I started the hike at about 11:30am and there were only two other vehicles in the entire parking lot. I had hiked passed the upper portion of the falls, following an old logging road up to Wallace Lake. I only saw one other hiker coming down from the falls lookout. At approximately 2pm, my dog and I were walking towards the lake (it was about 1.5 miles away). We heard a very strange, humanoid yell come from across a marshy bog area. We both were taken by surprise and stopped. I looked across the bog area up towards the thick forest on the other side (about 75 yards away). I couldnt see any clothing of a hiker or potential body of a humanoid creature. The sound however was very interesting. I've spent many hours hiking the Washington state forests. I know what certain animals sound like when calling for a mate or calling to signal a warning. This noise was different. It was comparable to a person yelling directly and loudly ""yoouuuuuu!!!"". My dog and I stopped dead in our tracks and listened. About a minute went by and I heard the same noise again from the same area. The loud and direct ""yooouuuuu!!"". It was very strange. I'm positive that whatever made the noise was either a human toying with me, or some humanoid creature warning me of its presence. Being miles up alone in the wilderness, I didn't want to John Wayne across a bog into thick brush to investigate. It was the first time I've ever heard such a unique sound while out in the forest. I will never forget the look of confusion on my dog's face either. I'm sure mine looked the same as well.",Wallace Falls State Park.

"On September 1st, 2011 I was camping up in the beautiful Cascade Mountains of Washington State with my friend Dave (my name is Dave as well). We got there early on Thursday to get the spot we wanted. It was for us the start of the Labor Day weekend. We had set up camp and drove up an old logging road to get our firewood for the night. There is a bridge close to our campsite. We had supper and relaxed around the campfire. At about 10:30 that night I decided to grab a flashlight and go looking around the area across the bridge. I really had not planned on looking for Bigfoot as I was busy with the logistics of putting this camping trip together. I am a true believer in Sasquatch, and read Bigfoot stories all the time(ask my wife). As I cleared the bridge there is a dead-end road on the right that goes down for about a quarter mile or so. I know this because I have been down there. The road is gated at the top with a pipe gate. In the middle of the gate is a red reflector. I could not see the reflector because something was standing in front of it. I had shined my just regular flashlight, with about ¾ battery power down this road. What I did see was a pair of big yellow eyes, looking back at me. I FROZE. I remember thinking: Oh My GOD! I noticed that the right eye was much brighter than the left eye. I thought that perhaps there was some hair hanging down over the inside of the left eye. Or maybe it had an injury. I then noticed how far apart the eyes were. And how high up from the ground they were. Actually they were roughly even with mine, but the road there sloped down a bit. About four feet or more! I’m 5’8” on a good day. This “thing” would have towered over me! The creature was either dark brown or black, as I could not make out any body or head features at all. Just those yellow eyes. There was no odor at all. The air was perfectly still. It made no noise either. I processed all this very quickly. If it would have growled at me it would have been laundry time! We stared at each other for maybe 10-12 seconds. It seemed to kind of lean side to side a little. Without moving its feet. Then the eyes dropped down a little and made a big circle. Pause. Then another circle same as the first. Like an owl, only way bigger. I thought that he had put his hands on his knees maybe. Kind of like I have seen on TV of apes moving.It looked at me for 3 more seconds and I lost it. Not knowing what this thing was going to do next, I took off running to the middle of the bridge and spun around. Every hair on my body was standing up. It did not follow me. I was not surprised. But I was also very happy. I was panting. Mostly from adrenaline, I think! I hustled back to camp and told Dave what happened. I said “Let’s go back over there. “Grab your camera” (a digital with a strong flash and video+audio). I was very excited. I knew that this could be a chance of a lifetime to get this thing on film. You have to understand that in my mind, there was nothing else that this creature could be than a REAL Sasquatch. I completely believe it to this day. Anyways, Dave Cannot find his camera. After we looked for a couple of minutes or so I get pissed and said, or words to the effect “Let’s go while this thing is still in the same county”! So we get to the bridge and walk fast at first, then slow way down being quiet. I whispered “ You watch the left side and I’ll watch this side. We’ll try to get both flashlights on it at the same time”. Dave’s flashlight was about the same as mine). It wasn’t in front of the gate anymore. That didn’t surprise me. What I did see was the red reflector. I did not even know it was even there the 1st time. But there it was. It would have stuck out like a sore thumb! It was blocked by the Bigfoot.On Dave’s side was a pull-out. It was empty. (The next night some people ‘Camped’ there). I told Dave “Shine your light up the road”. There HE was! On my side walking slowly towards us. He had the exact same eyes. The left one was messed up, just like the 1st time! Dave and I were about 10-12 feet apart. I said “Dave, THERE HE IS! Do you see him? He’s coming Dave! There he is!”. Both of our lights had shined on this things face at the same time. Only for like 3 seconds or so. But it lit his head up!  The head did not look pointed to me, like many people have reported. It was really BIG though. I was slowly backing up as I watched it walking towards us. “Don’t you see it ?” “No” he says. I was backing up slowly out of fear as I’m watching the eyes move up and down rhythmically. . Well, it turns out that Dave can’t see much in bright sunlight.  At night he is basically following the sound of your voice. So he can’t find his camera at the critical time; and I have no witness to this incidence, even though he was right there with me! I love the guy. But FU$%! So I get scared and take off running to the middle of the bridge again, with Dave behind me. The only reason he is running is because I was. You ever hear the joke about never going Grizzly Bear hunting with a friend who can out-run you? Well I out-weight Dave and he had trouble keeping up!   It was HUGE!  Also, although the road was going up hill, it was very straight and flat. I was familiar with this stretch of road, having camped there many times. And this gave me a great idea of how tall this thing was. When I say it was pushing ten feet tall, I feel confident that this is an accurate judgment of its true height. And there were NO tree branches there at all to justify an owl sitting on a limb. If it was an owl, it would have to be 10 feet tall. So we quickly get back to camp. Dave of course, finds his camera. Under his sleeping bag. We jumped into the van and shot across the bridge. Of course we could not find him. I knew he was just inside the trees on one side or the other. It was as dark as the inside of a Buffalo on a moon-less night. The next morning I walked across the bridge to the top of the road on the right. I walked up to the pipe gate and stood there. Right exactly where HE stood. I paced it off, and it was roughly 45 yards to where I stood when I first spotted him. Boy, I sure will bring a massive candle power flashlight next time! And have a camera ready as well. But you get your chances when they happen. I was not prepared! One thing I haven’t mentioned. At the time this all happened, I had truly forgotten that in my tent were my two guns. I had my 9mm, plus a 12 gauge sawed-off double barreled shotgun(side by side and barely legal) loaded with 00 BUCK. It had never occurred to me to shoot this guy. I had completely forgotten that I was heavily armed! When he was walking down the road towards us, he, in retrospect, was just kind of shooing us away I think. I think of him as being a gentle giant! He very easily could have run us down and killed us. I feel blessed that they are out there. He did not harass us or threaten us in any way. Other than just leisurely walking towards us and scaring the CRAP out of me!I will go back there this summer,more prepared for sure. STOP!!!!!! - I haven’t told anyone yet, except for now. I also have a Class B report that happened back in 1975, up it Whatcom County near the Canadian border. This encounter was truly TERRIFIYING!

"Me and my girlfreind went camping up in the MT. Loop area in snohomish county and when we got to our campsite, we saw a couple large footprints along the side of the dirt road next to were we parked, i immediately disregarged it being a bigfoot and figured that it was someone with enormous feet running around barefoot prior to us getting there. as it started to get darker we both had heard what sounded like someone yelling in a deep voice then turned into what sounded like a low tone groan and then stopped, this happened at about 9:30 pm. my girlfreind started to get scared so i told her it was probably just a bear making its sound and i lit a fire and we sat around the fire and talked for a few hours. once we we wanted to go to bed, we climbed into the back of the jeep and as i was closing the back door we heard the same sound again but allot closer to our area. after the noise stopped and about an hour went by we had heard loud rusttling sounds in the bushes on the upper part of the hill on the other side of the road and very loud footfalls and we also heard something very large splashing in the river which was i would say 30 feet from our jeep. we both shined flashlights out the windows but couldnt see anything, as we were doing that a vehicle came down the road and slammed their brakes on just passed our camp site. we heard them get out of their vehicle and started talking so i got out and went to them and asked if everything was okay, and their response to my question was that some massive hairy thing ran across the road right infront of them which they almost hit. they said oh it could of been bigfoot jokingly until i told them the sounds that we were hearing all night and they said that we should probably go then cause that sounds really creepy and that theyve heard of reports in the area of a ""bigfoor"" in the past. now thats kind of the breif rundown of what happened that night, but i am still a skeptic about it but anything is possible, i am millitary i serve in the US army and have seen allot of crazy things so it wouldnt surprise me that its real, but im still a skeptic.

It starts off winding through woods and while curving to the right we saw this gigantic light brown to dark tan hairy figure cross from right to left.  I couldn't see the head because it was above the area illuminated by the truck lights, but I saw that the shoulders were at least three feet across, and at the shoulders it was at least 8-8.5 feet tall, and while it ran I could see the arm/shoulder movement and the thighs move as well.  With how steep the area it was that it went down, and how wooded and rainy it was I don't think a human could navigate its way down there as quickly as it did, because by the time I had stopped and gotten out it was gone, but you could hear the crashing of it moving through the brush and trees.",North from Marysville on 67th to Hilltop Road.

"I just found this website so I am going to tell you about an incident that happened several years ago. I was about 14 years old and in the Boy Scouts. My troop was from Portland, Or., and we were attending a Boy scout summer camp near Spokane somewhere....I can't remember the exact name of the camp...but it was near Spokane. The different troops lived in various campsites ringed around a lake and a main lodge. My troop had one of the furthest campsites from the lodge and the lake. During the daytime, our campsite was normally empty. For the first few days everything was fine and then things started coming up missing and evidence that someone had been going through our belongings was evident. Needless to say, one morning I woke up and felt sick. I was given permission to stay in my tent and rest while everyone else left and partook of the morning festivities. Well, I was resting in my tent and thinking about what would happen if the thing or person going through our camp showed up while I was there alone. Then in the distance I heard the voices of boys from my troop making there way back to camp. One boy was in the lead of the group and just about back into our camp when I heard him yell ""Hey, what are you doing?"" I knew I was the only person in camp and I was not visible as I was in my tent...I darted out of my tent and looked down the trail to my right and saw my troop mate...then something flashed by to my left. It was upright on two feet and all I can really say is that it was large and brown. At the edge of our camp it darted into the brush and proceeded up a small incline. Whatever it was moved with incredible speed and ease through this thick underbrush. It stopped at the crest of the hill and looked back at us....Then we being young and dumb started into the brush...and it turned and disappeared. I am not sure what I saw...I do know it was in two legs and moved quicker than any human I have ever seen, through some very, thick brush.",It is a Boy scout camp that is on a lake in Eastern Washington...that is all I can remember about it.,Spokane County,Washington,Summer,Report 10354: Boy scout observes large brown animal on two legs run by him,47.62769,-117.3606,2/15/2005,10354,Class A,c2kwcqke7u,35.43,26.12,16.81,12.58,0.6,0.17,0.24,0,0,,1028.82,Partly cloudy until afternoon.,2,10,352,0.55
"It was fall.  About 9 at night. Just getting dark.  A friend and I were camping on Mica Peak in Spokane County WA.  We decided to go for a quick hike just before dark.  We were walking an old logging road.  As we came around a right hand bend, we saw the outline of a man standing next to a small pine tree. The tree was only about 12 feet or so tall and Christmas tree shaped, but fairly sparse branches.  The ""man"" was standing to our right of the tree.  It was around 30 yards from us.  At this point it was getting too dark to make out much detail of the thing, but it was about 4 feet shorter than the tree, dark and wide.  The tree wasn't moving, but the ""man"" was swaying slowly from side to side.  We backed up slowly till we were around the corner out of sight before we turned and got back to camp as fast as we could to start a fire.  We were camped near a creek in a valley.  That night after sitting by the fire talking and playing guitars we went to bed.  While laying in the tent just about asleep, from back up near the logging road we had hiked, we heard screaching.  The only thing comparable I've ever heard were chimpanzees on tv. There were 5 or 6 screaching sounds in about 10 minutes and that was it. We laid in the tent holding our pistols most of the night, but didn't hear anything else.","On Mica Peak, WA",Spokane County,Washington,Fall,Report 47470: Grouse hunters have possible late evening sighting near Mica Peak,47.5505,-117.167,9/15/2010,47470,Class B,c2kwtb39ep,76.87,65.1,53.33,45.8,0.64,0.34,0.27,0,0,,1013.88,Mostly cloudy throughout the day.,5,9.76,140,0.27
"On the last day of hunting season just before dark my friend and I were walking slowly on an old logging road. We were heading through an area where a small spring crossed under the old road. The forest was very dense on one side of the road and clear cut 30+ years prior on the other side so there was alot of brush, but still quite open. Just then about 50 ft into the dense thicket above us we hear a very loud breathy yell followed by what sounded like a large stick hitting a tree. We were so close that we could feel the percussion in our chests from its yell, and the knocks echoed for miles. We both checked to make sure that our rifles were loaded not knowing what the noise was we make our way back to our spots we had chosen to sit until dark. Over the coarse of about an hour it yelled about 50-60 times following each yell with 1-2 wood knocks per yell.

"I am prompted to submit this story after reading several months ago on this website about the incident that took place in August, 1967 in the same area.  It has taken me a couple of months to decide to submit this report, but am now convinced that it may be helpful to you: I was an Infantry Lieutenant with the US Army in April, 1979 participating in a escape and evasion (E&E) course.  Our class was dropped off at the southern end of Weir Prairie in the South Rainier Training area late that afternoon.  The purpose was for us to break up into small teams and E&E north to the Nisqually Bridge.  We were given 24 hours to accomplish this and had to evade search teams on jeeps that were sent out to pursue and capture us. A relatively large group (about 10 men) chose to follow myself and my Platoon sergeant (name unknown) and we proceeded north along dirt roads as far as the intersection of roads 1 km northeast of Flander Lake.  There, we started to encounter jeeps patrolling the roads. We decided to leave the road 1 km north of this intersection and walk due west cross country to another dirt road that ran north-south.  About an hour and a half into our walk we began to worry that maybe we were lost. There was much dead fall and dense brush that slowed us down. My platoon sergeant walked ahead to scout out the area while we rested.  When he did not return a half hour later I went forward to find him. I'd walked about 100 meters when I heard noises  to my right front that sounded like heavy foot steps.  Thinking that our pursuers would not be off the road after us, I called out my sergeant's name.  A large, dark and hulking figure loomed up at the other end of a clearing about 50 feet in front of me and ran to my front for about 20 feet.  I only saw it for a moment before it disappeared into the woods.  I turned to go back to my patrol when my platoon sergeant appeared.  He asked me if that was me running around out there crashing in the bushes.  I told him ""no"", that maybe he saw and heard what I saw. We compared notes briefly and decided it was not a deer, a bear or another human.  From his angle, he only saw a dark form running away from him into the woods. We decided to say nothing to the others and proceeded on since whatever it was, it probably wanted nothing to do with us. We reached the other north-south road about 45 minutes later and continued to our destination without incident.  Later, at the end of course, I checked with the other E&E teams to compare routes and where they were at that time and found that the nearest team was well over two kms away. Over a year later, just before my platoon sergeant was ready to transfer to Germany, we talked about the incident.  Both of us were hunters and outdoorsmen.  Whatever it was, we were both convinced that it was a not a deer, a bear or another animal and the way it moved through the woods, not possibly another person.  Whoever it was definitely wanted to get away from us. I have trained in the same area off and on for quite a few years after and never saw or heard of anything similar until I read the August, 1967 report.  I have heard since that there are bear in the area, but I doubt that is what we saw that nite.","The incident took place at Fort Lewis, Washington in the Rainier Training.

"On wed march 20,2012 My 2, sons J and T, and 2 friends S and T along with myself, went out to target practice outside the town of Rainer, Wash. It was about 5:40 when we came through a hay field and stopped to decide where we should go next. I was looking across the field scanning the tree line that runs along the edge of the river. At the far southwest end of the field I notice a figure getting up out of a blackberry patch. It was huge and dark. I couldnt tell how tall it was but I could tell it was massive. Big shoulders long arms and wide body all covered in brown hair. The hair on it head looked like it went to its shoulders. It stood up and walk from the center of the patch to the trail in front of it. I brought it to the attention of the others with me as it crossed the trail and stood next to a fir tree it looked back at us. It turned and walked south into the next hay field and towards the southwest corner. We ran to were we saw it. We found nothing.

"On 4-24-03, my friend was driving home from work from Naselle, WA to Puget Island, WA around 12:30 a.m. on Highway 4 (Wahkiakum County, WA).

He reported seeing a large set of shoulders but didn't see the head due to catching a glimpse of the animal as he was driving by.  It appeared the animal was walking down the slope.   He reports that a bear (even a large bear on it's hind legs) would not demonstrate the shoulder width that this animal did. He said there are elk there all the time when he drives home but due to the size of the shoulders and color of the hair it was not an elk.  The weather was good although the light conditions were low being that it was past midnight.  He didn't hear anything or get out of the car to check for footprints.

"My dad got drawn for a big bull elk permit in the Mill Creek Watershed. He harvested a bull on November 1, off of Green Peak. We were packing out meat on Tuesday, November 4 in the late afternoon. We were taking our time following the trail back to Lewis Peak. There was about an hour of light left. We stopped at a rock outcropping to take a breather when I saw motion out of the corner of my eye. I told my dad that there was something coming across the openning we had just previously crossed. I was not sure what it was, as it had moved behind a tree. As it continued across the ridge, I noted that the animal was walking on two legs. The distance from where we were to the animal was approximately 500 yards. It was very clearly a bi-ped. We are very experienced hunters (20+ years for me, 40+ years for dad), with a lot of time in the field. We have harvested many, many deer, elk, and bear. This animal walked upright, and very quickly covered the distance across the openning, which was over a steep, loose-shale part of the trail. The trail was covered with packed snow from foot and horse traffic, and was fairly slippery in the cold weather. We had just crossed it, and had to take our time with the backpacks to make sure we did not slip. The animal crossed this openning very quickly, with no apparent difficulty whatsoever. It appeared to be approximately 7-8 feet tall and very dark from head to toe. It did look our direction, but did not stop to observe us. After a quick debate about what the heck we had just seen, noting that we were not carrying firearms at the time, it was heading in our direction, and that we had two loads of elk parts on our packs, we quickly left the area. I watched the trail as my dad tied the packs to the 4-wheeler, but did not see anything come down the trail.","Walla Walla Mill Creek Watershed. On the intake trail between Green Peak and Lewis Peak.

"Hi there, i don`t know if this is of any intrest or help to you but i just wanted to tell it anyway. I´m a 23 year old german/american who just came back visiting my uncle in Spokane, WA. I live in Stuttgart, Germany. On August 2nd i visited my cousin who lives in Bellingham, WA. My partner on this trip was my uncles American-Staffordshire ""Kane"". We had a nice weekend in Bellingham and so on. We drove back on August 4th at about 7-7:30PM. We took Interstate 5 and then Highway 20 cause i wanted to drive through Skagit Valley and the N.Cascade NP. At about 9PM i had to loosen my water(hopefully u know what i mean). We were just about by a River of which i don`t exactly know the name. I pulled over to the side and what happened then has changed my thinking of the world a lot. I got out of the car looking for relief and all of a sudden ""Kane"" started growling like i never heard him before(the window on his side was rolled down a little). It was almost dark so i looked over around but couldn`t see anything, so i thought maybe a deer or something. I went on with my buisness and then ""Kane"" totally flipped out(Barking and everything), so i looked around and saw something real big jumping over the streets with like 2 steps and then vanishing in the woods(It was about 30yards away). Since i`m a courageus youngster from a relative big city(Stuttgart has about 700000) i decided to check it out. So i got ""Kane"" on the leash and we walked to that position and after about 20yards the dog stopped, pressing out all his muscle and started growling. I tried to pull him with me but he wouldn`t move a inch. I had a little flashlight with and pointed towards the woods but couldn`t see anything. Then i realized this awful smell(smelled like ferrets but much more intense). The dog then started backing up and i thought it was time to get outta here! We were back at the car when all of a sudden the bushes and trees behind us started cracking and bursting towards us. We got in the car and hit the gas.

"This was a long time ago. In the summer of 1972. My cousin and I were spending a weekend fishing on the South Fork of the Nooksack River. The exact location was at the end of the Strand Road off of Highway 9 between Sedro Wooley and the Mt Baker Highway. We were both going into the 8th grade. Our parents dropped us off on a Friday and would pick us up Sunday. Crazy werent they! We set up camp fairly close to the end of the road, about 50 feet from the river. We spent Friday afternoon fishing and came back to our camp and built a fire. Finally we went to bed. We both stuck our pocket knives in the sand next to us in case we needed them at night. I was startled awake in the middle of the night by a sound and as I awoke sleeping in my sleeping bag saw the silhouette of something on the other side of a small fence, and slightly above us. It was about 20 feet away. There was a full moon behind which created a perfect silhouette image. This creature made a series of long hissing type sounds. The best discription is a hissssssssssss. Then it would stop for a bit and do it again. It did this 5-6 times. The silhouette was from about the waist up, it was broad shouldared with no neck. It had a sloping forehead and not noticable ears that I could detect. It rocked slightly from side to side as if it was smelling us or trying to see us laying there a bit better. It could not have gotten right us without going through this fence and under some small branches. It appeared that it was likely crouching down maybe on one knee. I was obviously petrified. It was there for probaly 3-5 minutes. When it left it kind of pivoted its entire body to its right and was gone. I would estimate this to be about 3 in the morning. I heard nothing as it walked away. I layed there for the rest of the night frozen stiff with fright, to the point that my body began cramping up! I did not hear anything as it left, nor smelled anything. I did hear shortly after it left, from the direction of the river and sounding like across the river a series of clicks with what sounded like rocks being hit togethor very rapidly. They were hit togethor 3-5 times very fast. I heard this a few times firt fairly close, then farther off as if going away from us. My cousin did not hear a thing.. sleeping away. We stayed there the following night without incident. although with a big fire going and fishing line tied to each others wrist, should we need to wake each other! In the morning I told my cousin and we looked for tracks, but did not see anything. The field that this thing was on was hard packed and it was very hard and dry, so no indentations. I know what I saw! It was not a man nor a bear, nor someone trying to scare us making a growling sound or something.. None of that! It makes the hair stand on my neck as I recount this incident even though it has been nearly 30 years ago!","Heading South on Highway 9 from the intersection of Highway 9 and the Mt Baker Highway, past Van Zandt about 5 miles to the Strand Road.

Two more girls arrived and set up their tents. The entire area was on a fire ban so we had to cook our dinner using the propane stove.  We had a few drinks, but nothing substantial and we stayed up talking until about 11:00pm.  We secured the site for animals and we each climbed into our tents to get a good night sleep as we were hiking Hannigan Pass the next morning. Around the 2:00am - 3:00am point (not sure) I could hear something in the site.  We are all seasoned hikers and have become accustomed to hearing 'critters' in the campsite.  I know for a fact that the other girls usually wore earplugs so these sounds didn't drive them crazy.  I was lying awake (a little bout of insomnia) and just assumed it was a racoon or something.  Although, in my mind sounded a little bigger than a racoon. I kept quiet and tried not to move while my heart was beating rather fast.  The sound came closer to my tent and then something brushed up against my tent (enough to crinkle the tarp I was using as a fly).  My tent was a 5 foot high dome tent and whatever it was crinkled the tarp near the top.  The sound went away shortly after that.  As a researcher, I should have stuck my head out of the tent to see what it was, but that is the closest I have ever come to an actual sighting and it was a little too close for comfort.  To make a long story short... I was scared out of my wits. The next morning, the girls were up and making coffee.  They were preparing for their hike.  I made a conscious decision not to tell them about the encounter as most of them are skeptical about this animal.  I made an excuse not to go on the hike. I had a badly cracked callus on my heel so it wasn't difficult to beg out. Just before the girls left, one of the girls (Allyson) came over to me and asked if I had heard anything strange during the night. I told her what I heard and she told me that something had 'walked' around her truck and gave it a nudge.  Allyson sleeps in her truck bed (which has a canopy).  She said she looked out the window and saw a shadow... then it was gone.  I asked her to keep this to herself and the girls left on their hike. I began to 'audit' the campsite for tracks or other evidence.  Since the girls were up and around before me, I had no idea if there would be anything visible or not.  I started with my tent.  My tent was pitched between two old growth trees with approximately 4 feet of space on either side.  On the left side of the tent (facing the door) between the tree and the tent were 2 footprints - one print was sunk at least an inch into the pine mulch.  The other print was more to the rear of the tent, but not castable.  I tool my tool and boxed both prints.  I stood beside the good print and attempted to make a footprint in the pine mulch to see if I could get it an inch deep.  I wasn't even close.  I barely disturbed the mulch enough to get an outline.  I went in the direction the prints were sort of headed and about 5 feet off the deer trail I found one more track.  Half the track was in a little puddle of dried mud and the other half was in the mulch.  Unfortunately, the mud side wasn't enough to cast.  I boxed that track and moved on to the other tents.  There was nothing visible around the other tents so I moved on to the vehicles.  I discovered 5 tracks around Allyson's truck.  Her truck was parked more on the hard dirt so only the outlines were visible, but they were not deep enough to cast.  Two of the tracks had sandal prints over top of them.  I am assuming they belong to Allyson.  After I boxed the prints, I checked for any prints or hair on the sides of the vehicle.  There was a smudge in the dirt on the passenger side door, but nothing I could consider as tangible evidence.  I walked over to the Explorer and found another 4 tracks.  Some of the tracks had been tromped on by the girls getting their packs out and such, but there was nothing castable.  I boxed them and and continued to look around the campsite to no avail.  It didn't surprise me that there was nothing around the firepit or perimeter as the girls were up a good hour before I was so they probably destroyed anything that might have been there.  I got out my kit and cast the one good track beside my tent.  It measured 12 1/4"" in Length and 7 1/4' in width (width was measured between the two points of the 'ball') and 7/8' deep.  My guess is that it was an adolescent as it was not as big as I have seen in the past.  It was definitely larger than any man's foot I have ever seen. As I waited for the cast to dry, I thought I would make myself a cup of coffee and read my book for awhile.  I was sitting in my camp chair and I heard some 'clicking' sounds about 100 feet back into the forest.  It almost sounded like two rocks being hit together, or perhaps the sound of someone pounding in a tent peg.  I went back reading and almost a half an hour later, the clicking was still going on.  I decided to venture back into the woods (with bear spray in hand) to see where it was coming from.  As soon as I reached the beginning of the deer trail, it stopped.  I know it sounds like a cliché, but I really understand now what people are saying when they feel like they are being watched.  The hairs on my arms and neck were standing on end and it was about this time I was really wishing I had not stayed behind.  I went back over to my chair and sat down. I thought if I put the radio on, it would get my mind off of this stuff for awhile.  I checked the cast and it was still tacky. Although my research tells me that these animals try to avoid humans as much as possible (as do bears), I was really starting to get scared. I got my book and I sat in my car for awhile and blasted the heat. Once in a while, I would get out of the car and check the cast. The clicking was still there. The atmosphere was really erie. It was a little overcast it seemed as if the temperature dropped 5 or 10 degrees. Finally I said to myself ""you've been waiting ten years for this - stop being a baby"" and I got out of the car. By this time the cast was dry and I lifted it up. Because this was cast in pine mulch, I had to get as much of the mulch off as possible. When doing that, I noticed some black hairs embedded in the cast around the ouside of the print.  The hairs are about an inch and a half in length. By this time the clicking had stopped but I still felt like someone was watching me. I made the decision to put the cast in my trunk and not mention any of this to girls as I did not want to scare them (and I didn't want to be subjected to the ridicule of non-believers). I saved the one print that I had cast, but I went around and destroyed all the other prints. I decided to make myself something to eat and wait for the girls to return. When the girls got back, I walked towards them and they said ""You look like you've seen a ghost"". I told them that it was really eerie here by myself and that I was glad they were back. The girls went into their tents to change into their bathing suits so they could go down to the river to wash. Allyson came over to me and asked me what happened. I told her everything, but asked her not to say anything to the other girls. Allyson mentioned that her friends live in Maple Falls and they have problems with sasquatch all the time. They hear screams, their gardens are raided and there are commotions at night.  She said that her friends have dealt with them for years and it has just become a part of life. I eventually told the girls and they were a little scared/excited going to sleep that evening. I explained that whatever it was, was curious and probably wouldn't come back.  To my knowledge... it didn't.",Follow the Mt. Baker Highway East from Bellingham.  Go through Maple Falls and drive for 37 miles.  Turn left into Snoqualmie Snow Park and follow gravel road.

"Was out camping with a bunch of friends at a campground at Baker Lake near the dam. I was in a small tent in the middle of the campground with lots of camper travel trailers surrounding me. For some reason I woke up in the middle of the night and layed there trying to get back to sleep. I started hearing distant yelping sounds like the Snohomish sounds I've heard before. I also heard a lot of the camper's dogs barking. So I listened to both for a while to distinguish one from the other and make sure I wasn't just hearing the dogs. I could tell they were two distinctive sounds and not related. I listened for quite a while (hour or so) because it was so interesting. The sounds were forceful but didn't sound like they were terribly close so I wasn't scared of the tent shaking and getting a visitor. The yelping would stop then I would hear loud vocalizations like a couple of them were speaking to each other. Can't remember those sounds exactly, but thought it was very cool to be hearing these noises. Wish I had my PDA fired up at that time. Did hear some rocks being thrown around in the woods too. Didn't think it was any of the other campers because they were pretty much all drunk and sleeping by that time.

when i was a kid we lived out side of yakima out in the country by parker a little town out side of yakima . Near the yakima river matter of fact we were so close to the river that in the spring when the river rose we had to move the animals an go into town .the woods were thick we had a pig pen it was a long ways away from the house really thickly wooded. all the time we lived there you wood hear shrill whistling whistling in the bushes at this time we were maybe ten years old never heard of bigfoot before im 48 years old now so it was long ago.It was in the ninteen sixtys way before roger patterson nobody knew about bigfoot . Well anyway us kids were sent into the woods to feed the cows at the big pond . We had two cows we had a little wagon with a bail of hay on it .We left it there for them to eat we left and stopped by the river to talk. Four of us kids we were all looking the same way when all of a sudden 30 feet away something something stepped from the clearing in full view of us took one step maybe six feet an dissapeared behind a bush it was id say eight feet tall hairy it took one step and was gone .We alllooked at each other an ran home nobody beleived us the said it may have been a hunter or something . that was the end of it . It was years later that i learned what it really was .I was 40 years old looking in a library when i saw something about it and what i read told of sightings of bigfoot in the same place where we lived the same years we lived there. It didnt try to chase us we were kids it could have caught us easily but i think it was just watching us . I also reamember my aunt going to kook for us kids at anoughter time at the pig pen we came home anighter way she came running up out of breath she heard a loud whistle behind her in the bushes i remmber hearing those all the time even in the daytime they were so shrill. Once my aunt was alone at the house at night she came out side to get into the car to pick us up in town she herd the shrill whistle behind her next to the house she tore out out of there so fast she drove right therw the loced fence. all of this is true he does exist i saw him .

I was traveling west on road 1502 (which is graveled) looking for a campsite for bow season. I glanced in my rearview mirror and saw a very large upright creature step to the middle of the road. I immediatly slowed down and quickly glanced around for a safe spot to pull over and there wasn't one I looked back over my shoulder through my canopy window and saw that the creature was still standing in the middle of the road. There was still a lot of dust in the air from where I had passed and all I could make out was that What I was looking at was very tall maybe (7 to 8 feet) and broad it also was very dark in color. The arms appeared to be held out slightly from the sides and reached to about mid thigh. when I reached a full stop the creature seemed to pivot on its left leg while swinging its arms turned to the left and took one step to the opposite side of the road and disapeared from view. When I looked at the area where it crossed I was unable to discern any tracks in the gravel that I could definately say were footprints. The area where the creature went off the road is very steep and rocky. I would not want to try going down it without ropes and I doubt if what I saw was another hunter out scouting since the hill ends in a cliff just a few hundred yards down.,From hwy 410 turn off at the wood shed go back to road 1500 follow it till you see a sign saying McDaniel lake thiis will be road 1502 once you cross the Rattlesnake river bridge you will go about a half of a mile and you will make a hairpin turn you will travel uphill for about 3/10 more of a mile and make a curve to the right you will come out into the open and the hillside will start to fall off to your left this is where I saw the creature.

"First off I am not a true beliver in BigFoot.  I was messing around on the internet and stumbled apon your site.  I thought it would be funny to see what sightings have happend around my home city of Yakima Washington.  When I clicked on the report form of the July 2000 (class B) hearing sound around bumping lake, I got the chills.  Let me start from the begining.  Myself and a couple of buddies of mine took off from Yakima really late with the intent of climbing the trail and spending 3 days of camping at Twin Sisters. We were going to stay at the first lake (Or First Sister).  The lake is about 8 or 9 miles past bumping lake and you have to hike in about 1-1.25 miles straight up. When we arrived at the lake after taking way to long to climb the trail (Over confident and over packed) we set up came and got the fire going by 12:30am-1:00am.  We were exhausted and really didn't feel like drinking or anything else but eating and going to bed.  About two hours after going to bed I was awoken by some little grunting sounds.  I woke up kind of starteld but then realized they were basically a quarter the way around the lake so I just sat and listened.  All of a sudden they turned from little gruntings to a grunt/scream.  I quietly called out my friends Shawns name and he had been woken up and was listening to.  I asked him what the hell that was and after talking about it we both convinced ourselves that it was an elk or something.  I am not an animal call expert by any means but to this day when I think about that trip one of the first things I think about is how weird that sounded.  I have heard elk and deer grunts before but this sounded different. As Ron White would say ""I told you that story so I could tell you this one."" On the last night I slow cooked some stakes over the fire coals for about.  When they were done my friends and I were enjoying them when were heard something about 60 or 70 yards out from camp.  We were camped out below the rocky base of the mountain top.  Its like the dirt stops and the rocks go up the rest of the way.  The sound was coming from the rocky area but we all thought it was a cat or bear so we got up grabbed the guns and an axe and started out with a lantern to go see what the hell was out there.  The sound was like what a rock being thrown and hitting the other rocks and then coming to rest.  It didn't sound like a little rock slide and it happen several times until we got closer, infact we had barehanded our stakes and finished them while we were away from camp as close to the sounds as we could get without climbing the rocky face, they completely stopped.  At no time did we every think it was bigfoot but we couldn't figure out what would make a sound like that?  It didn't sound like an animal that was mearly passing by, it moved to quick and to speratic(as if someone was throwing at different targets.  The only reason I look back on it now is that I was watching a bigfoot special today on the history channel and they had a gentlemen on there saying bigfoot was throwing rocks at him.  And now looking back I could definatley see how someone or something throwing a rock down twords us could make that sound.  Were the activity was would be the exact place I would be if I wanted to mess with my buddies back at camp.  We always talk about those noises and never ever gave bigfoot a chance of being the sorce of the sounds and now I just don't know.  After all this time of not even considering it now that I think of that as a possiblity it makes more and more sence even though I don't truely believe in Bigfoot.","Go past bumping road and head up the dirt trail, anytime the road forks go right.

"It happened close to midnight on August 18, 2007, on the last official night of a private expedition, east of Mt. Rainier in the Wenatchee National Forest, of Washington State. Out of respect for our WA-BFRO crew's primary Central Washington State research area, I've purposely withheld the exact location and am using ""Chinook Pass,"" which covers a broad general area. The event was both a weekend social gathering as well as a field expedition with one main base camp and several satellite camps over a 10-mile area. The area (which I initially felt was very dry aside from several marshy areas nearby, contained a tremendous amount of elk sign) has been used for a previous BFRO expedition as well as other private outings. It's been a consistent “hot zone” for our WA crew, who, lacking sophisticated heat-sensing equipment, have experienced a lot of curious activity over the years including purported vocalizations, wood-knocking, powerful footfalls, branch breaking, persons being paralleled, etc. and several documented sightings nearby within the BFRO database. In attendance were various members of both WABFR (Washington Bigfoot Field Research Group) & a majority of WA-BFRO researchers. A few of us CA-BFRO members were invited and held the furthest base camp from the main camp & shared that particular site with various WA bigfooters. A matter of fact, on any given night our camp held about 14-15 people with many walking back and forth only on the primary dirt road to the closest adjacent camp about one mile away. During the first two nights, there was no activity to report from my perspective other then some of the best barred owl vocalizations I've ever heard in my years in the field. For most of that Saturday, August 18th, I spent the day in Seattle with my friend Jamie J, picking up his son and we returned to the camp location around 5:30 PM. At around 11:00 PM our site held about 13-14 people (most of them researchers) who were consolidated in one small area. Everyone was congregated into this section of the camp that was bordered by vegetation on the backside in which there was a berm and trail running parallel right behind that vegetative border. Being a little antsy and not much in a socializing mood, I took a walk down that back pathway about 100 yds, (which was pitch black on a dark night with plenty of tree cover) to relieve myself. 30-40 yards further down that pathway the trail led to a swampy marsh & was broken up by denser vegetation & ponderosa pine (see map picture for camp layout). In the middle of urinating I was facing towards camp and heard a very close step-branch break at my eight-a-clock, 6-7 yds from me that did not give me the immediate impression a large subject was responsible. Casually walking back to camp and not hearing anything further, I asked one of my best friends & research partner, former BFRO researcher Cliff B., if I could borrow his X200xp handheld thermal imaging unit to scout around camp & see if I could see the subject responsible for the branch break on the pathway I'd just returned from. He immediately obliged and we walked to his truck, which was located about 30 yds behind the current congregated area in the opposite direction of that same pathway. When I received it, I immediately walked to the front of that pathway near where our tent was placed perpendicular to the trail and my companions congregation area was to my left about 20 yds in front of me down a small berm. As I could hear Cliff reshuffling equipment around the back of his truck, I put the imager to my eye to tune it and while doing so caught a glimpse of a small wood rat running 10 yds in front of me to the right. Straight ahead, I caught the heat signature of what I initially thought was a person standing behind a tree, beyond my party where it was pitch black. My initial impression did not change for about 20 seconds with the combination of only seeing about 10-15% of the subject. (partial legs, arms, knee & head were contrasted behind that biggest tree in view: see re-creation pic # 2) The subject then began to move its head right to left behind the tree repeatedly as if to possibly discern me or my presence more clearly. It then stepped out in plain view and dropped to ""all fours"" positioning, (see re-creation pic #3) looking over its left shoulder rotating its head in my direction as if to ""lock-in"" with arms fully extended and knees down. The second when it stepped out before dropping, the realization of what the subject was hit me and my reaction was a ""surreal"" shock considering the unexpected circumstances. When on the ground, the subject transitioned very rapidly to where it appeared it was now full body down favoring its right shoulder, rapidly moving and appeared to actually be inching up away from the tree it was initially behind & into a bit of a clearing from my perspective view. Knowing that the thermal unit I had was not self-recordable like a camcorder (at that time, to record video, our set-up was a back-pack attached to your front side containing a mini-DVR, connecting battery with plug-ins and helmet mount for the imager) I began snapping my fingers whispering loud ""Cliff,"" ""Cliff"" as I could hear Cliff repacking his truck about 30-35 yards behind me at a seven-a-clock position- back left. As I did that, the subject, who was grounded, still leaning off the right shoulder, began an almost unnerved & panicked, full-body convulsive movement obviously reactionary to the sound of my snapping fingers and voice (see re-creation pic #5). Oddly enough, it would pause-freeze in between those intervals and I was blown away that it appeared to react to my minimal sound, while my party (almost halfway between our line of site) was making a considerable amount of noise with conversing & acoustic guitar-playing. Cliff never responded in my cautious 5-6 attempts to get his attention and the subject further transitioned on the ground into what appeared to be a ""breaststroke"" uniformed-like motion (see re-creation pics #6 & #7). ""It"" was on its knees, head straight, facing toward a nine-o-clock position from my point of view, slightly down, back straight with clear space in between front torso and ground and violently swinging back what appeared to be both arms in a stroke-like motion. The hand positioning from my view (looking at the left arm) appeared to be positioned as if having four fingers held tight together and a thumb spaced away or extended, but I'm not absolutely certain. I could clearly see the subject repeat this movement 3-4 times and it appeared as if the large upper-body was being held up by the subject's abdominal muscles by the positioning and vertical space between the upper torso and ground. From this position, the subject got back down completely on the ground on its right shoulder and held an open hand above its face (facing me) as if ""blocking the sun from its eyes."" (see re-creation pics #8 & #9) I could even make out pretty clearly, five spread digits on the left hand up by its face. From this positioning the very agile subject appeared to ""pop-up"" from the ground clearly using no arms and quickly backed behind the initial tree I first witnessed it from. Again it looked at me right to left with its alternating head on both sides of the tree before dropping right back to the ground behind that same tree. It immediately came back up with what appeared to be the benefit of one arm which I believe was its right (am not certain because of how quickly it got up). Within seconds, it had quickly moved a few feet further back in the clear with its back clearly to me and what looked like the left leg slightly forward (see re-creation pics #10 & #11) and remained completely motionless for the next 40-45 seconds or so. Now I could clearly see the full profile of the subject (estimate about 90%) from about just below the calves up. Remarkably, I do not recall actually seeing its feet from my vantage point during the entire encounter. I can remember just repeating to myself under my breath, over and over, ""Oh my god, oh my god, I can't believe it's really happening, right now."" Its appearance (even with a white thermal profile) was absolutely remarkable & distinct with uneven weight distribution. The subject appeared to clearly possess about 2/3rds of its body weight in the upper extremities. It was obvious that the subject was predominantly bipedal by its build, though its movements on the ground just prior appeared agile, fluid and effortless. The subject's legs were fairly long but not particularly bulky in relationship to the massive torso above the waist as the bulk appeared from the waist up into just these massive shoulders & traps with no visible neck and what appeared to be from behind-- a smallish-rounder head (no discernable sagittal crest). The arm length was astonishing in that they looked ""exaggerated"" and appeared to hang as low as the subjects knees and possibly even further. A matter of fact, my guess would have its fingertips if completely extended (large hands seemed almost fisted) reach mid-to top calves. That impression was slightly thrown off a bit by the discovery the next day in daylight where it appeared the left foot had stepped over a small foot deep berm (while subject's back to me) just beyond the 10-15 yard window the subject stayed in during the whole encounter. The physical impression beyond that small berm, visually appeared to match the distance the subject was from me the night before and was also in wet thick pine-needle duff after raining all night. After about 40-45 seconds of just staring at this basically, glowing live ""statue,"" I had an extremely difficult decision to make--either continue watching the subject until it departs or attempt to document it by taking the imager from my eye, run back and notify Cliff to set-up for recording capability while praying the subject wouldn't leave in the process. I chose the latter, and it was one of the most difficult but unregrettable things I've done in my life. The last image I have of this subject was seeing it in that ""departing"" position (never saw it leave or even move again, just stood there glowing through the imager). I immediately ran towards Cliff, who was still at the back of his truck and was just screaming at him words I don't recall but must have been obvious as he moved very quickly in what I needed him to do. To my chagrin, looking back from where I came, the guitar playing had stopped and I could here a variety of scattering voices from my party and movement, including two people with headlamps on totally oblivious to what was happening, while walking up the small berm and into the line of sight between where I stood opposed to the subject during the encounter. In a panic, and without much of an explanation other then ""I just saw one, get back,"" I attempted to pull everybody back into the congregation area and continue with what they were doing minutes earlier. I had to physically pull some people back who began curiously looking down that pathway behind the congregation area. I knew Cliff was moving quickly and within minutes, saw him fully geared, running quickly back down the path towards where I last witnessed the subject standing. For the few minutes he was back there, my heart was racing from adrenalin & I was still cautiously optimistic Cliff would maybe catch the subject loitering or even departing. Unfortunately, after about 5 minutes he came back & looked at me shaking his head. About an hour later, close to 1:00 AM, Paul G. (WA-BFRO), walked back to the spot so we could interpret actual distance of the subject from my positioning during the encounter. As I saw him walk back to the initial tree it was behind, I yelled, ""stop,"" and he estimated the distance using his own steps at about 150 ft (50 yds). (After returning to this exact area the weekend of September 17-20th 2009, through exact measurement we determined that I first witnessed the subject at around 50 yds with a slight right to left angle, but worked my way up to only 33 yds from the subject with a line of sight from right to left-opposite ends of pathway). Seeing him stand there made my jaw drop as I know Paul is 6'3 & 170lbs, and it was a shock to see him ""fully clothed"" & realize the size discrepancy between both he and the subject. I'd estimate the subject at 4-7 inches taller, but even conservatively estimating its size in comparison, it was about 3 times the total body mass of Paul G. Even with the depth perception issue of this particular proprietary unit I was experienced with, I knew the subject was big once it was in the clear with its back to me, but was shocked how much thicker and oddly proportioned it was compared to Paul. I've always been great estimating people's height and poor estimating people's weight, but by comparing Paul within one hour after and the encounter so fresh in my mind, I'd estimate the subject I saw as being close to 7 ft (maybe 6'9 or 6'8) and between 475, to as much as 575 lbs. As I said earlier, the next day in daylight, what looked like a foot impression dug into heavy, wet duff was first noticed by Jamie J. and looked to be about where the subject had its back to me and left leg slightly forward. Except for the placement, it was unimpressive. Although there was heavy overnight rain, Jamie also found where the ground had been disturbed in several places where the subject had been transitioning on the ground. All of this surface was non-conducive substrate for any kind of attempted casting however and made up of wet, rain-soaked, pine needles. (to see the type of ground cover & me reenacting the subject's movements see second to last picture) It should also be mentioned that 10-15 minutes after the encounter, a female WA-BFRO member thought she was paralleled while walking away from our camp with her boyfriend on the primary vehicle road. Another CA member later heard heavy footfalls several hours later about 30 yds from where I witnessed the subject, and in the early morning hours of about 3:30-4 AM, in a heavy rain, two of us in separate tents heard large (powerful) bipedal footfalls outside our tents (confirmed next day) followed by what sounded like guttural ""doe-like"" grunts. Outside of my tent was a stationed 250D Raytheon thermal imager facing down the pathway of the encounter, but the subject never came close to breaching that pathway (was well behind opposite side of tent) & would've made little difference if it had as the battery life for that unit does not exceed 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Six of us also stayed in the camp one more night (August 19, 2009) and the night was uneventful around camp. But undetermined vocalizations (possibly barred owl) came from the ridge behind us (several miles away) well into the morning. ""RE-CREATION"" picture links in sequence below: (Note)--All ""Re-Creations"" were done taking a digital color picture of the immediate sighting location & the roughly 15-yard window the subject remained in the whole encounter, making it black & white to give a generic ""thermal effect."" The subject was colored in using whiteout and should not be gaged by recurring size in each individual re-creation as my artwork has limitations. The idea was to give the reader/viewer a general impressionist view focusing on the various subject positioning I recall & a general idea of how the subject visually appeared to me. All re-creations were completed by me within two to three weeks after the encounter (late August to early September 2007)          Link to Canadian artist Brian Cundle's poster rendition of the sighting event: http://northamericanbigfoot.blogspot.com/2010/09/brian-cundle.html ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- More details, potential insight & subjective interpretations from my perspective regarding the subject during the encounter. --At no time did I hear or see the subject vocalizing in any manner ---From the time I first saw the subject behind the tree until I took that imager off my eye while it was in a ""frozen"" but ""departing"" position, the subject remained within about a 10-15-yard window during the whole estimated two-plus minutes of the encounter. --Although it's probable based on time and location, I'm not 100% certain that the ""step, branch break,"" down the trail 5-10 minutes before the encounter can be attributed to the subject I actually witnessed. --I'm certain that without using the thermal imager out of curiosity and boredom, myself nor anyone else in my party would've ever known one of these animals was there. Considering the circumference of the actual camp and where I witnessed the subject, it was strategically positioned far enough back to having no chance of being noticed on a quarter moon night under heavy tree cover. (see camp layout map) --With the unnerved reaction by the subject to my loud whispers and finger-snapping with noisy companions between our line of sight, I believe I saw obvious visual evidence of acute & possibly directional hearing ability of the subject. Furthermore, I believe and it's just my opinion, that the subject never could clearly see me (by never seeming to lock-in visually) but knew my exact presence at all times, maybe either through sound or my likely subconscious, nervous footsteps trying to position myself for better views. -- For as much as I could see, I'm certain I missed a lot when the subject was ""grounded."" Some of the transitioning was so rapid that it was indiscernible during brief intervals in the encounter & can't properly be described. Much of what couldn't be made out in the rapid transitional movements (like when the subject appeared unnerved) was in-between the subject's distinct positioning I clearly recall. Furthermore, during some other brief intervals, partial ground vegetation blockage was also a factor. --At no time was the encounter a scary experience. If anything, it was very intensely ""surreal"" watching ""one"" through an imager as I have so many other humans & Pacific Northwest animals. Part of the absent fear likely also stemmed from the clear visual distance contrast from the subject and myself and being psychologically comforted that so many of my companions were nearby. --Although you can't interpret actual hair from 30-50 yards with this thermal unit, there did seem to be some hair shade (as have some other large mammals I've seen from a similar distance on certain nights) and the subject was undoubtedly void of any clothing. From 50 yds that night while doing the comparison and measuring the subject's distance from me, Paul G's clothing could be easily discerned through the unit as he wore a winter wardrobe with a checkered flannel, vest and beanie. (Note Paul G was measured and compared from roughly 50 yards when he stood at subject's initial positioning and his clothing was easily discernible, the majority of where I watched the subject was about 33 yards). --I saw nothing indicating the subject witnessed was a female (not extremely wide hips, no discernible breasts etc…) and based on size/behavior, it's my opinion the subject was likely a young adult male. ---Based on the agile, effortless movements of the subject both on the ground and standing up behind the tree in the beginning of the encounter, coupled with its profile appearance, I fully believe I saw a more ""ape-like animal"" being then my preconceived notion of what a sasquatch might appear like or actually be. --One month after the sighting, a local friend informed me that a boy scout master he knew personally & his troop had had a late afternoon sighting around 4:00 PM on August 19th (the day after my encounter) about 3-5 miles as the crow flies up-country from our camp location near a small lake. Coincidentally, our camp experienced nothing unusual our last night (August 19th). Several months later, the same friend also stated that he'd driven by our camp location and saw several hunters butchering and skinning elk right in broad daylight. Not uncommon during hunting season in that location I've been told. --The area continues to be a hot area as one of our WA-BFRO researchers had an almost identical but more brief & distant thermal sighting with the same X200xp unit, 1/4 of a mile from this location about 10 months later. On that expedition, several people reported much of the stealth & dexterous behavior I'd witnessed the previous August and emailed or called to inform me upon returning home.",Withheld,Yakima County,Washington,Summer,Report 26065: California BFRO researcher has sighting with a thermal imaging unit in Wenatchee National Forest,46.85,-121.25,8/18/2007,26065,Class A,c23f8bu3n0,52.71,45.46,38.21,40.86,0.87,0.62,0.19,0.0015,0.77,rain,1012.78,Light rain overnight.,8,5.93,263,2.19

"[Investigators's interview notes begin here. The witness did not write up the story himself.] On November 9th, 2006,  the local media in southeastern Wisconsin ran a story about a possible sighting near Holy Hill. The story refered to the contracted worker whose job it is to pick up deer carcasses on the highway on a regular basis.  Some  versions of the news story said a deer carcass was stolen from his truck by an alleged bigfoot. The story ran in many newspapers across the country and quickly got the attention of various bigfoot researchers. Local TV also started reporting on the story. Local TV also reported on the story and used it as a good humor story for their broadcasts. Due to the topic awareness created by the local news story, other people in the area began talking about observations and experiences they had with a similar looking figure. I first sought out the contracted worker. He was frustrated because the media seemed to put words in his mouth about the incident. He didn't know what the animal was, and he did not say that it was a bigfoot. He merely described what happened, and what he observed. He emphatically stated he did not call it a bigfoot. The state trooper's report conveys what happened, and what Steve observed. It does not call it a bigfoot either, but some elements of the story seemed consistent with sasquatch behavior, especially the  Because of the deer element, the BFRO wanted to get a detailed, first-hand account of what Steve K. observed and experienced. I met with him a week later (11/17). We spoke for 45 minutes. He came across as a patient, rational person. I started off by measuring the distance from the front seat of the extended cab Dodge pickup to the end of the pickup with the tail-gate down, it was 13.5 feet. He showed me the lights he had on at the time: head lights, interior dome light, factory bed light, and he had an 18’’ amber beckon light flashing on top of the cab. The beckon light is positioned on the cab like a police car’s official lights where, there’s one flashing light on each end. I got into the diver’s seat of the pickup, looked in the center mirror like Steve K.  had done, AND had him stand were he saw the creature. He stood in the middle of the pickup just behind the open tail gate. I could see all of his head, and on the bottom, halfway between his shoulders and his elbows. Steve K. stands 6 feet tall and weighs about 230 lb. The lighting was sparse, but I could see his facial features. If it was an all black form like what Steve says, I can’t imagine being able to see a lot of detail. Next we spoke about the sequence of events. Steve K. was driving west-bound along Holy Hill Rd., on 11/9/06 at 1:30am, and 15 yards west of the intersection of Troll Hill Road he found a dead deer. The deer wasn’t on his list of dead deer to pick up. He had just happened upon it and he figured he’d pick it up because he knew he would have to pick it up later. Steve K.  receives a list of dead deer locations faxed to him each morning. He lifted up the 80 – 100 lb dead doe himself, put it in the back of the pickup with the four other dead deer. He didn’t notice anything unusual about the dead deer and there weren’t any strange sounds around him. He got into the pickup, closed the door, reached for his clip board.  He didn’t have a chance to open the clipboard because that’s when he first felt the pickup shudder. He thought it was the wind. Almost instantaneously, it shuddered again. He instinctively looked up at the center mirror and saw a dark figure reaching into the bed of the pickup. He said it was all black, had a head that was a cross between a black bear and a wolf. Its ears were pointed straight up, not folded over. He knew it wasn’t a bear. He could see something like a muzzle, but he couldn’t see its eyes. He said it reached out with one “arm”. He could not see ""whether it had claws or fingers or hands”. It had three-foot wide shoulders and described it as being “stocky”. He said it was about has tall as I am (5’10’’) when it was reaching into the bed. I stood behind the pickup so he could gauge the height of what he had seen. He watched it at the most five seconds where the first couple of seconds he was trying to figure out what it was. The next few seconds fear was setting in. “It scared the crap out of me”. Steve K. quickly pulled away and didn’t bother to look in the mirror as he left. He heard the ramp hit the ground as he headed west. When he set the deer in the pickup ‘it must have gotten tangled with the ramp’. The deer that was taken was the one that he had just put in. He went back five (5) minutes later and there was no deer, and no ramp. The reason he went back was, because he needed the ramp along with the remaining ramp in the pickup to wench in heavy deer in to the bed of the pickup. Background Info: Steve goes out every other night to pick up road kill. He drives 450 miles a night and picks up from 9 to 18 deer. He’s been doing this for 18 months and nothing like this has ever happened to him before. On occasion he’ll pick up a deer and hear scavengers in the bushes. Steve said, occasionally there won’t be a carcass to pick up at an assign spot, and he attributes that to a program called “Earn-A-Buck”. Washington county participates in a program where a person can bring in a dead doe and get a buck tag for it. He says the DNR knows that people are probably bringing in road kill to get the buck tag. He also laughingly suggested that people could be taking the road kill to eat. The deer that he picked up on that night wasn’t more than 2 hours old, as rigamortis had not set in. He could not tell if it was still warm because he was using gloves. On occasion he’d pick up deer that have been scavenged on, and the entrails will be gone. He can tell if a deer’s peritoneum cavity (gut) has been opened by something chewing on it, or if it’s been ripped open. He couldn’t say what would open a deer by ripping it open. He said that he could tell if something had been cut opened because he’s a deer hunter and knows what it looks like, and he has never seen that on road kill. Bear rarely venture that far south in the state. On the morning that I interviewed him, he said earlier in the night, he was at the intersection of Hwy 83 and Q, and he was picking up a deer. Steve said that had this uneasy feeling that something was watching him. Hwy 83 & Q is 4.5 miles southwest (as the crow flies) from where the dead deer was removed from his pickup. Last, I asked Steve what was the likelihood it was someone in a costume. He said, ‘that was so far out there as someone telling him that what he saw was something from a different dimension’.",,Washington County,Wisconsin,Fall,Report 16564: Deer carcass nabbed from pickup truck in Erin (Hwy 167 at Station Way),43.251,-88.3245,11/9/2006,16564,Class B,dp9nn1s53f,60.22,48.095,35.97,38.71,0.63,0,0.65,0,0,,1005.85,Clear throughout the day.,2,9.59,301,4
"I am writing this report for a family member of mine. The witness to the bigfoot was driving in her vehicle on her way home from work. The route she takes is all country back roads. She was going up a hill with her brights on and notices something was hiding behind a tree on the left side of the road. So she slowed down and it looked around the tree right at her and then poked back into hiding.The witness stated that it was very tall over 6ft tall and had red eyes and a man like face. The witness remembers going through her head questioning what it could have been and soon realized it was something, she had never believed in a bigfoot. She couldn't get over small little details from the little she seen of it. The height, color of eyes, and the way the eyes were set on the face, so human like, unlike an animal, and the face it self more flat like a human not pointy like a deer or bear.

"I am  47 yrs old and have been hunting since a small boy. I have heard deer, elk, bear, cougar and all of the different noises they make. What I experienced recently while hunting was something I have Never in all my life seen or heard before. It shook me up very bad. I was always very skeptical of bigfoot but after this experience, I am convinced. On Oct. 17th 2002, I was hunting deer on Silver creek, approximately 32 miles up the Entiat River valley, at about 4500-4700 ft elevation. My plan was to hunt up the creek on steep, heavy timbered ground up toward a knob called Big Hill. I planned to hunt slowly. Go as far as I could until noon and head back down to my truck which was parked on an old non maintained forest service road about 5 miles from the Shady Pass Road ( which is a steep dirt rd. It also goes up to big hill and then over to lake chelan....a  34 mile trip). I left the truck and was in the timber before daylight (about 6:50 am). I was hunting uphill, going slow, and angling away from the creek. I was finding lots of deer sign and it looked like a promising day. I went about 100 yards before seeing a small buck bedded and jumping some does up. I walked on for 45 or more minutes. The deer sign quit except for a couple old tracks. I was standing quietly to plan my direction when I heard what sounded like logs or poles being thrown onto a pile of more poles. I heard this sound three different times in a row,  just a few minutes apart. There were no hunters or other people in this remote area. Walking further up the hill I saw a draw coming up. Looking around for my best entrance, I see a White Fir tree approx. 24 "" on base with an oval piece of bark missing. I figured it must have been done by bear or buck deer. I walked down to it to discover only one gouge on the bark above scar. It obviously wasn't done by a bear or deer. It appeared to be pulled off gently and exact. The top was eye level to me, and the bottom was about 10""-12"" above ground. there was only one small piece of bark on the ground about 4"" wide and 12"" long also shaped in a perfect oval. The sap on tree was untouched. I turned and walked to the edge of the draw. Looking down only 12 feet or so at the bottom, was what appeared to be a large deer bed. When I got down to it, it was an area the size of three dinner tables. It was covered in fir and pine needles and obviously well packed. Standing there I could hear water running. Looking down into a hole on the downhill edge of this, was a short under ground creek exposed. The hole was approx. 4 feet long, 12 in wide, and 20-24 inches deep, with a flow of water at the bottom. I glanced up the draw. It was steep and covered with nothing but fir needles and old rotten logs. The same below but not as steep. The next thing I noticed really got my attention. Water had recently been splashed up and over one side of the hole onto the dry fir needles. Feeling uneasy, I walked up and out of the other side of the draw on a well worn, well packed path covered in fir and pine needles. The area has a lot of little bushes which resemble a miniature huckleberry, the plant no taller than 6"" high. These on the edges of the path were also smashed down flat. There was no sign of bear tracks in area. At the upper crest of the path  I studied a track, human like but with no signs of toes. It was about the length of my boot (I wear a size 12). Where the ball of the human foot is straight across, this seemed to bump up in the middle but no sign of toes. (Meaning that the whole size of this foot had to have been much larger than that of any humans). The ground was hard and had some needles on it. Looking up ahead I saw Willow bushes in an opening in the timber. I was trying to decide whether to go up or below it when I noticed what seemed to be stacked dead logs inside of what appeared to be a circle of Willow bushes approx. 60 feet in diameter. Planning to walk closer to get a better look, I almost step on feces that I have never seen before. (I have been an avid hunter and hiker for many years and have NEVER seen the looks of this before). It was a weird textue and color and looked more human than bear or cougar. I decided to take a picture with my disposable camera I had in my backpack. As I was taking my pack off, I glanced downhill and caught a glimpse of what looked to be some brown fur quickly ducking down behind a buckskin log. I didnt get a good look so I thought it could have just been a squirrel since the area was full of them, but it was too large, and also, the last thing you see of a squirrel is its tail and not a patch of fur. I began to get very uncomfortable. I pulled out my camera from my pack and knelt down and took a picture of the feces. Wanting to be sure it worked, I decided I should take another one. I then got the idea that after I took the second picture, I would empty a ziploc bag I had in my pack containing my trail snacks and take a feces sample back with me to turn into someone for some further investigation on it. I knelt even closer to get my second picture, started to wind the camera and all of a sudden from behind me I hear a sound I cant even really describe. You had to be there to hear it yourself to get any sense of just how this thing sounded. It was a ""whuuuuuuuuu""  sound. A kind of a roar like, yell like sound. It was very low and lungy and louder in decibals than any human, even one shouting as loud as he could right in my ear. It had to have come from something with a very large set of lungs. It was a very threatening, warning type of sound accompanied by a large crash like that of a log being thrown through large bushes. Looking up and behind me, all I saw was two squirrels running panickedly down the hill through the draw and up a fir tree not more than 10 feet in front of me. I decided I was OUT OF THERE, shoving my camera in my pack. I looked up to the squirrels sitting on the lower branches. They were looking in the direction the noise came from and making a lot of racket. I think I may have even said outloud ""OK I'M LEAVING"" as I got my pack onto my back. Not thrilled about having to go back in the direction of the noise, I unsnapped my 44 mag. handgun in my holster. I was trying to leave lower toward the creek than I had come. As I passed by the draw I looked below to see the tree with the bark missing, so I headed even more down hill. I could faintly hear Silver creek below me maybe a 1/4 mile or so away. Inititally trying to be quiet, I felt it best to make all the noise I could. So I stepped on every dead limb and branch I could. Going around a tree, I almost stepped on some more feces. It was the same color, gray and tan with some white specs throughout, but this was much larger and more of a constipated texture. It had kind of a pink or champagne tint to it. I thought about stopping to retrieve a sample but I wasnt about to stop and kneel down again. For the first 200 yards or so, I could hear something purposefully making loud noise (Stuff crashing around and what sounded to be large things being tossed and thrown) it stayed just out of my sight below and behind me. Then as I neared the road, it all appeared to just stop and I felt I was left alone. As I finished my desent out ,and for the rest of the day, all I could think about was that sound. How loud and breathy it sounded. A person standing right behind me couldnt be even half that loud. It sounded like the exact same sound my son and daughter's boyfriend had described to me last November  while hunting In the late buck season. They had something answer the grunt tube call they were using not more than a mile from the same spot.","North on Hwy 97 Alt to the Entiat turn off, NW on this road for about 30 miles, past the small gas station, post office, cafe and church with the sign of Ardenvoir on it.

My brother In Law Dan, told me of his experience after I told him that I reported mine to BFRO! Dan's story goes like this: He had gone up to visit some people camping in a trailer. As he arrived and turned off his motorcycle engine, he observed something dark in color moving on an open hillside below a timber line. There was snow on the ground, it was getting towards dusk and it was a little foggy.The thing was two hundred and fifty yards away approximately. As Dan observed this thing, he noticed it was quite tall, seven feet or more in height. This thing let Dan know that he saw Dan by looking back directly at Dan, as he continued walking uphill towards the timber. He looked back at Dan several times without breaking his stride. His stride was long, longer than a man's, and was effortless as he walked through the snow. Dan thought, what kind of a man would be wearing a dark hairy suite that covered his entire body, out in the forest? Dan also noticed that this thing was much bigger than any man he has seen and it's build was very big! Dan felt it could weigh a good six hundred pounds or so. This creature disappeared into the timber. Dan knew he had seen something very unusual and he was aware of Big Foot sightings in the news.

"While Turkey Hunting in the Ingersol (Colockum Wildlife Area in Central WA.)on 4-15-05 I came across some fecies with a diameter of about 2"". Which at the time I thought to myself it must be a Huge Bear. The following day 4-16-05 I walked about a mile down a fire guard road above where I had seen the fecies. The fog was coming in and I had not seen any Turkeys so I turned around and headed for the truck. The Fog was getting thick and I could only see about 35 yards.About halfway to the truck the wind changed and was blowing down the hill. I smelt this awful musty skunky smell and the hair on the back of my neck stood up. I quickly turned facing the smell with my shotgun slung but I did not see or hear anything.Again I could only see about 35 yards because of the Fog.At this moment I felt it was the smell of a Sasquatch. Then I got to thinking about the Fecies and told myself it must be a Bear. That evening I called my Nephew because he was going Hunting with me Sunday 4-17-05. I told him their must be a Large Bear in the area because I saw the fecies on Friday and on Saturday I had smelled him.Sunday mourning we arived at Daylight where I had seen 5 Turkeys the day before.We got all of our gear ready and hiked about 300 yards up the hill. I took out my Turkey Box Call and started Yelping with it.A Howl started below us about 150 yards a Coyote that turned into a Wolf that turned into a roaring blood curling sceam! I am 47 Years old and have Hunted the Cascade Mt.Range all of my life! I have NEVER heard anything like it in my entire life. My nephew turned and looked at me He's 16 and said what is that? I looked him strait in the eye and said it is a Sasquatch. The Length and the Volume and the Depth of the Howl could not be duplicated by a human being.I asked my Nephew if his gun was loaded and if he wanted to try to get a look at it? He said yes.We moved a little closer toward the scream but did not see anything. It was in scatered Pine Trees.We headed back up the ridge and West aways and stopped. Again I took out my Turkey Box Call and started yellping. Again about 400 yards up the canyon we heard a Deep Long Howl. The creature was making his way up the draw at a high rate of speed.I yelped on the Turkey Call again and he Howled again!!!He was moving away into thicker Timber this time he was 500 to 600 yards away and we never heard him again.",about 3.3 Miles up the Ingersol Road.

"I work for BNSF railroad. I am an Engineer and have been working the Stevens Pass run for over 10 years now. I have heard many noises at the top of the pass over the years. I never said anything publicaly except there is a few of us that have experianced incidences and keep among ourselves. The 3 weeks since the snow has started to fall the noises are starting again.  Today as I was pulling my train out of the siding  I saw an odd foot print and thought  some one slipped and that's just a big hand. Then the train went another 100 yards over a bridge and again saw a more clear indication of what it was. Large long finger like foot with a open toes spread. I am a experianced hunter and have traveled to B.C. to hunt moose and trophy bear. In my home is a 7' black bear and this print don't even come close. I have seen a grizzly tracks in the wild. There were no claws! The train was moving about 6-7mph account coming from a stopped state. There were a total of 4 tracks. Spaced very...distant. I would see one then a ways saw another. It must have been walking down the middle of the tracks at one point. These were fresh and clean. I wish I stopped now. But,I can't stop the train and my conductor didn't believe me. I got home 2-1/2 hours ago from working over 14 hours and spent time looking on the web for a foot print and found that one from the Idaho site looked so close that it makes me nervous. Thats how I found this site. I have always believed in them and had 2 incidents one a posible sighting and another of one walking next to me on a hiking trip, on the back side of pilchuck mtn. on the walt bailey trail. Early Aug/2001 in a large meadow on our way back to the truck a good 3 miles yet away. It followed me and the dog(ex police dog german shepard, it was my friends and she didn't like me going by myself)The dogs head was in the back of my leg and scared like I had never seen him scared we had been hiking together for over 2 years. This happened for a good 1/4 mile untill I was to the edge of the ravine out of the dense tree/vegitation. I had my 44mag ready and have never been so scared in my life. It wasn't a cougar I have experianced that before it made sounds at me. Howl low tone eech and move making lots of noise, swat at brush. I would stop and look into the brush but to thick and saw something DARK but no outline. My hunting started at age 10 with the neighbor kid his dad had hounds. He was a guide. We participated in programs looking for grizzlys in the Cascade mtns. For the next 7 years I was with them every season for Bear, cougar, bobcat, racoon.

"This happened when I was still very young, perhaps it was 1953. The location was Holden Washington. My neighbor friend and I were playing in a sand box down by Miners' Creek. (Dad worked for How Sound Mining Co.) I looked up and saw a person in a fur coat across Miners Creek. It was Aug or late July and was hot outside. He was stepping from bolder to bolder and looking down at the waters edge making his way down stream toward us. I went and got my dad who collected a couple other adults and a pair of binoculars and went down by the Creek. I probably remember this incident because I saw the man in the fur coat first but none of the adults would let me look through the binoculars. I do remember them arguing about what it was they say. ""Can't be a man."" Can't be a bear they don't walk like that and step from bolder to bolder."" I remember that it was at a bend in the creek west of the Mine. Big scree field on that side of the Creek ment that there was not an easy way to get over there. The Creek flowed from the South West and turned East at this bend. That is if the valley runs East and West. The Creek was really noisy so didn't hear the men yelling for attention but did finally look up and noticed us. He turned and walked back up the creek. He walked back into pure wilderness;there is nothing to the Southwest of Holden WA. Dad is deceased so I can't ask him about it and wish I did. I am putting this report in because my sighting was in the middle of a blank spot on your map of sightings. Sightings ring it.

"My Wife and I Were traveling yesterday on the Lady of the Lake II out of Chelan Washington.  We were heading from Chelan to Stehekin on the north end of the Lake.  About half way up the lake we were dropping off 70 fire fighters at Lucerne.  Just as the Boat was leaving the landing I saw something large and dark walking on the shore were a creek (I believe it's called Holden creek) runs into the lake.  I saw it for a few seconds and told my wife that I thought I might have Just seen Bigfoot.  I showed her the spot and told her to keep looking while I got the camera.  She said ""I see it"" she said ""it looked like an orangatang but more upright."" I ran to the bow with my camera.  I looked around and saw the creature walking back up into the woods it had very dark brown hair covering its's entire body.  It looked to be between 7 and 8 ft tall and probably weighed between 400 and 450 lbs.  It had long arms and a long loping gate.  I fired off three pictures hoping to capture a picture of this amazing creature.  I ran in and told my wife and kids what I had seen.  I looked back at the digital images and initially saw nothing because I don't have a tele photo lense, but later that night in Stehekin I was loking at the pictures and zoomed in on the part of the shore wher I had seen the creature and there he was!  I had started to doubt what we had seen but now I have A picture to prove it to me when I begin to doubt it.  I did not necessarily believe before this.  Nad my wife and I were definitely not looking for bigfoot when we both saw him.

"My wife and I spent all summer camping at the thousand trails resort in Plain WA.On the night of September 22 2012, we were spending time out by the camp fire. The campground was mostly empty. This is a very large campground 18 miles west of Leavenworth WA. It was around 11:30PM at night. We were drinking coffee and enjoying the warm starlit evening. I noticed a very strong sulfur musty smell. My wife said, ""Do you smell that?"" I told her that I did. In my 40 years of being in the northwest woods I have never smelled anything like it. In a few minutes, a medium piece of wood came flying into the camp. This piece of wood hit our trailer and bounced off it, and landed on our wood pile. We both were in shock. My wife said,  ""What the hell was that!?"" We both looked at each other and said, "" You don't think it was you know who?"" The smell left, but in a few minutes it came back. I asked my wife where my NIKON was. It was at this point that a rock came flying into camp. There were major fires all around us at the time. The animals in that part of the woods were majorly displaced during this time. There is more to this story. We would like to talk with a researcher to tell the rest.","Thousand Trails camp site. 20752 Chiwawa Loop Rd Leavenworth, WA 98626. 18 miles west of Leavenworth, WA",Chelan County,Washington,Summer,Report 36726: Possible nighttime encounter at a couple's campsite near Plain,47.83843,-120.55,9/22/2012,36726,Class B,c2d20udpj3,61.64,51.325,41.01,43.9,0.76,,0.25,0,0,,,Clear throughout the day.,0,5.61,319,0.13
"I live in the Olympics, and usually in the Spring I hear a high pitch scream in the forest about 600' from my cabin.  It is very scary, makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up, I go into my cabin, and I don't come out- this is mid morning time.  This year I didn't hear the screachy scream in the Spring.  I took my grandchildren for a walk in the woods in search of mushrooms and discovered a hole in the ground with branches over it.....???????????  It wasn't a tool dug hole in the ground, but that of an animal with the fine throwing of the soil.  I didn't think much of it since there was a beer can thrown in it, but still my curiosity was profound.  We left the woods.  Within a week of this happening, 70 ' across the road from my cabin came a very loud whistle, scream, and huge growling noise, all simultaniously, and witnessed by five people.  I have experienced rocks being thrown at my cabin, and the most scary was when I looked across the road a few nights ago and saw whitish blue bright eyes- with no lights shining on them!  Is this a Sasquatch?  It is frightening me very much.  Before this experience my daughter and I had been smelling something like rotten dead animal smell.....and it was coming from under my porch.......when I had the maintenance man look under there....nothing there!...but the smell.  A few days ago my daughter and I smelled the smell of fresh earth dug up two days in a row, but there has been no digging here.  If this is a Sasquatch, why isn't it leaving here and migrating?

"Upon request of Chris Bradley (BFRO investigator) I am submitting this report of what I believe to have been an encounter with a Bigfoot or Sasquatch. I Rodney Frank Williams (Rod) DOB 12/19/42 residing at P.O. Box 140 Joyce Washington give the following account in a sequence of events leading me to believe of an encounter with a Sasquatch (Bigfoot), according to information directly given and acquired through my personal investigation.  This happened in the Joyce Washington Clallam County area. 10/11/04:  At 0615 my two daughters Tamar 14 and Laura 13, were up before anyone else awoke, they heard a strange, prolonged noise from Laura's bedroom on the northwest corner of the house.  The bedroom window was opened but covered with plastic while the house was being painted.  Both girls were visually upset.  They said the noise came from the state forestland behind the chicken coup northwest of the house.  Immediately after hearing the noise the two dogs became very aggressive in barking.  When I questioned them as to what they heard Laura stated that it sounded like a combination of a whale and a dinosaur of which Tamar agreed.  Finding the answer comical I stated that I wasn't around 2 million years ago to know what a dinosaur sounded like.  ""like the dinosaur on Jurassic Park, Dad"".  Both affirmed that they did not hear a coyote and I was able to determine that it wasn't the bugle of a bull elk.  My wife Stella also heard the same noise thinking I was blowing my shofar. 10/12/04: The house painter returning from lunch, (he lives just behind the Joyce General Store) stated that two surveyors working at the corner of his property where it intersects Crescent Beach Road were spooked by loud, fierce growling where they were working. My house painter was commenting that the younger surveyor was really upset and the older was convinced that it was two bears in ""one-hell-of-a-fight"". The painter told me that there was a bad smell in the area. Within the hour I went up to the location to talk to the two men and found them to have left. This was about 1300. After fininshing up my business I took my Labrador (dog) and went into the forest in the general area of the reported incident. I immediatley came across what smelled like something rotten. I found no garbage or decaying carcass but did find several game trails and one main trail that leads up to the road that runs parallel to state highway 112 west of the Joyce General store. 10/13/04: At about 1100 I called the surveying company and talked to the supervisor. He told me that the two surveyors on that job had left and wouldn't be back to finish until Friday. I asked him about the bear fight and he told me that after talking to them that he believed that it was an encounter with a Sasquatch. I asked what would cause him to believe that over a bear fight, especially in that he was not present. He stated that he had encountered this type of behavior before while surveying in a remote area and once while hunting. Both times had the bad smell. 10/15/04: At 1100 I went to the area of the supposed bear fight and found the two surveyors working on the south side of the road. In questioning the older of the two he confirmed that it was two bears in a ""hell-of-a-fight"". I asked why two bears. He stated that two distinct noises from two distinct bears were making the noise. He stated that the fight was so furious that the bush and alder saplings were shaking, and that a fir tree was shaking like a twig from the bears banging themselves against it. He also stated that there was definitely a foul smell during the fighting. The younger of the two surveyors earlier stated to the painter that immediately after the fighting that whatever it was headed due south across the road towards the Olympic Mountains. He was not able to see it across the road from where he was but heard it going through the brush on the far side of the road. The older of the two then took me to the spot where they were surveying and pointed out the fur tree, which stood no more than 25 feet into thick brush from where they were standing. He told me that he wouldn't go into that bush unless he had a big gun  for protection. At about 1400 I went into the brush to inspect the fir tree and surrounding area. In cutting sign in the the area I found that the fir tree was eight inches thick eighteen inches up from the forest floor. The base of the fir was covered with a heavy coat of moss and numerous small twigs a foot to two feet long in the lower regions of the fir. The forest floor was beat-up pretty bad yet the moss on the fir tree was not disturbed, nor were any of the prominent twigs on the lower part of the fir disturbed. At about five feet up I did find one broken twig. I find it impossible for two bears to be fighting and banging into the fir even lightly and not disturb the moss or break the lower twigs and branches. I am 6'1'', 210 pounds and in good shape. Reaching up as high as I could I was able to easily reach and grasp the fir and at much smaller circumference, but barely able to shake this fir. Because of the temperate rain forest conditions that we experience the forest floor was covered with moss, and rotten vegetation making it difficult to cut sign on an actual footprint. I did find about 12 feet from the fir tree a pad print (much like a large wide human print dressed in a moccasin). I was able to determine that it was possibly a right foot because of what apeared to be a distinctive big toe. It measured about 15 inches long and was a minimun of 4 inches wide at the heal, and 5 1/2 to 6 inches wide at the top. The heavy brush receded as I went further into a more open environment with numerous alder saplings. Here I found what I know to be a humanoid type pad print. The toes curled into the forest floor the the big tow of the right foot breaking through the vegetation and leaving an obvious toe print in the wet dirt. The print was going from east to west in the direction of the fir tree. It measured 14 1/2 inches and otherwise the same as the other print. The half-inch difference would account for the curled toe. At 1430 I woke my neighbor form his nap (a logger) and took him to the location. He admitted to the big toe part of the print but was skeptical and said it was bear tracks. In searching the immediate area around the fir tree we found fur of which I feel belongs to a bobcat, lynx, or possible cougar pressed down into the forest floor and laying loose. 10/18&19/04: Searched the web concerning Sasquatch sighting and sounds, also read John A. Bindernagel's book, The Sasquatch. Possibly made a mistake in confiding with other local residents of my feelings of this being a Sasquatch. I have now told my neighbor and others that it was possibly a big bear in a fight with a lynx or cougar and that the prints were that of a large bow hunter in that it is bow season. With this, I am no longer looked at like a nut. 10/20/04: After finding on the Internet voice sounds of a Sasquatch I had my two daughters and wife listen to the different recordings. They each agreed that what they heard sounded like the whooing sound recorded by Dave Clevlan in a 1972 encounter in Estacada, Oregon. 10/23/04: Diana after returning home from a football game at around 2130 the night before placed two large pumpkins weighing about 15 pounds apiece next to the house under the eve. The next morning 10/24/04 when leaving for work she found one of the pumpkins had been moved and seemingly placed next to the rear tire of the van which was 25 feet from the pumpkins. Thinking that possibly one of the dogs or a raccoon had rolled it to the spot I looked closer. There was no indentation in the pumpkin indicating that it had been rolled across about 10 feet of gravel driveway. There were no teeth imprints on the stem. Diana's statement: ""I placed those two pumpkins next to the house, came inside, put the kids to bed, locked the doors, and nobody went out till I went to work the next morning."" Our driveway is 3/4 of a mile long into temperate forest. The dogs never alerted to anyhting during the night. Their doghouses are on the backsides of the house. They would not neccessarily alert to something coming out of the forest such as deer but would to anything coming down the driveway. 10/24/04: After returnig from a trip to Seattle, I went back into the area of the fir tree and cut sign again. I took the protective cover of the one distinct footprint and again confirmed to myself that it was humanoid in its nature. I took a direct bearing to the South towards the olympics and drove over to Highway 112 in a line with my bearing. Near this location I found an embankment coming up from a creek bed. On this embankment again I found what could have been a large pad print because of time and weather unable to be certain. It was in an excellent location to view the traffic and cross the road to good forest cover on the other side. In cutting sign at this location south of HWY 112 I found the terrain to be full of game trails and a straight shot up into the security of the Olympic Mountains. 10/25/04: At 0600 woke up to a noise that I was unable to identify. My daughter Laura told me that again she heard the same loud whooing sound but this time of a higher pitch and coming from deeper in the forest behind the chicken coup. I have decided to make a report of the incidents(s). 10/26/04 The dogs were very agitated during the early morning hours.  At 0630 when feeding the chickens I experienced a very horrible foul smell similar to rotten garbage.  It is hard to explain the smell except that with what I had learned in my investigation it made the hair on the back of my neck, no! the hair on my complete body stand on end.  I then realized why the surveyors would not venture into the forest on 10/15/04. 10/28/04:  Neighbors dog dragged a deerskin out from the woods.  The skin had been turned inside out as one would skin a rabbit.  One front leg was still in the hide.  Of interest was that the lower bone of the leg had been broke or twisted off like one would break a chicken bone.  Several people saw this.  Most belive that this was very possibly the work of poachers.  Of interest I found no evidence of neither a bullet or arrow wound in the hide. NOTE:  Both Salt Creek and the Elwha River were experiencing a record large salmon run during this time period.  The top of the estuary of the Salt Creek salmon run where the salmon bunch-up before running up-stream is in good cover with forested terrain to allow predators such as bear and sasquatch to traverse and feed without being detected.  What investigation I did of the area provided no evidence of bear or sasquatch. NOTE:  During the 1970's as a Border Patrol Agent assigned to the U.S. Mexican and an Immigration Inspector on the Canadian Border I had extensive training and experience in cutting sign or ""tracking"" illegal aliens and smugglers crossing our borders.  Also I have spent a large portion of my spare time back-packing the wilderness parts of the Pacific Northwest.  At no time have I ever run across any sign of a Sasquatch until now.",Covered in report.,Clallam County,Washington,Fall,Report 10091: Series of vocalizations around the town of Joyce,48.1368,-123.7349,10/11/2004,10091,Class B,c281b74cpv,60.54,56.885,53.23,52.14,0.9,0.67,0.92,0,0,,1024.82,Mostly cloudy throughout the day.,3,10,228,1.84
"Date: Oct. 2000. Location, lower Sol Duc River, FS Marker D2000, north of Hwy 110. This event happened during one of my many fishing trips to the Olympic Penninsula. I traveled this forest service road D2000. This is an off road private forest area owned by Rayonier. I fished the first turn out many times. Often at the first turn out, which is pretty isolated, I would hear big thuds when I would be outside my vehicle working on my fishing setup. It sounded like a huge rock bouncing back and forth, starting slow and then speeding up only to then abruptly stop. If I could describe it, I would say it went, Thud (2 seconds pass), then Thud (two more seconds would pass) then the thuds went quicker. Overall, it was Thud...Thud...Thud.Thud.Thud.Thud.Thud. Then it was silent. I thought it was odd, but I was armed with my Colt .45 and fearless. I was alone as I often was in those days. So that day I decided to go further down the trail, proud of my 4x4 and it's capabilities I reached the end of the road that had a 4x4 trail that ultimately ended near the river. When I fish I'm stealthy. I'm real silent when I approach the river. So after I parked and walked down to the river I started casting. I fealt kind of odd and frightened and I shrugged it off as just being alone in the woods. After my second cast I decided to have a cigarette. Dang nicotine! As soon as I used my lighter I heard a large crack in the bushes across the river from me. This was probably a distance of 40 feet. I looked up, startled to see the thick bushes moving alot across the river, but not too worried because I had the river as a safety buffer. It was thick brush and I thought it was an animal sleeping in the bushes. I saw a big brown figure moving in the bushes but I couldn't make out any details. The bank where the bushes were had a slope above it that was probably a 30 degree angle. This posed an uphill path for the figure in the bushes. Then, the next thing I know I see a tree, in the brush, probably two feet in width (not too big, but not too small)that suddently cracked and fell up the hill! It was apparent that whatever I saw had run into the tree, probably startled by my presence because about 10 feet away from that tree was another tree, that cracked and fell up the hill in the path of the brown creature hastly departing the bushes. After that, the creature was gone into the deep brush and forest adjacent to the river. I was convinced this was Bigfoot. Never in my life had I experienced a tree cracking and falling up hill or the sight of something that large that had moved so quickly. I immediately pulled out my gun and ran back to the truck. I drove very quickly out of the area with my heart racing.",,Clallam County,Washington,Fall,Report 6058: Sol Duc River fisherman experiences large animal crashing through heavy brush,47.9477,-124.5301,4/5/2005,6058,Class B,c0x2y0xgw7,48.05,47.75,47.45,39.04,0.74,0.99,0.89,0.0235,1,rain,1016.85,Breezy in the morning and rain throughout the day.,4,8.96,132,18.25
"At 3:45 in the morning on Shi Shi Beach N., myself and two other backpackers woke up to the sounds of my dog running after something. The dog ran 50 feet away from our sleeping site on the beach to the ridge that separated the N and lower beaches. There were sounds of grappling/contact between my dog and the animal. I thought it was a raccoon that my dog had attacked but when I ran to the area underneath the ridge I saw an enormous figure in the dark. The first words to come out of my mouth were ""identify yourself!"" The figure made no growling sound, no sound as it moved, and had no backpack or headlamp. I think it kicked the dog to get away from it. After my friend comes up behind me and grabs the dog somehow, I manage to find the headlamp after 5 minutes. Before we can turn it on and look at the ridge, my friend looks over my shoulder and sees a human figure/torso approach the top of the ridge, set its hand down on a large rock next to it, and then disappear. He remarked about the size of its arms in comparison to the rest of its body. During the initial struggle, my friend also notes a sound he heard. It was an elk-like horn sound that was similar to moaning. I didn't feel like the sound was directed at me but we were in a cove and the figure was fleeing - sounds bounce around. My friend also suggested the idea that the figure ran UP the ridge at a 35 degree angle which is not possible for a human. I convinced myself that it was a human assailant coming to steal our backpacking gear... Yet the figure did not identify itself, was not wearing a headlamp, and somehow scaled the cliff in pitch black. By far the creepiest backpacking experience I have ever had.","Directions to the site: Drive through Neah Bay on the Makah Reservation and continue down towards the trailhead (near the fish hatchery). Take the trail a few miles to the beach, go down the switchbacks at the very end of the trail. Go to the beach and go N for 100 yards. There will be a rocky/cliff divider between the main beach and the smaller northern one.

"My three friends and fellow soldiers recently spent a three day camping trip into Olympic National Forest Elwha River Trail. We had to return to cell coverage, so myself and my buddy headed out of the forest and north on the main trailhead. The night before was a heavy thunder storm so the trail was very muddy. I was a leading us out and stumbled upon a very clear muddy print of a left foot. I wear a size 11 mens boot and to me this was clearly a size 14-15. The print seemed recent and had clearly defined toes and arch. We only had a cellphone to take the picture with and regrettably only took the one. The tracks, that seemed to be from the same source (none as clearly defined), went on heading north on the trail an additional 25-30 feet. That night we decided it was in our best interest with the horrible weather to make camp at one of the historical cabins on the trail. We retrofitted a poncho in one of the open windows to shelter us from the rain and wind. We secured it by weighing the bottom half down with a 2x2 piece of wood. During the heaviest gusts of wind it seemed to hold up. At approx 0100 hrs the tarp was opened and something knocked the piece of wood onto one of my fellow campers.

"I have often thought I saw someone run  across the road while I deliver the paper. I often stopped to use the restroom in the same spot. I heard funny noises, but thought it was a bear or some other animal grunting and what not. Last night (about 4:30 AM actually, so this morning) I was stopped along the road looking over my route sheet, when out of the corner of my eye I saw someone walking. I slowly reached up and turned off the light. I put the car in gear, and looked over. What I saw made the hair stand on the back of my neck, and got tears in my eyes. It wasn't 7 feet tall, more like 6 feet or so -  I'm guessing, because it didn't seem to be bending over too far to look at me. It was maybe 5 or 6 feet away from my car. I was so frightened that I drove off as fast as I could. I called 911 and they thought I was a nut, and said it was most likely a vagrant, or homeless guy.

"On May 9th, 2002 at approximately 3p.m. my buddy and I were headed towards Mt. St. Helens.  We had just passed Hoffstead Bluffs heading east and I was looking down into the wash.  The Toutle splits in this area and there was a section that went between a heavily wooded area and the hillside leading to the road.  It is approximately 300 yards to the bottom.  I noticed something walking thru the creek at an angle and heading northeast.  It happened quickly and I yelled instantly to stop.  I saw it for maybe 5 seconds.  I could see the space between its strides and I knew it had to be much bigger than a man from that distance.  The arms were long and it was dark colored.  We didn't get stopped quick enough for both of us to see it.  We scanned the entire area for at least 10 to 15 minutes but saw no other movement.

"I took a 3 day/2 night solo backpacking trip in Washington state, up the Ape Canyon Trail, around the base of Mt. St. Helens, and through the Muddy River drainage this past July 5th through 7th.   On the  first day of the hike at around 1 pm, as I made my way up the Ape  Canyon Trail, I was surprised to hear a series of ""whooping"" calls, a  series of 5 whoops in a row spaced at intervals of about 30 seconds to  1 minute apart, 5-7 sets over the course 10-15 minutes.  The calls (bwaaahh-bwaaahh-bwaaahh) sounded as if they were emanating  from the bottom of an oil drum, the tone being deep and bodily palpable, even though sounding maybe a mile or more away in the direction of the canyon, and somewhat north of the trail. It struck  me as unnaturally deep and projecting (although not overly loud) and unlike any animal call I had ever heard before (I have hiked and camped in forest and wilderness areas for many years).  I did not hear any  other calls during course of my hike, save what sounded like an  enormous owl hooting near my tent site on the edge of the Muddy River drainage on my 2nd night, at around 2 am.  It was very loud and I was not inclined to get out of my tent for a look-see.  One other thing I found intrigued me though.  On a game trail that slips off of the main trail, just down hill from a ground spring adjacent to the trail 1-2 miles from the trailhead, I came across a couple of downed trees approx. 4-5"" in diameter, twisted or snapped off and laying across the trail in a cross-x pattern. The trees were placed on the trail between the spring and a small meadow farther down the hill.   There were no signs of a lightening strike, no evidence of chopping or sawing was apparent, and the trees looked otherwise healthy and normal, and looked as if they had been pulled over and broken off toward the top of the tree.","From Cougar, Washington, drive North on HWY 83 to the Ape Canyon trailhead, hike for 1-2 miles, keep a lookout for a small ground spring off the trail downhill to the left.

"Hello .The year was 2006, July.  The time was eight thirty PM. We were driving back from Mt. St. Helens, Washington. It was a sunny day so we went to see the mountain that day. We were driving down the road along side the Toutle River which was to the right of the van. We were in my family van at the time. We been driving some time on the road. I had my RCA video camera fully charged ready to go. I was in the back seat of the Ford Areostar van and my daughter in the seat in front of me. She was about 8 years old then. When out of the corner of my eye I spotted a large brownish red gray ... what I thought was a bear at first, standing in the Toutle River up to its middle calf. It had to be 9 feet tall. It was in the water about 5 feet from the bank. The sunlight was shining on this creature. It was massive in size stature and girth. You could see the arm muscles, back  dorsal muscles, leg muscles, buttock, and thigh muscles. It was facing back side to us. The head was the size of a five gallon bucket, massive. I was so shocked at what I was seeing. It was no bear at all. It had massive shoulders. You could see all the muscles through the dense hair. It was amazing .This was the elusive Sasquatch. It looked like a giant massive hairy man with massive arms they were long. It had to be a male. It was looking down as though he was fishing or looking to find something to eat. I was so amazed at what I was seeing I said, ""Hey Meg look at that."" That is the name of my daughter. She saw it too. To this day she still remembers what she saw and believes it was a bigfoot. I told my brother in law, he was driving my van at the time, to slow down and pull over, I want to video tape something real important. He said he did not believe me. He wanted to get back home. It pissed me off so bad. I WOULD OF HAD THE VIDEO OF THE Sasquatch! It was a once in a lifetime thing if your lucky to see one. If you ever get a chance to see one you will never forget it. It's always in my mind. I painted a picture of it. It turned out well. This is a true story I stake my life on it. Hope to here back from you soon. Sorry about my spelling.

"I'd like to begin by saying that with the discovery of this web site I have found what could be the first confidence I have ever felt in reporting to you what I'm about to relate. Thank you for founding this site and giving real legitimacy to bring this subject to the light of day. The encounter began when I took my fiance' L. for a late afternoon drive up Spirit lake highway. L. is not from this area and I wanted to take her for a drive to see the sites  before the sun set. The encounter began the moment I pulled the Dodge Dakota over into the upper part of the ""Elk Meadows"" observation parking lot. It was at this time full dark and I could not see more than a few feet into the darkness. The weather had been unstable with wind and rain showers all day. The lot was wet from a recent passing shower. As soon as we stopped I turned off the ignition and let things settle for a minute. L. and I both opened our windows a little ways so they wouldn't fog and just enjoyed a moment of quiet. Thats when we both heard some vocalizations that were soft but distinctive up on the hillside across the highway from us. I said: did you hear that? she said yes. I said lets listen for a minute and it kept on like a sort of conversation with itself. We both had the sensation that the voice was speaking towards us down in the parking lot. It was a soft chatter that you might hear chimps make at the zoo when entertaining themselves alone. Then there was a shift in the sounds it made by way of two rocks being pounded together in a two or three beat rythymn. Then there was some more chatter with the pounding that sounded a little more urgent and frustrated than at first. Fascinated by all this I told my wife-to-be to stay put and I'm getting out to get a better bearing on this sound making over across the highway and up the hill from us. She was starting to get spooked and I didn't want her to panic thinking if I went to see what was going on in a causal way she'd stay calm. I told her I needed to relieve myself so I opened the door of the truck and stepped around in back of the doorpost looking towards the rear of the vehicle and took care of business. This is when things escalated. I could then hear footsteps coming down the side of the hill toward us in the lot. Sound was carrying very well in the clear air of this evening with little breeze. I could tell from the footfalls it was coming at a angle from right to left down the hill, fast! There was dirt and small rocks being pushed aside by the footfalls and the loose rocks were rolling from under its feet.  Very definately a two footed descent. Not the sound of an elk or bear on fours as I have seen and heard this kind of noise from normal elk and deer movements. I wondered why someone would be out at this hour up there on the hillside messing with tourists out for a drive. It didn't add up. I knew that all the hunting seasons were closed and there were no other vehicles in the lot nor had we seen any parked along side the road for at least 10 miles further back. It just was not likely that this was a poacher who had lost his way trying to get a ride back home tonight. The footfalls kept coming my way and they were making heavy slaps like someone wearing swim fins or was barefoot and had exceptionally large feet starting to cross the lot behind the truck about 40 feet or so behind our parked truck. It was not running but rather quickly walking across the lot right in front of me and I could not see it but just hear it very close. I jumped in the truck and turned the head lights and fog lamps on and gunned the engine to get us up about 20 feet to go around the burm dividing the lot to get turned around and the truck facing whatever was walking across it. This maneuver took all of 5 seconds and by the time I got the lights on the center of the lot all I could see was the motion of something bipedial and very large throwing it's legs over the concrete barrier at the back of the lot about 60 feet from us pivoting on one hand like a gymnist going over a pommel horse and gone in an instant. There was crashing and rocks rolling and the sound of dirt flying down this 60 or 70% hill. I had stopped, put the truck in park and stood outside the cab behind my door listening to all these retreating sounds of something very large and heavy going down this embankment. I asked if L. if she had seen anything but she only heard what I had heard and saw. I closed the door and told her to lock them all. Taking a flashlight with me I went over to the highway and looked at the foot prints of mud crossing the road leading from the hill side. It started to rain again. Taking a closer look shining my light on the tracks they were spaced about 4 1/2 feet apart. My feet are size 12 and when I placed my foot next to a muddy track the outline of the track was half again longer and wider than mine.  It took me a long stride plus a short one for me to span the distance between each foot print. These tracks were only moments old.  The tracks led from the top of the hillside at an angle from right to left and out of the ditch, up over the highway, over to the parking lot and over the side of the concrete retaining blocks at the edge of the lot where I saw the creature vault over the side. I walked the distance with my flashlight from the ditch to the retaining wall looking at the muddy foot prints. My hair had never stood so strait on end as at that moment and I was morbidly fascinated with the last several minutes, maybe 7 or 8 minutes all together. I got back in the truck after convincing L. it was just me coming to the door.  I took a deep breath and started the truck and said to L. it was just about time to go and we left for home down in Toutle lake. It was raining.",Elk meadows observation pull out parking area.,Cowlitz County,Washington,Fall,Report 26567: Sasquatch sighted crossing Elk Meadows parking lot near Toutle Lake,46.2965,-122.3431,11/18/2006,26567,Class A,c21p2h02xj,41.55,39.97,38.39,34.7,0.94,0.78,0.93,0,0,,1020.17,Mostly cloudy throughout the day.,1,8.59,136,2.11
"Four of my friends and I were camped out below the Climbers Bivoac Area of St Helens National Monument.We pulled the motorhome over onto a short logging road (FS #83) off the side road to Lava Canyon,about 2mi past the jct with the Climbers Bivoac Road.We had arrangements to climb St Helens on Monday but arrived early Sat and did some hiking/mtn biking for a couple days beforehand.In the early morning hours of Monday Aug6th 2007,half of us awoke to a strange distant howling which none of us had ever heard before.We speculated that it was possibly a bear that got caught in a trap. It definately wasnt a cougar scream as I've heard them before a few times.It wasnt an elk either.All we could think of at the time was that it was possibly a bear.But yet it seemed way too loud for a bear especially with it seeming to be coming from a distance.This noise went on for about 15 minutes before it faded away.I have listened to some of the audio recordings on your website and they sound quite similar to what we heard.We camped in the same spot the day before and the day after our successful climb up St Helens (awesome weather the day we went)for 3 nights total but we heard the noise only one night.",State Route #503 past town of Cougar approx 5mi to Jct with FS#81.

"All I have to say is I have never been more scared in my life. I have been a hunter for fifteen years now, knowing, and enjoying the woods more than anywhere else on this planet. This incident happened saturday night, Sept. 12 down a gated logging road above a fish hatchery. It was elk season for bow hunting, and my buddy wanted to go try for an elk. I knew my other buddy was already down hunting elk near castle rock, so I said lets go down there. Since I only hunt modern firearm, I was not hunting elk, but I brought my rifle because bear season was open. We got down there saturday morning about four a.m. . We did a morning hunt, then took a break back at camp during the middle of the day. For our evening hunt we decided to head east past the town of Toutle about two to three miles. Right before a shell station on your right, we took a left. We drove for a little while until we came across a fish hatchery. We decided to turn around and park at a gate right up the road from the fish hatchery. We all walked in together (4 of us total). When we came to a Y in the road we decided to split up. We continued walking, and thats when I kept hearing something walking in the woods to my right. I mentioned to my buddy that something was pacing us in the woods, so we left that road and headed down an old grassy side road that hadnt been used in a while. When we got to the end of the road I stepped off the road to look down an embankment (trying to see the river)and thats when I heard a deep rumble of a growl, and it seemed to be right next to me. I signaled my buddy to come quick, and I kept looking in the brush, but couldnt see anything. We sat there for a minute, then we heard this thing move around, but it never came out of the brush. We decided to leave that spot and head back to a little clearing we had seen on the way in. I also noticed that all the animal sign in the area was old. There was no fresh tracks or feces of any kind that I saw in the area, which discouraged us since we were looking for elk. We went back to the clearing and sat there until it was dark. Since our other buddies went further up the road than us, we went back to the Y in the road and waited for them. When it became pitch black and they hadnt returned, we decided that we better head toward the truck. As we were walking, I heard the brush move a couple of times, again to my right. I said to my buddy, it sounds like something is in there. He said he had heard that, so we continued walking and listening. Then it seemed to get louder, like someone was just walking through the brush without trying to be quiet. For about a half mile, this thing, whatever it was, paced us and would not leave, no matter how loud we got. We walked the rest of that half mile back to back. I had a flashlight thats built into my hat, and I had that aimed into the woods with my gun pointed right in that direction. When we got back to the truck, our other two buddies were already in his truck with it running. They said they had popped out onto the main road and walked back to the truck from another direction. I want to note, whatever it was that was pacing us sounded way bigger than a cougar. I would also say that it wouldnt be a bear, since bear tend to be skiddish, and will usually run away from you. The growl that I heard was very deep, but not loud. It was a low rumble that seemed to shake me. Like I said before, I love the woods, and spent my whole life getting out camping, fishing, and hunting. I have never had something like this happen to me before. The only animal I saw the whole time was a bat, and that was when it was almost dark. I didnt even notice a bird the whole time we were down this road.","[Edited] Off interstate 5 take exit 49, head east out of Castle Rock 6 or 7 miles to the town of Toutle.

"I'm going to put down three different incidents that has happened since I move to the mountains of northeast washington. The first I have already reported. It happened back in march of '05. It was about 1 or 1:30 in the morning and it was pretty warm in my room, so I got up to open the window. As I was standing there let the cool air hit my face I heard a cry that was kind of what I would have to say a moan/growl. It was coming from the hill that is in front of the house I live at. I have lived up here since '96 so I get to hear the sounds of nature and I can say for sure this wasn't anything I've ever heard before. I didn't even think it could be a bigfoot until the next week when I told my dad. He told me son I think you heard a bigfoot. I wasen't ready for that, then he tried to tell me what it would sound like from what other people reported and that was what I heard that night. The second is like the first close to where I heard the first. I was on a back road between my house and the next road over. It was dusk out and I was coming to an intersection just before I got to a cattleguard when I heard something. I stopped and turned off my truck to listen better. I stuck my head out the window when I heard the some type of moan/growl as in first. This time I got pretty excited. It was coming from behind and on a high bald hill to the east of where I was. This incident happened in august of '08. Now for number three. This happened back in '08 but in Febuary when there was snow on the ground which dosen't make walking very easy. Well I went to this hill over looking the area I live which is above my friends place. I have walked this same area for awhile and this is this first time I ever found a foot print. As I was starting to climb out of a dip in the hill there it was. I thought it was weird for someone to be out in the snow in their bare feet. As I stood there looking at the print I remember what I read in some reports find something to compare the size to. Two problems one I didn't get my digital camera until may and all I had to compare the size to was my size 13 foot. The size of that print out did me by three sizes. Can someone tell me I have a 13 foot and stand at 6'.

"My cousin and I were hunting up a dead end road, and were sitting outside our truck waiting for a buck to show up. We had gotten out of the truck originally because we had seen two does on the right side of the vehicle in a empty pond. On the our left side we were hearing branches break and bushes move, hoping it was a big buck. After waiting 20 minutes or so, we changed our position to in order to hopefully get a better angle as to what was making noise in the brush, when doing so the two does went north of our position trotting away, less than 15 seconds after that we both heard a sound like a deep roar tailing off to a squealing sound at the same time, an undescribable sound, not a bear, wolf, coyote or cat. Literally seconds after that the same two deer sprinted past us within just 5 to 7 feet as if we werent there and the least of the their concern. After they ran a few seconds after that we heard heavy footed running along the ridgeline above the empty pond, and at this point we ran in the vehicle and took off.

"I have two personal accounts and at least one second hand accounts to report. I was encouraged to share them by a recent aquaintance, Nate H. I would like to be contacted by phone at your convenience to give a more detailed description of the encounters and specific locations. That said, I will briefly describe the incidents. All occurred in Ferry County, Wa. The first was back in the mid 80's. I was 20 or 21 and would pack in by myself on 3-4 day mule deer hunts in the high country. I was camped mid-mountain overlooking the Sherman Creek drainage. At dusk I heard a long ""howling"" call from far below me that literally caused my hair stand on end. It started very low and and cresendo'd at a medium level, lasting maybe ten seconds and repeating twice. Oooowwwwuuuuuuu. I have heard everything in the woods, including bull beef cattle, and I knew instinctually what this was. My remaining nights on that hunt were spent sleepless. I never spoke to anyone about it, fearing ridicule. Four years later I was stationed in SE Alaska and my father in law (an avid hunter) came up to go on a brown bear hunt with me. Late on the night after our life threatening kill of a dandy bruin, we were imbibing in some whiskey in our remote cabin. The comraderie of the hunt coupled with the whisky loosed our tongues and I told him of my experience years prior, with his promise of secrecy. With the same promise from me, he related an actual sighting he had not five miles from where I heard the ""call"" He was a UPS driver and his route took him over Sherman Pass on HWY 20 on a daily basis. It was early spring and he was just below the summit when he saw what appeared to be a long haired ""hippie with a backpack"" trucking through the tall brush up ahead on the west side of the HWY. He slowed down and as he came abreast of it (about 20 mph)their eyes met. It was instant recognition an the BF did a 90 down the hill. As to my knowledge, he has never told another soul. Jump ahead appx 20 years. My hunting partner and I were driving a remote section of road after dark to try and find concentrations of deer tracks to hunt some new areas about twenty miles from Canada and forty miles north of the aformentioned incidents. There was appx 16"" of snow and maybe 4"" of new over the last vehicle tracks. We came upon a strange set of extremely large tracks and got out to investigate, thinking they were cougar. However, these were unmistakably bi-ped, and HUGE!I wear size 13 and they were at least 4"" longer than my insulated boot footprint. In addition, the stride was so long that we had to jump to mimic the distance between them. The tracks followed the road for appx a mile, mainly holding to the ""uphill"" side of the road and sporadically moving to the downhill side when the view was more expansive.

"My son and I were heading north on hiway 109 just north of Moclips, WA.  We were in my pick-up truck and I was driving. It was cloudy, but no rain.  The sun had just set but there was still plenty of light.  109 is a two lane road along the ocean and there wasn’t any other traffic, so I was driving sort of slow and enjoying the nice summer evening.  As I was driving, I was enjoying the view to my left and just caught a glimpse of a decent sized animal that darted from right to left across the road and into the left ditch, where I lost sight of it as I drove past.  As I drove I continued to look to my left to take in the view when movement near the road ditch to the left side of my truck caught my attention.  I turned my head to look out the driver’s window and saw some sort of animal running on all fours in the ditch to the left beside the back of the truck about 25 feet away.  It was easily keeping up with the truck as I drove about 35 mph.  My mind couldn’t identify what sort of animal it was so after a quick look at the road I looked at the animal again.  My instant reaction was that the animal looked like an ape based on how it was built and how it was moving.  I’m no ape expert, but I’ve seen them in the movies and TV and that’s what it looked like.  After another quick look at the road, I turned to view the animal again but it was gone. We saw it for maybe 10-15 seconds.  It was about 3 feet tall as it ran on all fours, stocky and thick with a dark brownish color.  It had hair/fur of a uniform length of about 3 inches all over.  One of the reasons it reminded me of an ape so much was the way it’s front legs were longer than it’s back legs making it’s hind end lower than it’s front end as it ran.  Because I could only get short looks at the animal as I was also driving, the face was all a blur and I didn’t see any details.  I’ve been in the woods and outdoors all my life working, hunting and playing in Washington and Alaska and I’ve seen many animals and this was like nothing I’d ever seen before.  After the sighting, my son and I drove to a restaurant and tried to make sense of what we saw, but couldn’t.  I’d filed it away as a mystery until my cousin told me recently that its believed sasquatch young run on all fours and it suddenly made sense.",A mile or two north of Moclips on highway 109.,Grays Harbor County,Washington,Summer,Report 28781: Two witnesses see strange quadruped from truck near Moclips,47.2838,-124.2306,8/1/2002,28781,Class A,c0rsvpf015,58.2,55.875,53.55,48.36,0.82,0.41,0.76,,,rain,1019.95,Foggy in the morning.,8,8.25,305,7.97
"My experience happened a few years ago on a logging road between Wishkah, WA and Montesano,WA. The logging road we were on takes you out to the Wynoochie lake. A friend of mine and I were driving out to meet some friends who were camping. They were a few miles back off the paved road. We stopped the truck to get out and check the bed to make sure we had everything before we got too deep out in the woods. Like food, beverages etc.. It was just getting dark so we had the headlights on and the dome light lit up everything around us, so we couldn't see a few feet (10+ or so from the truck). We both get in the truck about the same time and close the doors, dome light goes off and we notice something standing roughly 15-20' ahead of us, in the middle of a single lane logging road. We were in a lifted Toyota Tacoma, I'm about 6'4 and the truck was taller than me. What we saw was grey-ish brown colored and fully covered in hair. The part of the road we were parked was cut out from a small hill. The banks were roughly 6' high on each side of the road. Before we could take a picture, honk, do anything at all, from a standing position it jumped up and was up and over the bank. The headlights didn't show the exact height but in my guess it had to be at LEAST 7'. I'm over 200lbs and it made me look like a baby. To this day, I still haven't gone down that logging road. If you'd like to know the exact place, it is called the A-Line on top of 13 corners. We were traveling from Wishkah side so the road was on our left. I've always been a believer in Sasquatch, my grandpa was a logger a long long time ago and actually worked while they were building roads to the dam. He told me all about the weird knocks, sounds that he would hear while staying in the cabins out there. I'm in my mid 20's and have lived in the country for the past 10 years. Love camping and being in the outdoors. I tell all my friends about my experience and still after all these years it still gives me goosebumps when I tell it. I'll never forget that.","Traveling from Aberdeen,WA. Head out B Street to Wishkah road. Follow Wishkah road for 10 or so miles. Wynoochie-Wishkah road will be on your right side.

"On July 29th,2004 my mother,aunt, and I were leaving the Lake Quinault Lodge after having lunch there.  We decided to take the shortcut between Neilton and the Lake Quinault park turnoff to go towards the ocean at Moclips.  About a mile from the Quinault fish hatchery we all saw something none of us believed in.  It was very tall, dark brown hair, walked on two legs like a man but resembled a gorilla, (sort of).  This was at about 2:30 in the afternoon, no rain, clear day with sunshine.  It crossed the road a few hundred feet in front of my pick-up.  When it crossed, it didn't seem to be in any hurry, glanced breifly our way and continued as if we were unimportant.  It's stride was such that it easily stepped from the road back into the brush without losing any momentum.  I stepped on the gas to try to get a better look as this thing was moving fairly good clip but didn't seem to be running but just moving right along.  I would say it was approximately 8' tall.  I say this as I am almost six feet tall and this thing towered over my truck.  This was NOT some guy in a suit, as the area is fairly isolated and not many cars go down this road.  In fact, we only saw two more cars on that road until we reached the ocean turnoff.  It was also not a bear, or at least no bear I have ever seen to walk like this did.  It was also hunched over somewhat or didn't have any neck but gave me the impression of being hunched forward somewhat.  It was not scruffy or dull colored hair but appeared to be healthy especially the way the thing moved.",about 1 mile from the Quinault hatchery,Grays Harbor County,Washington,Summer,Report 14112: Afternoon sighting by motorists near Quinault Fish Hatchery,47.3631,-123.9718,7/29/2004,14112,Class A,c0rv6ynqp9,80.2,68.3,56.4,55.98,0.76,1,0.43,0,0,,1016.43,Overcast throughout the day.,4,6.98,274,1.84
"I returned from a two hour drive to Seattle Saturday night, after visiting family for an early Christmas celebration. I walked onto my back porch and noticed an unrecogizable sound. Since I'm into nature observation and tracking, and had heard audio recordings of alleged Sasquatch vocalizations, this possibility was in the back of my mind. I walked to the edge of the ravine and listened intently to the patterns of barks and growls. They were more audible than any canine and had an order to them which reminded me of sogbirds, repeating notes over and over. They didn't sound like any coyotes or elks or other fauna. I went into a slight panick at the thought of it being a Sasquatch, which I was sure it was. I ran back to my house as fast as I could and grabbed my tape recorder which I usually use for recording bird songs. I spent the next twenty minutes waving the microphone into the night air. I then went back inside to see if it was working, but found to my dismay that the battery in the microphone was dead! By the time I got it working, the animal had stopped vocalizing. Throughout this twenty minute period, several dogs gradually began barking with greater and more frequent intensity. It was interesting to contrast the difference in the dogs barking to the complex patterns of the alleged Sasquatch noises. The sounds were more structured, they had a greater range of expression and caried further through the forest. The next day, I went out on foot to the spot and found the broken and trampled branches, the ripped tarp, the coyote carcass, the dog food bowl and the unknown animal scat. I surmised this was a form of territorial marking. Perhaps the Bigfoot picked up the items from a backyard or killed the coyote. There didn't appear to be any recent human activity there. There were no regular trails, the terrain was steep, and slippery, the nearest house about 800 feet away. Tommorrow I am planning to return with my camera and a flash, extra film and a ziploc bag or two to collect any samples, and document the site.","In dense lowland forest, the ravine behind my property, which is semi-wilderness about a mile from the city limits where the real wilderness begins.",Grays Harbor County,Washington,Winter,Report 10062: Man Hears Evening Vocals in Prior Sighting Area,46.988,-123.8647,12/18/2004,10062,Class B,c0rgm3ukzq,58.85,52.195,45.54,47.07,0.91,0.41,0.25,0.0007,0.5,rain,1028.71,Overcast in the morning.,1,8.91,87,5.22
" My buddy and I went out deer hunting on 10/15/05 opening day. We were going to a favorite spot of his on [a particular road in the area].  Anyway, we got to the spot at about 6:00am still dark, we sat in the truck till it got light enough to see better. We were at the start of the spur truck not running, windows down. We were talkin when I noticed a loud sound on my side of the road, it was stick beating. There were loud 7 slams in a row. It stoped for maybe 5 seconds  then 7 more from further off in the distance. This went on for aprox 8 minutes. I asked my buddy if he was hearing it and he said yes but he thought it was just a hunter trying to spook up deer. I don't think so ...  why would somebody do that back in the woods an hour and a half before daylight? At one point later on a low bed truck came down the road, most likely to pick logging epuipment. When the truck got closer the driver of the truck stopped, then quickly shined a spotlight in the timber around where we heared the beating. He then took off grabing the gears fast (I know because I drive a log truck too.) The stickbeating stopped after that. However, when we did hear the beating, they were very hard and heavy bangs. I'm 6'2"" 250 lbs and I tried to make the same sound, to describe to my brother in law what I heard. The loudest knock sounds I could make weren't even close to what I heard.

"I've been debating whether to report this to you guys for about a month. Sorry for the delay but what I saw doesn't seem explainable other than a sasquatch. I was staying at a place called Mariner Village about 5 miles south of Ocean Shores. It's about 1/4 mile from the north jetty at Browns Pt. The time is about 1:30am (I knew this because I had just left my room at 1:20 am to return to my fire on the beach). My back was to the ocean watching the fire. I turned to look at the ocean (which was about 30 yards away) and saw what I thought was a person walking south along the water line down the beach. The moon was full and when I first saw it, it was directly west of me. What I could see was a dark figure from about mid-torso up because the beach slopes down quite a bit in that area. It appeared to be just a person out for a late night/early morning stroll on the beach. So I decide to follow them, maybe go talk to them and start walking at an angle down the beach to cut them off. Seeing that I wasn't catching up to them I start running down the beach still at an angle in there direction. It was hard to make out detail while running so I stopped to get a better look. That's when I realized the following, with the full moonlight I could see only it's upper body and it was all black, it had no neck, looked like it was wearing a hooded sweatshirt. I start running again as fast as I could. This thing was fast, it must have covered the 1/4 mile from where I first saw it down to about 50 yards from the jetty in about a minute and a half. I stop running and I could see it way down the beach about 200 yards away. It stopped about 50 yards from the jetty turned and faced the ocean. It was at an area on the beach that I saw it's feet turn towards the incoming waves. It's movements seemed very unnatural and overexagerated. When it turned towards the ocean it flexed it's back like it was leaning backwards. It seemed like it was looking back to see where I was. I know it saw me standing by the fire, I had a white t-shirt on and a shaved head, and probably saw me go after it, that's why it got down the beach so fast. It moved off and when it got near the shadow of the jetty I lost sight of it. That's when I decided to turn around and go back. Tried to find tracks but it was moving along the water line at high tide, the waves would have covered them up. The next day I took my friend told him to go stand down by the water and stood in the spot I first saw it, I could barely see the top of his head. Like I said I didn't report this for awhile because it's hard to fathom this happening in such a populated area. But considering the surrounding area, Oyhut State Game Refuge is very close and only 6 miles away is thick forested area to the north,one of these creatures could travel that distance easily in the cover of darkness. Once it got to that jetty it leads to the game refuge. If you have the book ""Meet The Sasquatch"" on page 213 that's the shape of what it looked like when I first saw it.",On beach in front of Mariner Village (condos) about 1/4 to 1/3 mile north of the north jetty,Grays Harbor County,Washington,Summer,Report 12594: Possible beach sighting at night by a tourist near Point Brown,46.92694,-124.1736,10/29/2005,12594,Class B,c0rdyqg91r,55.65,51.93,48.21,47.46,0.89,0.5,0.89,0.0079,1,rain,1020.73,Mostly cloudy in the morning.,2,9.58,174,2.29
"Driving home around 3AM returning from my sister's house, I came around the bend on 'B' Street in Aberdeen, after (Stewart?) Park, when I saw a huge upright figure with dark fur. It seemed like it probably had just come from the river side of the road, and didn't seem too concerned that I was driving past.  It was watching me pass the same as I was watching it.  I was in disbelief, and didn't even think to stop, or even wake my then boyfriend. I know this figure wasn't a bear, I know that it wasn't just a huge man in a fur coat.  I do know that what I saw was a Sasquatch. Since it was dark, the only real description I can give is that it was huge, probably around 7', it was mostly upright, with a slight slouch, and the fur looked somewhat matted.","The location was on 'B' street in Aberdeen.

"My boyfriend E. P. and I were with our good friend D. I. who was driving an F150 pickup truck.  We had gone up onto the logging roads for the boys to teach me how to shoot a shotgun better. It is very desolate and has very thick forests. We went in near the Elma/Satsop, WA area and drove for hours.  We ended up getting lost but knew the A and B line roads (which we were on from what the Garman told us) came out somewhere near Capitol forest. By this time it was pretty late and we were ready to go home. We ended up turning around somewhere in between and found ourselves going around a corner with a hill coming down on the left hand side that had lots of tall pine trees and low laying brush/stumps.  The next few moments all kind of fade together so I will try to type them out as clear as possible without the cursing involved.  I was sitting in the middle seat and I saw a flash of HUGE eyes first in the headlights. By this time I had said ""holy **** look at that"" and D. I. had stopped the truck and opened his door and gotten out because whatever it was was at about a 35 deg angle on the left side not even 100 yrds away from us and my boyfriend sitting on my right had no clue what was going on.  Let me just say that both boys I was with have done lots of hunting and are familiar with animal reactions and their sizes/eye shape, etc.  I am still sitting in the middle of the seat and my boyfriend has gotten out now too and I am FROZEN in fear.  I feel like 5 minutes go by that I am staring in to the largest greenish glowing eyes I have ever seen. I felt like time literally stopped.  D. I. with his door open to my left is so shooken up that he cannot even get the bullet into the shotgon, or even hold it.  All of the sudden my boyfriend said I started shrieking and screaming, and I felt like I was snapped out of a trance and I saw its outline.  What sticks out the most besides the eyes was huge forearms that it seemed to be proping itself up on. I didn't notice color.  It was atleast 700/750lbs.  I kept screaming and now crying(I never even knew I was) and both boys jumped back into the truck, my boyfriend was still wondering what D. I. and I had both saw. My nose started gushing blood (the first nosebleed I've had in many years) and I don't know if it was from the absolute terror of the moment. The thing didn't move the whole time which is so strange even for a bear or elk in the headlights.  We drove off and it RAN up the hillside that was slanted up to the left. The next hour in the truck was so weird and D. I. didn't want to talk at all about it. All he would say over and over was ""that was huge, the eyes, huge..""  We all wanted to get the hell out of the woods. The next day he came over.  He said one really weird thing was he woke up with a nose bleed and he hadn't had one in many years too. We talked more about it and it kept getting more strange to him.  He is the type of person who talks himself out of things like this to not seem like a pussy.  I am not the type of girl that gets scared easily. I never scream or cry I have grown up camping and backpacking in the woods and have seen many animals.

Up ahead at a distance of around an 1/8 mile I saw something in the road that at first glance I made out to be a bear standing upright. I carry my mobile phone that has a camera. I grabbed it hoping to get a pic of a bear. As I approached, the ""bear"" walked upright to the side of the road. By the time I approached the spot where I had seen the object on the road it was just on the side and starting into the brush. It had just stepped off  the side of the gravel shoulder as I snapped the picture. I was approximately 30 yards or so away. I really don't know for sure what I witnessed, but I will say this, I have seen bear, elk, deer, all kinds of wildlife around this area. I drive it daily. This was NOT bear, elk, deer, etc. Whatever this was I had never seen before and it was BIG. I have explained to people that I am a skeptic, but after this I have had a little change of heart. I really do not rattle easily, I am a big ornery biker type that rides a Harley and usually will be the first to call B.S., but this was different.

I quickly reached for my 'ready to shoot' camera, with its 70-300mm tele-lens, but by the time I aimed the camera at that spot...the head/shoulder shape was no longer 'there'.  I told my husband what I'd just seen...but he didn't seem too impressed. So, I stepped out of our SUV to shoot some photos looking downhill and out over the beach below our rather high vantage point.  I shot several, including some of wildflowers blooming nearby my husband's driver-side door.  When I was about to walk back around the car to get into it...a sudden loud noise struck nearby.  I immediately looked toward the wide-metal guard-rail, since the loud noise sounded like a heavy stone hitting metal...leaving a vibrating sound. I saw no stones on the paved parking area...but a stone could have skipped over into the grass and brush just beyond the railing. I don't know what caused that loud noise...but it was unnerving enough for my husband, who does have a hearing problem, to suddenly tell me to get back into the car.  He had heard it also. While first parked in that area...we had also seen a large pickup truck suddenly stop just below us right on the curve of the highway...while it was traveling north, as had we been just minutes earlier.  The truck was not sitting in a safe place...it we noted that it made no sense for it to stop in such a blind-spot on a curved in a busy roadway...  The truck had then moved forward 20 to 30 ft. and then suddenly stopped a second time...and hesitated for several seconds before starting on its way once more.  Later...my husband and I speculated that the truck might also have been struck by a rock/stone thrown from that same hillside... Our rock incident was the second one I know of that occurred within the same week...  I had been told about and shown the broken windshield on a lady's car just days earlier...when a rock had been hurled up, over and out of heavy brush while she drove alone to Aberdeen, Wa from Ocean Shores...passing a swampy area near the Humptulips River.

"My wife and I exited our house at approx 4:30 A.M. through the electric garage door. We each had a dog on a lease and were proceeding to the road to walk the dogs. I live in a private community on Whidbey Island, WA, about 10 miles south of Oak Harbor, in Island County. The area is heavily wooded, and there are no residents on the opposite side of the road from our house. Immediately upon exiting the garage to the short driveway leading to the road, we encountered a very powerful smell. The smell was like something had died and decomposed. Upon entering the road we heard a very loud call, half animal and partial human in nature. It came from directly across the road in the edge of the woods. A second call came from our side of the road, but further down the road. That call came from the woods at the edge of my property. It was an identical call, but it seemed to be a smaller animal. The two creatures communicated for about three minutes using various tones in the calls. My wife and I became fearful and the dogs were frozen in their tracks. We decided to go back in the house. I finished getting ready for work and came back outside at 5:30 A.M. The smell we had encountered was completely gone and there were no more mysterious calls.

"I was traveling west on highway 104. I was traveling for work and headed toward Port Angeles. Traffic was very light as usual on this stretch of road. I had just crested a hill and spotted a car approaching from the west. It was a dark blue VW Rabbit or Golf.

A creature appeared from the southern roadside and proceeded to walk across the highway and leave to the north. It was covered in reddish brown fur/hair and appeared to be about six foot tall.

"This may be just a small thing, but if it helps you tie anything together, then it's probably worth it for me to share this.  First, I must say that I am not easily taken to believing ""out there"" kinds of stories, but I feel I can explain most things in my environment while other things simply put, defy explanation.  I lived in a 22 ft. travel trailer in the woods just outside of Port Townsend, Washington at the time, which - for this report I will say roughly - was about summer 1998 or so.  It was long after dark and I  was inside writing or something and heard a strange bellowing noise just off through the woods.  It was so different than anything I'd ever heard since I moved there a year or so before that I got up and opened the door and stepped out onto the open porch.  It was a clear and still night and out in the country there it is very dark and very quiet.  I could see the stars so well.  When I heard it the second time I was immediately perplexed by what I was hearing, followed by the kind of sensation where they say ""the hairs on the back of my neck stood up"".  It sounded like a call from a large beast.  I study music technology and am well familiar with timbre, frequency, and volume and I can honestly say that the type of voice mechanism and size of it's vocal chords/chest cavity had to be at least the size of a large buck to an elk or bear.  I am also a long time, studied and experienced singer.  I do very well at imitating voices and I was struck by this bellowing as being from not only a large animal, but also an animal which must be nocturnal AND trying to communicate.  But with what or who?  So, I only heard the two bellows and after waiting a few minutes, I decided to get a flashlight and walk up the dirt road where the noise was coming from.  I didn't find anything, but I did hear other voices through the woods in the vacinity from which the noise came and I recognized them as coming from a nearby yurt, just on the other side of a small lake from me.  It was in comparison of these voices that I determined that the crys I initially heard were coming from a distance of about 100 to 150 yards.  The only other thing I should mention about the instance is that I lived on the edge of a green belt that runs, unbroken, from Port Townsend city limits, all the way into the Olympic National Park.  Furthermore, my good friend, Todd, living on the same green belt was sleeping outside one night and heard a creature of large size come lumbering up, sticks cracking and brush sweeping and all, and get very close to where he was in a tree- loft, then sat quiet for several minutes before crashing off through the brush, the way it had come. Please understand, I have hiked the deep Olympic Mts. avidly for 12 years.  I've even worked out there at times, and I've never heard anything like the bellowing I heard that night.  And at the risk of sounding cliche or hoaky, that voicing sounded more like wookie, without the rattling throat sound that any other known sound.  But it's true also that after years of hiking and tracking in the mountains, I've never seen a bear or cougar, nor their remains and though I know they are out there, I have only but chanced to stumble upon a fresh cougar den along the Lyre River but nary a single cat in sight. Call it what you will, I say had a sasquatch experience and some of my trusted friends can report similar strange occurances.  Bigfoot, Sasquatch, Browns and Blacks, whatever they call them out here, they're real.  And researcher Grover Crantz recently moved 35 minutes down the road from here in Sequim.  So ""something's"" up, anyway.","Traveling into Port Townsend on State Route 20, you pass a sign that says ""P.T. 4 miles"".  A mile or so later you come to a left turn onto Jacob Miller Rd.  You follow that for a few miles, passing the county landfill, and you come to Hastings Rd.  You turn right, and less than a mile later, you turn left on Cook Av.  perhaps half a mile later you round a curve and find Elmira Rd.  On the left.  This is the general vacinity from which the bellowing came from.  The location of the friend's occurance would be the same turn onto Jacob Miller, but then a quick left onto Old Discovery Rd. and taking, I believe, the second right onto Arcadia Rd - then a quick left down this dirt road which I think is unmarked except for red fire markers.

"I was about 13 or 14 at the time, and went with a group of church kids on a hike up into the Olympic Mountains. There were about 10 kids and 4 adults leaders. We hiked up the Dosewallips River headwaters to the Royal Basin where there are a couple of small lakes. We made camp and eat dinner then went to bed. The adults stayed near the campfire area. One group slep under a large rock overhang. I chose to sleep a little away from all their noise of the others. I remember looking up at the stars and the jagged mountains. After a while I looked up again and saw that the mountains appeared smooth! I was thinking, how could this be, when the ""smooth"" mountain started to sway a little. I smelled a definite skunk cabbage smell. I then realized that this was not the mountain but the silouette of a large animal. I was seeing its head and shoulders as it was standing at the foot of my sleeping bag. I pulled the sleeping bag up over my head. Later I looked out and it was gone. The mountain was back to its normal jagged shape. Then the group down by the overhang rock started yelling. ""Whats that over there?"" ""It looks like a big gorilla!"" ""Look you can see it, its moving!"" The adults were upset at all the talking and screaming. I heard each of the adults in turn saying to knock it off and get back to sleep! Not one of the adults could have been pulling a prank. They were all off to the lake side as I could hear. The next morning there was a lot of talk of what they saw the night before. The adults thought the older kids were just trying to scare the younger ones. I think they were telling the truth.","Headwatters of Dosewallips River, Royal Basin near the largest lake and rock overhang in the medow.",Jefferson County,Washington,Spring,Report 5299: Camping group has night time sighting near the Dosewallips River,47.8306,-123.2135,10/13/2004,5299,Class A,c282h5q9mq,54.24,48.485,42.73,45.57,1,0.02,0.98,0,0,,1028.54,Clear throughout the day.,3,10,6,1
"This happened during the October 2004 Washington BFRO Expedition on the Olympic Penninsula. It was the first night of the expedition and my brother and I had been asked (as well as two other team members) to go to a location that had a recent sighting reported by [a local law enforcement officer]. The objective for the night was to walk a portion of the mountain road while making occasional wood knocks with hopes of attracting a sasquatch. By the time we arrived at the location and prepared all of our gear it had become completely dark.  We started walking down the mountain road.  After about 5 minutes of walking we heard two short grunting sounds that came from the woods to our left (south of the road).  The grunting noises were very deep sounding, had some power behind them. There were a few moments of silence and blank stares between us. We continued down the road, wondering if the thing would make more noise. We continued doing wood knocks as we walked. A few hours passed as we continued to walk up and down the 3/4 mile stretch of the road, knocking every 20-30 minutes.  Then we were contacted by radio from another team that was positioned approximately 3-5 miles from us along the banks of [a river]. The river team had apparently been hearing wood knocks coming from somewhere between their location and our location. They wanted to check if it was our wood knocks they were hearing. To see whether the river team could hear our wood knocks, we made some loud knocks and asked if the river team could hear us. The river team asked us to repeat the knocks a few times. After a few tries they said they were not able to hear our knocks at all, so whatever they were hearing was closer to them. We continued back up the road.  Not longer after climbing back up the road we heard what I could only describe as a scream that came from the southwest of us, approximately 250 - 300 yards in the woods. The ""scream"" started as a low, deep moan and went into a very high pitched screech lasting at least a few seconds.  It was very unlike anything we had ever heard. We were shocked because we had hunted in the Pacific Northwest for years and knew every kind of large animal sound. Several minutes of silence went by and we decided to proceed up the road further to where the truck was parked.  After reaching the truck we unloaded some of our equipment. We were ready to start heading back down the road again when we heard the second scream. This time the scream was much closer, within 50 yards of us and on the opposite side of the road from the first scream.  The scream again started as a low moan and reached a very high pitched screech.  The volume and power of the scream was amazing, it made every hair stand on end.  The scream probably lasted a few seconds, but was so loud that I was expecting this animal to come through the trees at any moment. All four stood there in complete shock at what we had just heard.  We eventually gathered ourselves and continued walking up and down the road for a period of time, wondering what was going to happen next. Nothing further happened that evening. My brother and I are experienced outdoorsmen.  We have spent most of our lives in the woods in and around the Pacific Northwest.  We both are very familiar with the calls and sounds of all of the known animal species in the area, especially elk, deer and bear.  The screams we experienced were not any animal that either of us, or any of the others in our team, had ever heard before. If any of us had heard something like this before we sure would not have forgotten it. We'll definitely remember what we heard on this trip.",[Details removed],Jefferson County,Washington,Fall,Report 11040: Vocalizations heard by expeditioners on Olympic Peninsula.,47.5532,-124.3324,10/21/2004,11040,Class B,c0rwd8zcmn,52.9,50.965,49.03,43.66,0.78,0.72,0.28,0.0003,0.82,rain,1009.48,Light rain overnight.,2,9.12,209,3.09
"We were on the Spruce Trail in the Hoh Rainforest when we came across this track (I attached the picture). To provide some size reference I put my foot next to the track. My boot is a size 11.5 (wide). It's a Vasque boot and I'm sure the dimensions are available online. Anyways, my boot was slightly smaller than the track (maybe 1/2 inch). The trail was full of Elk tracks as well. Adult Elk and baby Elk tracks were present everywhere and signs were posted about the Elk. There are many game trails that crisscross these hiking trails. Later on we continued on the trail and we came across another foot print that was slightly smaller but it had been stepped on by someone and it was only a partial print. Here are some details I gathered from my observation that day.  The track in the picture appeared to be about two days old in my opinion. I weigh 210 lbs, I'm 6""1 and my boot size is a size 11.5 (wide). The track had to be an inch and a half deep. I stood on one leg and pushed very hard and I didn't leave nearly (maybe a 1/4 inch) as deap of a track. Granted the moisture level may have changed in the mud causing more resistance. Also noted was the outer edge of the print and how much mud had been displaced. I also saw sharp nail marks on the toes and some say they can see it in the photo I attached. I noticed them because earlier in the day I saw a cougar track at another location and the nail marks seemed similar. I can tell by the way the toes are slanted, the depth, and the arch that this is likely not a fake print. I couldn't see any dermal ridges in the track.",The Spruce Trail from the Hoh Visitors center.,Jefferson County,Washington,Spring,Report 12098: Hoh Rain Forest print photographed,47.86028,-123.9364,9/15/2005,12098,Class B,c0xb7b8q2d,61.18,55.445,49.71,44.53,0.67,0.66,0.41,0,0,,1018.03,Mostly cloudy throughout the day.,4,9.75,260,1.52
"I am submitting this is response to report #12098.  In August 0f 2001, when my wife and I still lived in Florida, we made a trip out to WA and visited the Hoh rainforest.  We hiked up a well-traveled trail--possibly the Spruce Trail--and came upon a footprint of which I still have a picture.  It was a bare human-like footprint about 11-12 inches long.  Given (a) the modest size of the footprint, (b) the popular nature of the trail and (c) the fact that there were many ""hippy"" types in the area, I assumed it was just a very casual hiker.  But I took a picture anyway, with my boot for comparison. Upon seeing the picture in report #12098, I dug out my picture and was struck by the similarity.  Having lived in WA a few years now and having become better acquainted with what are purported to be genuine sasquatch footprints, I took note of the squared-off toes and the medially-leaning big toe.  In the picture, just above the toe of my right boot, one can see a print I made, which barely sunk in at all compared to the print in question (though moisture levels may have varied). I don't remember much about that day beyond the huge trees.  The rest of that film roll is my wife posing beside big, buttressed trunks.  There were other people on the trail that day, which, to me, made it unlikely that a sasquatch had been hanging out there, though I suppose the print could've been made at night.  Given the traffic on the trail, however, I would've expected it to have been obliterated already.  Perhaps other people were noticing it and stepping around it too.  If I'm not mistaken, there was another less distinct track down (or up) the trail, but I can't be certain.  I've never heard of bigfoot tracks on hiking trails, which was another reason I dismissed the track.  Another possibility is a hoaxer, though you'd think they'd go for something more dramatic and attention-grabbing, like a 16 inch print. The picture was on a normal camera, so I can't put it on the computer.  Please let me know if you'd like me to send it in.  If it is a genuine print, I'm wondering if it's the same individual from report #12098.",,Jefferson County,Washington,Summer,"Report 12844: Hiker photographs track on trail in Hoh River rainforest, on the Olympic Peninsula",47.86697,-123.8796,2/23/2006,12844,Class B,c0xbm1ctk1,42.16,34.65,27.14,30.94,0.75,0.59,0.84,0.0068,1,rain,1019.92,Mixed precipitation in the morning and afternoon.,3,9.33,258,2.01
"After I read several articles of experiences I feel I should tell my story... In 1983 I lived in an old cabin off of Chicken Coop Road and Highway 1 near Sequim. The cabin was very remote and there was a 200 acre tract behind us that was second growth forest and very lush. I remember the 4 to 5' ferns and very large trees. The outhouse was about 100' from the house and across a stream. When I walked out the door I untied my Rottweiler/Doberman mix so she could walk with me. She was a very protective dog and I always felt safe with her around. Well she immediately ran under the cabin and refused to come out. Then I heard the crashing through the small alders on my left and it sounded BIG. I immediately ran back into the cabin and got my husband. He ran out the front door and heard the crashing through the trees. Needless to say, I slept with a wooden baseball bat and my husband slept with a machete since we didn't have anything else. That next morning we investigated the area we heard the sounds from. The grove of small 4"" alders that grew in that draw were broken off about 4' up from the bases of the trees. We found no tracks but there was a clear trail through that stand of trees. I don't what it was but I've been in the mountains most of my life and I'm familiar with most of the woodland creatures. I've never been so scared in my life and after 25 years and I remember very clearly as if it was yesterday.

"My encounter took place along the white river,we were out hiking, the sun had gone down and we began hiking back under the moonlight, which had illuminated the trails nicely. As we walked down the trails through the woods I occationally heard the sounds of twigs and branches breaking as if somthing was moving through the trees and bushes about 10-15 feet off the side of the trail. I became greatly alarmed because whatever was creating the disturbance had been following us for quite a distance as i began paying more attention to the sounds of branches breaking i could hear that they were footstepts, just like the ones a human would make walking through the brush, i knew in my heart that it was a bipeadal creature at that point. still, we kept going but now i began to feel little bits of sticks and pebbles being thrown at me, as i turned my head to look behind me i saw a piece of stick come flying right at me from the bushes. at that same point my friend also turned and yelled at me to stop throwing stuff at him, i told him it was not me and i told him that whatever was throwning stuff was just beyond our sight off the side of the trail. we were all very scared. we stopped to rest along the river bank near the end of the trail, as we sat quietly i heard a low bass toned growl. judging from the sound it had to be a large creature, possibly a bear, but is a bear capable of walking on two feet for such an incredible distace and is a bear able to throw bits of sticks and pebbles with its paw? its from these facts that i belive we were stalked by a bigfoot.",the white river is glacier runoff surounded by pine trees,King County,Washington,Spring,Report 12138: Hikers report possible stalking and rock/stick throwing in White River drainage near Muckleshoot Reservation,47.275,-122.195,5/1/2002,12138,Class B,c23hgqhkf4,53.16,49.57,45.98,43.78,0.81,0.82,0.67,0,0,,1019,Overcast throughout the day.,4,9.51,200,7.84

I had an experience in 1984 which closely resembles the report filed # 1385. Their report evidensed hearing a very loud scream...etc. Back in August of 1984 I was camping above the Alpental Ski resort at an alpine lake I believe is referred to as Snow Lake (not certain this is the correct name however). It is a fairly exhaustive hike with substantial elevation gain and mileage from the trailhead. I took my brothers black lab for companionship and we found a spot at the lake near the trail. As I was setting up camp that evening I met a young couple that stopped briefly to ask for camp site reccomendations..As I recall we were the only people up there that evening. As night progressed it got dark and fairly cold..I had a camp fire going and could see the other site a few hundred yards down the lakeside. At approximately 10:00 PM that evening I saw my lab sniff the air and get extremely irritated as if another dog were in the area. Within seconds the dog was up and pacing the campsite and acting very nervous (hairs were stanging on his back). At that same time I heard a very loud scream that was high pitched but also changed octives to a low gutteral roar at the end. This sound continued for at least a couple of minutes and then nothing was heard after. I realize that a lake can carry sound fairly well but this noise sounded as if it were literally just outside my camp. The following morning I got up and stirred the fire. Around 6:00 AM the same couple that I met that previous night came up to me to ask if I had heard the sound. I admitted that I heard something I couldnt describe other than a loud scream-roar. The people then described to me that they heard it right outside their campsite. As they described their experience they mentioned that the creature was passing near their site and making the sound.They could actually hear tree branches snapping outside their camp. The couple indicated to me that the 'animal' was pacing around their camp for a few minutes while it was wailing and roaring. These people were most certainly scared by something that evening..as was I.Apparently they had'nt slept the entire night and it looked like it to me. They appeared emotionally and physically exhausted to me. They never gave their name but they made the effort to come to me and inform that they were leaving immediately and I would be 'solo' up on the lake. I realize that there are several animals in the northwest that make various noises..mountain lions for example. This noise was nothing like I've ever heard. I have sampled the audio recordings you have on your site but they dont compare to what I heard. The screams are very similar but there was most certainly a change of octive as I described to a low roar. If instinct tells me anything this was a territorial 'notice' or noise...needless to say I left not long after the couple and havent returned since. I would actually like to exchange any information on audio experiences similar to mine for that area. Feel free to post this if you deem it appropriate. I always wondered if that same couple may have posted their experience.

"I had gone up to Tinkham for a solo camp before spending 5 days in Utah visiting my father.  I've given these whistling sounds alot of thought, as two of the three sounded entirely not like any bird I've ever heard - more like a person would whistle, really, only pretty loud, but flat and smooth. The third sounded more like a bird, but the last of its three notes would reverberate all over itself - a piercing note that echoed fairly intensely after termination. (Maybe two weeks earlier, I heard the same sound in the Upper Cle Elum River valley, up on a slope going east away from Tucquala Meadows, coming from several individuals, which I assumed were some kind of bird I'd never heard before.  But, then again, I've heard WHOOPING in the same approximate location before, only to write those off, too, as some kind of bird I've never heard before.)  The first two, flat-toned, human-like whistles (but with more ""air"" behind them - far ""richer"") were to my northeast and east.  The northeast whistle was noticeably stronger and sounded like it was getting closer.  The east whistle sounded like it moved a little closer and towards the road (south), when the third whistle began.  For about maybe 15 seconds it sounded like they were going back and forth.  Then it just stopped, and all went absolutely quiet again, save for a ground-branch snap to the east immediately after it ended. I tried to ignore the nature of the whistles as best as I could but an occasional branch being crunched on the ground kept me on edge for about the next hour.  I didn't feel alone, but didn't feel threatened either.  I even slept in the back of my truck, under the trees. The whistling described in report #1674 spurned me to share this.  Because ""trying to sound like birds"" crossed my mind while hearing the first two whistlings, and I've heard none of these ""bird sounds"" before. What gets me is that on the Upper Cle Elum I was whistling back and forth with a single because I thought the way it ended was extremely impressive (piercing).  I was fascinated by how far and fast the end-note was pushed through the air by its maker.  Then a couple more joined in, with one sounding to be a good couple-hundred yards in the woods, and a couple hundred feet up the slope, but it was still plenty loud. Hell, maybe they were birds, and maybe the last one to join in at Tinkham was a bird, too, but the other two in no way sounded like a bird, hawk, eagle, owl or anything.  This leads me to believe these all weren't bird sounds. In fact, I had no inclination to try whistling back at Tinkham whatsoever.  The first two whistles had me very much ""on alert"".","Approximately 1.5 miles east of Tinkham Campground, but still west of Hansen Creek.

"I have read most of your reports that cover the West Coast states. I have yet to see it mentioned but, a friend of mine that has read numerous reports on both your site and others told me that one type of B class reports deals with hearing a thumping sound like a padded baseball bat hitting a large tree trunk very rapidly. I need to know if this is evidence of proximity to the Sasquatch. I live just outside the old Weyerhauser Tree Farm in Snoqualmie Valley and spend alot of time taking early morning walks there with my dog to take pictures. One morning I had hiked in about 1.5 miles off a logging road to a swamp that was partially exposed by logging and was sitting for about 20 minutes on the ground up from the edge of the swamp in the bushes waiting for the frogs to start up again when on the hillside across the swamp from me I first heard thumping. It was rapid short duration and deep. There was no more than 5 or 6 knocks. The sound was much deeper than the sounds made by woodpeckers, I have heard and seen these too while out there walking. The tree thumps are very rapid, I couldn’t knock that fast one handed at all with something heavy enough to make that sound. The sound is also much fuller bodied than knocking a dead branch against a tree branch; the sound is more like if 4 people were to hit a hollow trunk in fairly quick succession 1 1/2 to 2 times. This first thumping was followed shortly by a second simular series of resonant thumps about 250 yrds from the first on the same side of the hill. This thumping was closely followed by 2 short calls coming from each original thumping source areas repectively on the hillside. The calls were one constant sound for a short duration, one call and then from the other location exactly the same sound. They sounded like a howler monkey in hollowness and pitch. There used to be howler monkeys just in the entrance of the San Diego Zoo of which I used to have a yearly membership. Like the thumping it was a sound that traveled far. The other location where I heard the thumping was right outside the Chester Morse watershed which is off limits. I was again out hiking in the early morning with my dog for picture taking. No vocalizations this time, just the same rapid patting of a tree trunk. I can't stress enough that this isn't woodpeckers, I do know that sound. The speed of the contacts wasn't as fast as a woodpecker. I guess my question is does this ""thumping"" show up before in your experience proximity of the animals? I know you're very busy but, I just need to know if any one else has reported hearing sounds like this or if you know what I am hearing?",First incident was in the Weyerhauser Tree Farm outside of Snoqualmie just off the county road that runs thru it.

"Hello, I grew up in the Sierra Nevada mountains (Lake Tahoe).  I am an avid outdoorsman that has hiked from Mexico to Canada.  I have always believed that there is bigfoots running around. I now live in Seattle and go to the Cascades to fly fish on a very regular basis. A couple years ago I was fishing a little creek that is a trib to the Middle fork of the Snoqualmie. As I approached the creek I saw a large footprint.  The hair on my neck stood up.  I looked at the other side of the creek and their was another large track.  Not bear, not lion- like nothing I have seen before or since. I got a little spooked because the tracks looked quite fresh.  As I broke back through the alder on the way back to the car I sensed something looking at me.  Very scary, like I was being followed.  I got within 30 feet of my ride and heard breathing coming behind me but no footsteps.  I jumped in and sped away.  I was very spooked.  I would be willing to show an expert where I saw the prints.  I will not go back their on my own.  Not that it would hurt me, but more that it was an ominous presence.

"Observation: vocalizations. Hello, I am now 48, and my dad was a telegrapher during the 1960's at the former depot at Scenic.  I used to greatly enjoy spending a week at a time at Scenic with him while he was on duty, staying in his trailer near the depot, and it was a wonderful place for a young railroad enthusiast to grow up.  In later years I started an annual tradition of camping at Scenic and spending several days picking huckleberries on Tonga Ridge. On August 24, I had finished picking berries for the day and had returned to Scenic to a little, mostly forgotten camping spot just inside the edge of a dark old-growth forest.  The southern hillside becomes somewhat steep a short distance away.  It was dusk, I was setting up to cook some dinner, and had my Coleman light burning.  A few minutes before this, two or more men in two BNSF vehicles had parked next to the tracks waiting for an eastbound freight to arrive which was having engine trouble coming up the hill (knew this from my scanner).  I could hear them talking in their vehicles.  Suddenly, from what seemed to come from up above the hillside, there was a bizarre two-second-long very loud ascending-frequency swooping cry.  I have perfect pitch so I can tell you it started around 500 Hz and went up to about 800 Hz.  This was followed by  three or four bizarre shrieks of some sort, a little higher, which almost sounded like some kind of goofy laughter, but... I had not read anything seriously about Sasquatch for many years, and had not then ever heard a recording of one, so these sounds did not make any sense.  The only possibility, I thought, was that some practical joker was up there, had seen my camplight, and was trying to spook me.  But there were no other vehicles that I knew of, and there was no reason for anyone to BE up there on that hillside above a forgotten campground.  The intensity of the calls did not make sense, either.  I doubt if a human could have made a call that loud. I went about my business, but as I sat there eating dinner with the light burning I had this very odd feeling that something was watching me.  (I know how silly this all sounds.)  I slept in the car as planned (doors locked).  Next night, camped near the Cascade Tunnel west portal.  On the night of the 26th, camped at the first location again.  Heard nothing, but had that same creepy feeling that something up above was watching everything.  I thought about walking up that hillside to a familiar old waterfall on Surprise Creek, but something told me, ""Not this time."" As a Christian, I do believe in angelic protection, but after reading dozens of encounter stories in the last couple days, and reading Judy Walter's story from 1970 just tonight, and hearing the audio clips, I don't feel at ease about camping there anymore, unless I do it at the other side of the tracks under the night lights! The difference between what I heard and most of the audio files I have heard: the latter have sounded mostly like ghastly shrieks out of some horror movie.  This was more of a pure tone at first, then the following sounds had other frequencies mixed in.  A very intense sound. I have a question about animal scat.  While picking berries on Tonga Ridge on the 27th, I walked about a thousand feet northwest of the road where people never go, through the trees and brush, looking for a better berry spot, and saw a pile of what I thought was bear scat in an open place.  Now I'm not so sure that's what it was.  It looked similar to human, but about two inches diameter; broken in many segments; well defined, as though not having a high moisture content when deposited, and was black & grey with much fiber content; probably several days old.  I note this because you have another story in this collection about someone seeing the creature on a Foss River forest road, which is the one I go up to get to Tonga Ridge, on F.S. 6830. I'm also wondering now if those skunky smells I encounter now and then while driving across the mountains late at night are always skunk.  ???","Forested campsite  Scenic, WA.",King County,Washington,Summer,Report 12510: Vocalizations near Scenic interrupt a camper’s quiet evening,47.71167,-121.1544,9/12/2005,12510,Class B,c23z7jdh9g,61.24,52.2,43.16,45.75,0.82,,0.3,0,0,,,Clear throughout the day.,0,,325,0.5
"I was lying in bed, trying to go to sleep, when I heard an unusual sound from outside through my partly-opened window.  It sounded like a cross between a person moaning, a dog howling, and a cat growling (the timbre was human-like and in human vocal range, it was a high-to-low pitch sound like a howl, and there was a hint of growliness underneath that sounded like an angry cat, but much larger).  It sounded almost like someone moaning ""booooooo"".  The ""b"" sound was faint, but definitely present.  Each vocalization was about 5-6 seconds in length, with about 5 seconds between each.  It didn't seem very loud, but it also was not faint. I listened for several seconds, then got out of bed to peek out the window.  My front yard is well-lit by a streetlight, but I didn't see anything.  I have very bad eyesight, though, so after looking and listening for a minute and seeing nothing obvious, I went to get my glasses.  I noticed my cat was staring at the window very intently, not moving.  Normally when he hears a noise outside he will ignore it, glance over casually, or watch intently with his tail switching.  He didn't move a muscle. I looked out the window, through the blinds, with my glasses on but still saw nothing.  Being very familiar with the noises of dogs, cats, and coyotes (howling, fighting, mating, growling, etc.), I was spooked when I could not place the sound.  The next day I also looked up sounds for different types of owls, bears, and large cats--no matches. I went to my parents' bedroom to wake up my mom.  My bedroom is at the front of the house, and theirs is at the back (both on the 2nd floor).  I was shocked to hear the noise just as clearly from their room, echoing around the neighborhood.  From my room it just didn't seem that loud.  This makes me wonder if whatever was making the noise was really at the front of the house, or if it was elsewhere in the neighborhood and the sound carried. By the time I awakened my mom I had been hearing the sound for about 4-5 minutes, at fairly regular intervals of no more than 10 seconds.  When she got up I told her to listen to the noise and asked her to come to my room (since I still thought the creature might be visible from my window).  She went to the window and quickly pulled up the blinds and opened the window (which made quite a bit of racket).  We saw nothing, and the noise immediately stopped.  I never heard it again that night, or any night after. It was somewhat simliar to the Mississippi recording.  If my neighborhood were in a more sparsely populated area, I would probably be much more certain of the possibility that it was a sasquatch.","Neighborhood is near Marymoor Park (640 acre county park), which is linked by sparsely populated, wooded areas to the Cascade foothills about 10 miles away.",King County,Washington,Fall,Report 17847: Possible late night vocalizations heard outside Redmond,47.6597,-122.105,10/12/2005,17847,Class B,c23pjkjvgk,57.53,54.685,51.84,47.54,0.79,0.74,0.33,0.0019,1,rain,1019.24,Mostly cloudy throughout the day.,2,10,160,2.08
"I was walking my dogs in Marymoor Park, near Redmond, WA.  It was in the early-to mid-afternoon. The park was predominantly empty and quiet, and despite recent rain, the paths were not overly muddy.  It was a sort of hazy day, with some sun, probably 50-60 degrees. We had followed a somewhat under-utilized trail/road that parallels Hwy 520, going from the velodrome down to the Sammamish River.  It is a grassy area with occasional brush.  The trail makes a T-junction at the Sammamish River bank.  One can turn right and go under Hwy 520 to Redmond Town Center shopping district, or turn left and remain in Marymoor Park. Just at the bank of the Sammamish River, there is a stand of brambles that create large mounds on both sides of the trail on the Marymoor side of Hwy 520.  This little bramble forest is probably about 30 yards long.   The Sammamish River travels along the west edge of the park, emptying into Lake Sammamish about 1/4 mile away (or slightly more?), in the park.  (Salmon run this river in October/November.) We turned left and were walking through the brambles, parallel to the Sammamish River, heading into the park and away from Hwy 520. Just as we were at the end of the bramble mounds, and emerging into a clearing area, to my right, from the river bank, there arose a hair-raising screeching howly yowling sound, like something terrified and screaming. It did not sound human and was quite long-winded/sustained. I stopped and stood very still.  I was chilled to the bone by the sound, the hair standing up on my body.  One dog looked towards the river, his fur also standing on end and the other cowered a bit, her tail down. The sound was coming from within about 50 yards of us, but I could not see anything or anyone along the river bank.  There is brush and trees there, so they were blocking my view of some areas of the river bank. The W. Sammamish Parkway is across the river and parallel to the river and the trail I was on.  The cars travelling along that road create a certain roar as do the ones on Hwy 520.  Whatever this yowling sound was, it was super audible above the sound of traffic on both these busy roads. After a minute, we began walking again, and the sound arose again.  This time, it was further away, maybe 75 yards up the river.  This time, the yowling sound was followed by knocking sounds of wood on wood.  At this point, I did go to the edge of the river and look up the river bank to see if I could catch a glimpse of whoever or whatever was making the noise, but I could not see anyone or anything there.  I wondered if it was people goofing around, but I did not see anyone or hear people sounds. A few minutes later, I heard knocking, again, but no yowling.  It was probably from the area just below an old non-functioning windmill that stands on the banks of the Sammamish River, near the west entrance & bridge into the park. When we reached the main bridge that comes into the park from the Sammamish Parkway (close to the windmill), we turned east, towards the Clise Mansion and park facilities area, and were no longer walking along the river.  I did not hear any other yowling sounds after that.  Also, from that vantage point (the bridge), I could not see anyone or anything along the river. About 15 minutes later, when I drove out of the park, I again stopped near the bridge to look up and down the river, but saw nothing and no one.","Marymoor Park is a fairly large park that used to be a farm.  It is on the edge of Lake Sammamish and is bordered by the Sammamish River on the west.  Part of the park is open grassland, some is forested by pines and flowering trees, and part of it is swampy terrain, especially along the lake edges.  There are several large brambled areas.  There are intermittant stands of brush throughout the park, a community farm, a pet cemetery, large off-leash areas, sporting grounds (cricket, baseball, soccer, tennis),an auditorium, a velodrome, and a house/museum.

"My wife and I just returned from a trip out to Seattle via Amtrak. We took the ‘Empire Builder’ out of Chicago, all the way to Seattle. On the morning of Tuesday, August 4th, around 8:00am, I was sitting in our ‘sleeper compartment’, on the port side of the train as it exited the long, Cascade Tunnel. I was just relaxing with my head back against the seat, looking out the window, letting the scenery pass by. The train was moving about 40mph and the landscape rose sharply up the mountain. (I was facing toward the rear of the train.)  About a mile west of the tunnel exit, I suddenly glimpsed a ‘huge’ figure, standing in the trees, up the grade about 50 to 75 feet from the train!! The woods were quite dense and I only saw the figure for a brief moment but it was unmistakably a Bigfoot!! He, (it) was standing on the sharp incline, looking down at the train, with his right hand on an Aspen tree!! (Because of the speed of the train, I only glimpsed it but I’m positive of what I saw!!!!)  The area seemed to be very remote, desolate and wild!! A minute or two later, the landscape dropped off into a steep canyon where I could view the Skokomish river below. It looked to be full of large boulders and the flow was quite rapid and steep.  The Empire Builder passes this same spot daily. It occurs to me that this animal might have developed some curiosity with the train and may visit the spot quite often. It was quite a shock to glimpse him!!! Quite a thrill as well!! Of course, I exclaimed to my wife immediately.

"I have worked as a wilderness guide for about eight years, many of which where spent in Katmai National Park and the Yukon delta. So it's fair to say I know what lives in the woods, and the behavior of the woods. I will make my story brief. My experience happened in Washington state, mid summer back in 2003. A close friend and myself decided to go shoot some ground fowl in the Indianola area of Wa. After entering a clearing some 1000ft open, we stopped to smoke a cig. I must note the air was still and damp, and I could smell death of a creature close by.  Some time during the smoke I had movement in the corner of my eye. An animal stood 400 or so ft away from me. I know what a bear looks like, I worked as a Brooks River guide. It was not a bear. It was not a person. I'm 6ft 4. It was much much larger and beefier than me. It was not someone messing around. I was armed. But I can say that animal had a stride not matched in North America. It did walk some 200ft from the left to right in my vision. I was not going to shoot it. I wanted nothing to do with it. Needless to say we exited back to the truck back to back. I have not spoke of this due to the fact it would taint my career as a wilderness guide.

"My Boss and I work in forestry, were in the field allmost every day. We were working in this remote part of a Indian Reservation forested allotment. we were resurveying property lines and getting ready for a timber harvest. well this day we were resurveying the south side of this allotment heading east we were measuring every 100ft for a distance of 1320 ft. at approximate 11:00 a.m we kept hearing something following us eather behind us or our left or right it stayed approximate 100 to 250ft away from us. there was this stench  real heavy oder that we kept smelling near us. I kept blamming my boss that he had crapped in his pants and he kept accusing me of doing the same he said theres only two of us out here and I know I didnt do it. well anyway we were taking a break from hacking through the brush with our machete and we were leaning against this 200 plus old growth blowdown fir tree. I took a cigarette out and lit up, and then there was this branch or twigs breaking like something large walking through the underbrush about a 120ft away. I could not find any rocks to throw in that direction but found a u shaped piece of wood that I throw near the spot where we heard the sounds. ( take note of piece of u shaped wood because in another encounter a few years later and only a couple of months ago I had that same piece thrown at me) it got quite like I said it was cloudy and kinda dark under the tree canopy. the noise came from the other side of this large salmonberry bushes then all of a sudden the clouds broke open and aloud some daylight through behind the bushes about 10ft so that the four creatures that were watching us you could see their shadow. I told my boss mike to take a look in that direction but because of his bad eye sight he could not see that well. there were two realy big adult males one skinny tall female with shoulder lenght hair and she had a bad hump on her back her breast were like a realy old women and she kept ringing her hands together as she was speaking to the other males. there was a child to her left that stood about 6ft tall but was dwarft by the three larger adult creatures. the two males stood still motionless they watched me and did not talk much to the female that was doing most of the talking in her own dialect the males seamed to motion to her to keep quite then the clouds had covered up the rays of light and it got dark again. my boss mike kinda had seen the shadows but tried to convince me it was his boss ken and some secretarys that he brought out into the woods that sometimes he does. right after that they kept following us and my boss mike got spooked and said lets get out of here and come back next week to finnish our survey. AnimalSeen : the animals were almost 8ft except the child was 6ft tall.they were covered in fir or hair except for around there eyes and nose parts of there cheeks. one thing i did notice was i did knot see any ears on there head. the two large males were realy huge large broad shoulders, the female was tall thin with large hump on back between her shoulder blades,her breast saged near her waist.","township26North Range02East,Section#11,willamette Meridian, Kitsap county Washington",Kitsap County,Washington,Summer,Report 7441: Forest worker has many encounters with bigfoot,47.763,-122.5344,11/16/2004,7441,Class A,c22zewvpts,52.65,46.605,40.56,44.86,0.88,0.91,0.16,0.0014,1,rain,1022.14,Mostly cloudy throughout the day.,1,8.83,183,2.98

It walked out of the marsh and seemed to be startled with the girls as it tried to quickly duck behind a large piece of drift wood. It did not run away it continues to watch the girls from a crouched position,poking his head out from the side of the wood. The girls ran to the van and demanded to leave the Beach.

"I wanted to report this now. I should of the first incident I had. This was on a cool morning, Sunday. I remember the day because I work earlier on Sunday's than the rest of the week. It was November, 2007.  I was up a little before 5AM and then let the dog out to do his thing. What I heard when I got outside was alarming. It was a howl or moan coming from some distance away.  My dog doesn't care when he hears other dog's howl or bark, but this got his interest.  I have heard cougar and coyotes howl, that wasn't it. I had heard this sometime ago when I started to research sasquatch, I came across a howl or moan from Westmoreland, PA. It sounded very similar. This is why it creeped me out.  It went on for about 10 minutes, then I had to go back inside to get ready for work.  When I came out again about 30 minutes later it started again, but in short bursts.

"I used to live in Suquamish, WA. during 1994-2002. My house was located at the top of center street in the middle of the suquamish tree farm. My family and I during those years of residency had seen and heard quite a few times what we believed to be sasquatch. The first time I saw one was in early 1995, and I was 8 years old at the time. It was a fairly chilly overcast winter day. We had few neighbors at the time and there was noone outside, so it was very peaceful. My mom had instructed me to pick up some cans from the backyard alone. The backyard was connected to the woods. I was at the edge of the woods and started heading back towards the house when I heard something very large running in the woods about 20 feet away. I quickly turned around to look and I saw what I thought was a bear at first, but it was running on two feet and it stopped quickly as it saw that I turned around. When it stopped, it stood straight up (on two feet like a man), and held its arms and hands close to its side. Ferns were covering parts of its legs. It was about 10 feet from any trees. I got the impression that it was hoping that I didn't see it. As it stood still there, I stared at it for several seconds trying to figure out what it was. It was about 6'5"". It was very muscular, and very hairy except for I did not see hair on the face and on the fingers. Its fur was a dark brown color. To be honest I cannot remember exactly what the skin color was, but I think it was light tan. Its eyes were directed toward me. The facial features were very similar to human features. I remember them being a lot more human than ape-like. Its face was not course and scary! I stared at it for about 10-15 seconds until I finally figured out what it was, and then I bolted back to the house as fast as I could. There was a few more occasions that I have seen a Sasquatch, as well as my mother and my brother. We not only had sightings but almost every night we heard branches being broken in the woods and being hit in patterns, hollars and/or ""woo woo"" vocalizations coming from deep in the woods or close to the edge of the woods near our house. We often heard the ""woo woo"" sound between 2 or 3 sasquatches (I believe). My brother and I had gone out in the woods a lot trying to recreate the ""woo woo"" vocalizations and we would hit sticks on trees in patterns. I can only remember two ocasions that we actually got a response. The first time was when we were in the woods at the edge of our property, and we were beating a stick on a tree in a pattern of 4 strikes each. After doing this for about 20 minutes not very far away from us we heard a very large tree branch being broken off of a tree following by 4 loud strikes on a tree. It responded in with 4 strikes a few times and then it stopped. The other time was when my brother and I were in the yard at about 9 o'clock at night, and it was very dark. Jokingly to my brother I did the ""woo woo"" vocalization, not expecting a response, but about 3 seconds later near the edge of the woods that were infront of our house we heard a  loud and somewhat dragged on ""woo"" .","Center Street is the only road that runs along through all of Suquamish.

I was driving down South Kingston road January 25th on a Tuesday at about 1030pm. After coming around the last turn before the road turns to Miller Bay Road I saw something I will never forget.

"Me my wife and my friend and his wife and two children were camping at lost lake. Lost lake is in Kittitas county in washington state, near snoqualmie pass.  Lost lake is about 15 miles from I-90, up an old logging road.  We were the only people camping there at the time.  It was the year 1991, when this happened.  We had all went to sleep, M. and R. and his children (my friends) were sleeping in a tent, located about 30 feet away from our vehicles.  My wife and I were sleeping under a tarp that we had hung from a couple trees, located next to the vehicles.  At about 5:00 am in the morning something awoke me. Even the crickets had stopped chirping and it was dead silent.  I dont sleep very sound the first night i am out in the woods and we all had firearms with us.  I had my 45 auto under my pillow.  Well anyway, I woke up and set up on my elbows to see if i could see what had woke me up. However, M's Chevy Blazer was parked right next to us so I couldnt see what was behind it.  Then this animal screamed at me from the other side of the Blazer.  The sound is hard to discribe but what ever it was grunted twice and then let loose with a low blood curdling scream and then beat on its chest about six times, and then it was totally quiet.  I didnt here it walk off, and believe me i was listening as good as I could.  I guess I could have stood up and looked on the other side of the Blazer and saw what it was, but I really didnt what to know.  Even with my gun I didnt feel safe, and it sounded big.

"I saw the story about the BFRO on animal planet's Animal X show and the tape recorded ""calls"" you were using to attract Sasquatch was exactly what I heard about while camping on Lake Cle Elum in central Washington state. My Mom and i had gone camping for the weekend and Saturday morning she claimed she heard the most terrible screaming sound the night before that lasted a few hours.I'm a heavy sleeper so I told her to wake me up if the sound continued that night as well. Around four in the morning she woke me up and told me to listen. It wasn't long before I heard the screaming that sounded like nothing either of us had heard before. It was also very very loud.

"I was on a two day camping trip with several other adult volunteers and a group of about ten inner city youth.  We went out past Roslyn from Cle Elum toward Salmon La Sac and the Wenatchee National Forest.  There were many small dirt roads off Salmon La Sac road leading down to the resevoir on the left.  We decided to camp down one of these small road between the resevoir and the main road.  It was not a campground, but had some decent places for tents and had been used by campers before as evidenced by a fire ring.  There was another tent camper a few hundred yards away.  The weather was poor.  It began raining on the trip up and kept raining and drizzling off and on the entire time we were out there.  After unpacking all our gear and getting camp set up we began to notice medium sized rocks (golf ball to baseball sized) flying into our camp.  At first we thought it may have been one of the kids goofing around, but after an hour or so we had accounted for all the kids and the rocks kept up.  We continued to have rock thrown into our camp until the next morning.  In addition, roughly ten times during the night we heard very loud screams coming from further down our side of the resevoir.  We were a little worried because we weren't sure who or what was screaming.  If we weren't so far from a town we would have called the police for fear that someone was being hurt.  We took turns keeping watch until morning because of the wierd stuff going on.  At daybreak we decided to cut our trip short and head home.  The weather, rocks, and screams were just too much for some volunteer counselors to handle.  I didn't think of the possibility of sasquatch until several years later when I heard recordings of sasquatch screams that closely matched what we had heard that night.",From Cle Elum take highway 903 through Roslyn.

"My experiece happened in the fall of 1998. I was driving on a back road between Whitehall and Strum,WI. in Trempealeau county, just past the Rod & Gun club. It was close to sunset getting near dusk, but still enough light to see around the pond and edges near the woods.  The teraine is very wooded and there are very sharp corners so you have to really slow down. I always see wildlife on this road, so I drive very causiously. As I approched the sharp corner my head lights locked onto a pair of eyes in the tree about 10 feet off the road, directly in front of me. I thought it must be an owl. At about 20 feet from the corner a body started to drop down form the tree branch that the eyes were attached to. I could not believe what I was viewing. The creature looked like a child covered in hair. A height of 4-4.5 feet long. It dropped, hit the ground in a crouched position, did not full stand, but turned and ran up a revine. It took about 30 seconds for the whole thing to happen. But is something that is burned in to my mind forever. To this day I truely know I saw a child bigfoot. The face was covered in hair as was the body. The color was kind of a reddish brown.","Take Hwy.53 north out of Whittehall, to county road D north about 2 miles turn left toward the rod & gun club. go past the rod & gun.

"This incident happened when I was 13 years old and still I remember the event and the feeling of awe mixed with fear and disbelief I had that night. Today I am 41 and my work involves public safety. I spent 21 years in the armed forces Army and Navy, a veteran of two wars and been around the world 4 times. I still have not encountered anything like that summer night in Hayward Wisconsin. I was staying with my friend Joe and his dad at their home on Nelson Lake outside Hayward WI. It was approx. 0100, July, 1981, Joe and I were in our room reading and I went to use the rest room. A short time went by when I heard Joe say “Hey Greg quit messing around out side”, I couldn’t figure out what he was talking about. I returned to the room and asked him what he meant. He said he saw a shadow of me cast by the yard light from out back as I walked by the bed room window. He again asked what I was doing out back. I need to take a moment and explain two details: First, back then at 13 I had the 1980s hair band style hair going on (I had big hair), Sec we didn’t stop to think about the window being seven foot off the ground at that moment. After arguing a bit we agreed that it must be someone trying to steal tools or material from out back. We both gabbed our 22 cal rifles and flashlights and headed out the side door. Joe’s dad was asleep in his bedroom in the front and our room was in the back. As we stood on the deck and shined our flashlights around the property we heard a loud snap. The sound came from a log trail that ran from our fire wood area out into the woods. We shined our lights in that direction and we could see a huge black haired creature approx. 8’ or 9’ tall and very brawd, running upright up the path toward the woods. A moment later it was gone. I remembered being stunned and the two of us stood frozen in place for awhile. After we came in we were at a loss for words, but we were definitely scared. The following day a family friend named Randy stopped over and we looked around the back yard and the trail for tracks. It rained the night before and everything was pretty awash, but there was a limb down across the path that had a vague depression where it was broke as if what ever stepped on it snapped it in half. Randy weighed about 240 lbs and try breaking a similar piece by jumping on it with his weight, but was unsuccessful. Later that day we drove around the lake to pick up a pizza at one of the resorts. While waiting for our order I over heard some locals talking about strange sound, foot prints and broken fencing around their properties occurring the night before. I will always remember that summer.","BEING YEARS PAST, I AM UNSURE OF THE AREA CHANGES. THE PROPERTY WAS ON THE LAKE. IT WAS ON FARBER DR/RD.

"I worked for the marathon county parks department as a seasonal summer employee. My job was to go to all the county parks by myself most of the time and do routine park maintenance. I had to do everything from mow grass, to build shelters, and pick up garbage. Parks included were; eau pleine, mission lake, eau claire dells, amco park, cherokee park, big rapids, and man made lake. One early morning around 6am, I left to go to Amco park to clean it up in time for the weekend. Nobody else was with me, or at the park. I arrived around 6:20am. It was warm and pretty foggy at the time. The park was pretty clean so it didn't take long, only about 5-10 minutes to clean and take care of. As I was pulling out of the only road that leads to the road, to my left I saw something standing on the right side of the road up ahead. I stopped the truck, and sat there for about 10 seconds. Whatever this was looked my direction and took off across the road, towards the river, which was only hundred yards away. I sat there for a couple minutes wondering what it was that I think I had just seen. I hunt so I am for damn sure it was not a deer or bear. It was way too big to be a dog, coyote, fox, wolf, etc. It also moved very fast. This thing was big, hairy, and tall, your typical stereotypical sightings. I was at the time too freaked out to take time and check it out where it went. All I know is that it took off my direction behind me, towards the river. Everybody just laughed at me when I told them what I had seen, but the next time I went to that park a week later, no noises, no foot prints, nothing. I should have checked right away, but I was too scared, plus who knows what it was, and if it would come back?

"A couple years ago I sent you a report that my daughter and I heard a very loud series of calls that I thought could have been made by a bigfoot. After listening to the recordings of calls from central MI I am more convinced. In my report I had trouble putting into words what it sounded like, but the recordings are nearly exact as some of the recordings. Then this fall I was in the hospital and my wife started smoking and sitting on the porch at night for her nightly puff. She told me the coyotes were howling a lot. When I played the recording of what I heard she came from the next room and said (that's what I heard).

Then we sat to do an EVP session, before we started the recorders we heard something kill a deer, then it sounded so close we decided to maybe get out of there, we started to leave and got some eye shine, thought maybe coyotes, but looked at the pics, the eye shine is well over the 3 ft peas growing in the farm field, what's weird is I went out today, and there's nothing in the field disturbed, no blood, no body, no trace of anything??

"This is totaly unbelievable, it has happened again. I can not even believe this myself, one sighting in a lifetime is hard enough but when this thing shows itself to me again, I'm starting to think maybe it is hanging around in the same type of woodland areas that I do. I am a Pro. woodsman and most of my outdoor treks take me away from all other human interferance, another words I go where other people do not want to go or will not attempt to go. The reason for this is that in my area the public are getting more and more populated in the areas that I choose to hunt or just get away, so I travel in deeper woods and swamplands away from there interferance. Well as I said I have seen this thing again, and this time it was about 3 miles from where I had spotted it the first time during hunting season. This sighting was as though it was curious or that it was following me, staying in the shadows moving only when I moved. Although this time at first it took me by complete suprise, I remained calm and also let myself observe this thing's every noticed action, trying not to let it have any knowledge that I was watching it as well. I would move taking a slow pace for about 50 yards at a time, turn to my side and kneel down acting like I was picking at the ground. It would stop and watch me from the shadows, as I move another 50 yards and watched it, it would wait till I would get about another 50 yards then it would stop and simulate what I was doing, it would crouch down and paw at the ground where I was kneeling. It would continue to sniff at the air and try to catch scent of me. After about a hour of this cat and mouse it dissapeared. I got a real uneasy feeling when I notice it about 75 yards to my right it was flanking me. This action made me very nervous, I have seen this with coyotes tracking a wounded deer. The thought ran in my mind that it was hunting me, but this feeling passed as I kept moving on. Again it would only move when I would move, perhaps it knew that its movments would be hidden by my coinciding movements, or it was trying to get in a direction of catching my scent. I kept moving in a southeast direction, stopping every 50 yards acting like I was digging and rutting around on the ground, keeping my head down and turning looking up with my eyes and not moving my head up. I thought it was gone but noticed it behind a uprooted tree root system peeking through a hole in the roots. It was closer now and was not aware that I new its location, at only about 30 yards I could make out its eyes and the right half of its face. The eyes seemed to be the color of a whitetail deer, no whites only dark. I moved on and after about another half an hour I was getting close to a area that loggers had clear cut, and it was gone. I sat in the area for at least another hour but it did not appear to me again. While I was watching this thing I got a chance to observe it and notice a lot of its features and charicteristics. Its height is only about 6 to 6 1/2 foot, it stays in the shadows, has dark brown hair with blackish streaks almost like what you could call brindle. Walks with a hunched over ape like character. I did not notice any smell. And it made no sound. I am convinced that this is a creature that with some time I can get close enough to again. No one can tell me that this freek of nature does not exist. It has showed itself to me twice.","1 mile north of Lugerville grade road and 1/2 mile east of rock creek road, deep woods.",Price County,Wisconsin,Fall,Report 8121: Hunting & fishing guide has afternoon encounter in deep woods near Lugerville,45.775,-90.444,7/14/2004,8121,Class A,cbpsmvhdwn,78.86,66.715,54.57,58.22,0.73,0.33,0.91,0,0,,,Partly cloudy in the afternoon.,7,10,350,5.04

"[From Don Young, a BFRO Investigator in Price County, Wisconsin.] I did a 5 day 4 night camping trip by myself at [a location in Price County]. It was slow at first. I was not picking up anything with the thermal [imager], not even rodents or other animals, as if the woods around me were devoid of life. The 3rd night I had a feeling of being watched so I stayed close to the truck and set up the thermal to watch the tent. Nothing came around the tent. On the 4th night things started to happen. A thrown rock or piece of wood came very close to my tent and hit a tree with a very loud thud-pop. I got out of the tent and panned around with the thermal, which was running already outside the tent. It was on a tripod aimed down a trail off the [dirt road]. It looked like nothing was out there. After about an hour of panning around with the thermal I stood back up and stretched. I aimed the thermal to watch the walking trail, and then I started to go back into the tent when I heard the sounds of brush cracking on both sides of me. This was so close to me that it made the hair on my neck bristle instantly. I started to pan with the thermal again from one side to the other. After what seemed like about a half hour into it, a bright warm blip in the appeared in the background. It was some kind of animal along down the walking trail. It seemed to be on the edge of the trail and low to the ground. After I watched it for a while with the thermal I got the sense that it was watching me, and it was peeking over a clump of brush on the edge of the trail. I watched it for a while, until I accidentally kicked into my bag of cans and garbage.  I also bumped into the tripod when this happened, which jerked the thermal to the right a bit. Then the blip stood up and ran off on two legs, hunched over. I could hear it as it ran away from me to the north. I could hear the brush and its footsteps fading into the distance. As the sound trailed off, all around me the brush started to thrash and snap.  I continued to pan around me but saw nothing. The edge growth was so thick on the sides of this overgrown road that the imager could only see in 10-15 feet or so. Something was back in that brush, on both sides of me. There was two of them, and they both got noisy at the same time as, if trying to get my attention. It seemed like they wanted to get my attention so that I would not follow the one that was walking away. I couldn't see the ones to the side through the thick brush.  I looked for a while, but then gave up trying to see them that way. The other way was to aim the thermal imager at the tent, and set it up to record all night, then go sleep. I went to sleep with the thermal aimed at the tent. I could hear things to the sides of the road for a while. I could only hope they would come closer to the tent. Didn't happen though, so I drove home in the morning to review the footage that I was sure I got. I watched it on the computer when I got home. It looked like a sasquatch to me. It was peeking over brush for a while, and moving strangely, and then running away hunched over, like it was dodging a sniper. It was no bear, or other four-legged animal. It was bipedal and it was agile. When I shot this footage it was almost pitch black outside. There was no moon. So this thing has the ability to run through the dense brush in total darkness, and watch me in total darkness. I got the impression from the video that it had long arms and big hands and very muscular legs. It doesn't look very large. It could be a juvenile. It seems to have that spirit to its movements. The other ones that made the noise around me may have been young ones also. The other cameras (trailcams) I had set up around my camp area picked up nothing. I did not have a light on or any lantern. It was a cold camp. There was no camp fire for the entire stay. The squatches arrived at 1:00 AM on the fourth night or 5th morning, and seemed to be all gone at around 2:30 to 3:00 AM. It was total darkness out there. The trees had a thick canopy over the road. It blocked out any night sky. Without the thermal I could only see darkness.","[The location is outside Phillips, Wisconsin, not far from the target area of the 2006 expedition.]",Price County,Wisconsin,Summer,Report 24265: BFRO Investigator obtains first thermal footage (very brief) outside Phillips,45.73271,-90.42001,7/12/2008,24265,Class A,cbpsnmqhm5,73.56,65.375,57.19,52.85,0.65,0.39,0.33,0.0273,1,rain,,"Breezy starting in the afternoon, continuing until evening, and light rain overnight.",10,10,242,9.87

"I know it has been almost two years since this incident, but a friend of mine encouraged me to report the sound I heard in the north woods of Wisconsin. After harvesting a whitetail deer earlier in the evening near my cabin, my father and I decided to transport the deer to a friends cabin about 6 miles northwest of our cabin to field dress the animal. We did this as we did not want the entrails to be left near our cabin for our dog or any other wildlife to pick through. We arrived at the cabin about an hour after nightfall and I began to clean the deer. I was standing in a small ditch that runs off the back of the gravel driveway. Behind me is a dense pocket of evergreens and between myself and the cabin which is about 40 yards away was my father holding a flashlight and the truck also with its headlights in my direction. To my right was a small storage shed. Past my father is the driveway leading to the cabin and lining the outside of the driveway was a stance of evergreens which block my view of a small field with underbrush and small pockets of bushes. On the other side of the cabin is more open forest which is privately owned and surrounded by national paper land. As I began cleaning the deer I heard a loud whoop come from just the other side of the cabin. The whoop was loud and became louder as it ended. Following that were three shorted whoops that were fairly similar to one another, but much sorter than the first. It did not last more than about 7 seconds and was calm again. What was so frightening about the sound was the purity and intensity of the sound, it felt as though it engulfed your entire body. The sound frightened us so badly that my father and I both quickly returned to the truck, bloody knife and all and shined the flashlight in the general direction, it scared us enough that when I asked my father to drive up to the cabin to have a look he refused. After about 15 minutes in the truck I quickly finished the cleaning and we headed out of there, both pretty shaken up over what we had heard. Now, I have been hunting in the north woods since I was 12 years old and I have heard some pretty odd sounds in my time, but this one was unlike anything I have ever heard. I have listened to coyotes and heard their strange screams and cries and have listened to many owls both up north and at my home, but I can honestly say they were nothing alike. I decided to post this after listening to the two first recorded sounds you have on the website and find them to be pretty close to the sound I heard, yet a bit different. Ever since I have told this story to my friend he has been fascinated by Sasquatch research and this site. With some research and encouragement fro him, I decided to finally add this sound. I realize it is hard to explain the sound, but I will never forget it and neither will my father.",Specific directions omitted.,Florence County,Wisconsin,Fall,Report 28065: Possible vocalizations heard while cleaning a deer near Florence,45.95359,-88.38782,10/26/2008,28065,Class B,f01jkttgnd,45.17,38.025,30.88,35.17,0.81,0.61,0.93,0.0016,1,rain,999.46,Light rain in the evening.,2,9.96,281,5.44

I have been haunted for 5 years by an experience I had when I lived in Door County Wisconsin.  I lived in a small town called Forestville.  We lived in the woods.  I should have called the DNR when it happened but I wrote it off as a bear even though I know all the bears in Wisconsin are black.  What I saw in a thicket beside my house was redish brown.  I walked down my driveway to get the mail....it was very early Spring.  I heard loud noises that sounded more like a man than an animal.  I peered through the thicket and all I could see was the hump of its' back as it pounded its' head or shoulder against the tree.  It was large.  I was so very curious to see more that I walked up onto our mound so I could look down into the thicket.  I could not see it better but it must have picked up my sent or seen me because it ran toward me.  I could hear it running and growling.  It hit some downed trees and could not catch up to me....I heard it hit the trees as I was running to my back door.   I am not crazy.  I am an educated woman.  I know what I experienced.  I have contacted the DNR of Wisconsin from where I live now because I just have not been able to get the experience out of my mind...it haunts me.  The DNR said it could not have been a bear.

"The Wisconsin River runs right by my town.  I am an avid deer hunter, turkey hunter, fisherman and so on.  I have been in the woods my whole life (48 years old) in this area and I had never seen this before.  I was leaving to go deer hunting and I had just pulled onto the main highway along the river and started to accelerate when I looked down into the river bottoms where there are a lot of tops and trees and general river wash and sitting on a log was a what looked like a very large hairy man all dressed in a shaggy brown fur.  It was just coming daylight and I was doing about 20 miles an hour when I went by but its head was down in between its shoulder blades like and I remember that the legs just looked huge and the top of the head was cone shaped.  I got down to the intersection and turned around and went back but when I got back whatever was there was already gone.  There is a natural high bank bend in the river about 30 yards from where it was sitting so whatever it was could have moved under that and out of sight.  I have heard sounds that are on tape since I was a young boy coon hunting with my dad in these bottoms and my dad always said that something followed us while we were coon hunting the river bottoms but since it didn't bother us he never bothered it and that him and my uncle would often skin the coon right in the woods and leave the carcass for whatever was there.  They called the one valley north of us ""The Screaming Woman Valley"" because late at night in the late fall, early winter people used to hear screams from the bottoms that were often just put off as a bobcat or lynx.

"I had the ecnounter while in college in Ashland Wisconson in 1978. While bowhunting with a friend deep in the woods I took to sitting high in a tree overlooking thick briars. Out of the still and silence of the woods an animal came barreling through the thickest vegetation imaginable. It was thrashing about and shrieking at the highest pitch possible. I was frithened to death and could only stand to try to see it. I could not see it but did see the brush being shaken. Again the shrill sound of its voice filled the air. It was awesome to hear, scary but awesome. My friend who was hunting down from me did see it and it was on two legs and appeared apelike to him.

"I was telling a long-time friend about a BF sighting a common friend of ours had related to me. He said, ""You know, I saw something several years ago."" He went on to say he was fishing on the Sioux River near Big Rock in Bayfield County as he had for nearly 20 years. He was upstream where the River crosses Big Rock Road. He was walking along the bank on the way back, focusing on his footing as he had chest waders on carried his rod. He looked up as a black animal, 3-4 feet tall, on the next bend in the river, about 60-70 feet ahead of him, seemed to do at the same time. He watched as it immediately ""launched"" itself away from him ""arms outstretched"" and a ""blur"" it moved so fast, ""cut into the water at least 10 feet into the river and made a splash"" then disappeared under the water. He watched and waited at least 3 minutes for it to surface but it never did. He thought about going to the sandbar it was originally on to check for tracks but would have had to backtrack several bends in the river, cross, then ""bushwhack"" all the way on the opposite side. He was already sweating and decided to just walk on out to the car.

"A guy of friend and I were fishing and spending a couple of days in northern Wisconsin. After a day of fishing we were driving back to the cabin at around 6 or 7 pm. After just passing(heading east) the Tahkodah golf course, I was looking out the back seat (on the drivers side) and saw this brown figure kneel down behind some bushes as we drove by. Due to the curves in the road, we were probably going around 25-35 mph. It lasted only a split second, and something didn't register right with what I saw. I was going to remain silent until the driver of the Jeep said, ""Did anyone just see that?"" He had seen the same thing-a brown figure kneel down, like a human, to hide behind the tall bushes. I affirmed that I saw it, but didn't know what it was, so wasn't going to say anything. I've seen bears fall from their hind legs to all fours and this wasn't the same falling forward motion. It was as though someone standing upright and then kneeling down, in a straight fashion, to a crouching position. We didn't go back to investigate b/c we were too scared.","We were staying in a cabin on Hwy D, just north of Lake Namekagon. We were fishing on Lake Owen, which is to the west of Lake Namekagon.

"On June 1,2002  I checked out animal tracks on a muddy curve near Danbury, Wisconsin.  I soon noticed a 17 1/4 inch human like footprint. So drove into town to purchase a camera and casting material. Before leaving the find area I tossed some apples from the car into the brush at the site. Returning there after about one hour in town and driving. I took photos of the footprint and surrounding area. I then began to cast the print. While doing this a commotion of rustling bushes started up nearby. It appearred to do so without benefit of much wind. So I stood up apprehensibly and looked in that direction. As I stepped back to get a better look the rustling""bushes shot twenty feet in the air accompanied by a loud crack. Where upon the top of a birch tree that had been pulled down and shaken fell to the shoulder of the road within a few feet of me. That was followed by three or four whinny type vocalizations very close by in the woods. The sound did not appear to be a threatening one but rather a mischievious chuckle of some type. Days later the outline of a bigfoot creature was found on one of the photos. I am with holding that photo until I can authenticate it thoroughly.

"April 2004 Our family has land just out side of Hatfield towards Neilsville.  We decided to take our camper up to the land and stay overnite with our 3 children.  At aprox 2:00am I woke up because I heard something walking around the camper.  We are in a remote area in the woods near a gravel road.  The footsteps were right next to the camper.  I was very still but knew that my husband was also awake.  I whispered to him ""do you hear that?"" He replied that he did and it woke him also.  He had hoped that It would not wake me.  We were very still for a few minutes listening to the steps.  This was a creature that was walking on two feet.  We could hear the crunching of leaves and twigs under it's feet.  We decided to make some noise and see if we could scare whatever it was away. I flipped on the camper lights and we yelled for whoever it was to make themselves known as we were armed.  Nothing replied but the foot steps stopped.  We waited about 5 muinutes and turned the lights off again and waited. About 10 minutes after that the foot steps started again.  My husband went outside with his flashlight and weapon to take a look.  Keep in mind it is a really dark night and we are set in the woods away from anyone who might be able to hear us if we needed help.  Again, nothing.  He came back in and we settled down again, 10 minutes later the steps started again.  I know that this is something on two feet that is not afraid of us but is not human.  We decided to get out of there with our boys.  My husband stood outside while I carried them into our mini van and we left.  We spent the night in the parking lot of Kwik Trip in Black River Falls.  In the morning we went back to break the camper down and look around for traces of anything unusual.  Because of the heavy leaf and pine needles covering the ground we were unable to find any footprints.  We looked at the camper and tried to determine if something was rubbing on it to make the sound.  There was nothing there. As we were taking the camper down I felt really creepy, like we were being watched.  My father in law several years earlier told my husband that he saw a big foot crossing Fischer Rd on his way back to camp.  He told my son that he thought he saw one in the woods while deer huntiong also.  My husband while hunting when he was younger found several deer carcases in the woods all piled on topp of each other.  At the time they dismissed it as someone hitting them with a vehicle and dragging them into the woods.  Now when he looks back at it he thinks they were way too far into the woods for someone to drag in from the road. The carcases were picked clean. While we never saw anything I really truly believe we had a bigfoot encounter.   I know that the creature walked on two feet and had a long stride.   It came back over and over again.  I wish we would have had a stronger flashlight, we only had a mag light on us.  Now we have a really high power flashlight in the event we need to look far into the woods. I have been back to the spot several times and my husband and his family hunt every year in that same spot.  As far as we know nobody else has had the same experince.  I will never go back and camp  there again.  If they are as big as people say they are they are it could have easily pulled my kids out of that camper through the canvas. My husband and I have jobs that require us to be honest and not embelish experinces.  This was by far the most terrifying thing I have ever been through.","Forest Road, north of Hatfield, witness prefers to keep exact location private.",Clark County,Wisconsin,Spring,Report 14987: Family in a camper describes stalking outside town of Hatfield,44.4723,-90.7167,4/15/2004,14987,Class B,9zzkzxyjgt,68.96,57.95,46.94,36.37,0.53,0.33,0.88,0,0,,1014.2,Mostly cloudy starting in the afternoon.,7,10,132,7.67
"My experience happened in early fall of 2011. It was warm that year and this happened right before Halloween. I was out walking at Douglas County Park with my boyfriend, his friend and my youngest son who was 3 at the time. We walked back past the corn field and worked our way to the bridge that crossed a creek just before you hit the heavy wooded area. I was tossing leaves in the creek on one side of the bridge and Ethan would run to the other side to look for it floating down stream. I heard a series of loud knocks from the woods, I looked at my friends and they heard it too.  It was suggested that it was probably just other people out walking. So I shrugged it off. We started back towards our car because it was starting to get dark and I heard a loud scream. It was nothing I had heard before, too clear to be human.. and too loud for coyote. It did give me the creeps, my friends acted as if it was nothing and we kept walking. A few minutes later I heard a loud scream again only this time it was closer. At that point I picked up my son looked behind me and all I could see was tall grass. Nothing there, my friends made a joke about it being a bigfoot and we worked our way back to the car. I have never heard a yell like that before and could not point it to any animal that I know of.  For the record it sounded nothing like the screams on “Finding Bigfoot” It was loud, higher pitched almost like a female scream but there was no strain to it. I believe what I heard was a Sasquatch.","Donald county park has Deer Creek running through it and there is a large area of water shed land.

"It was a warm June afternoon when my dog Sadie and I went for a walk back in the woods on our property. After we walked threw the woods on our property i decided to take the gravel road the mile or so back home instead of traveling threw the woods again. I got a half mile away from the house when i kept hearing something like a rock or a branch hitting against a tree. At first i thought it was just animals or my husband goofing off in the woods to scare me. When i reached where i thought the noise was coming from i stopped and was looking up into the woods, but i couldnt see anything, so i proceed to yell, ha ha very funny because like i said i thought it was my husband. Well the banging got louder then stopped completly. I got the feeling something was watching me so i told Sadie lets go girl and started to walk a little faster.

I told my husband about it when i got home and realized it was not him he had been there the whole time.

"My fiance B. and I just got done watching a movie, when the dogs started barking, then within 5 minutes they got really quiet, and went into their dog houses.  We thought this was strange so we opened our back door toward where the dogs were barking at a few minutes before and saw something near our mineral feeder for the cows. We live on a farm so we had an unused mineral feeder in the back yard. It looked at first that it was on all 4 legs, and as big as the outline was we assumed it was a bear, until it stood up on two legs.  Now mind you we still thought it was a bear because well you know bears do stand on there hind legs.  We had our back porch light on so we could see it, but the thing we saw was still about maybe 80 ft away.  Anyway what we thought was strange was after it stood up it heard us at our back door,and turned its head our way and when it did we saw big yellow like eyes, we looked at each other to make sure we both were seeing the same thing.  Then we saw its side arm move and it looked like it was below its knees.

"hello. some time back i submitted a report about strange noises i and my family had been hearing over the years. i spoke with someone on the phone from bfro about it and informed him that my father had actually seen a bigfoot here in the past. well, much to my shock and horror i have seen one too. i was checking on my children in their bedroom last night at about 1:00 in the morning, when i saw the motion detection light we have mounted on the outside of the house go on. where my childrens bedroom is it is right against a hillside that leads to very dense woods. anything can walk out of the woods and onto a small porch that we have off of my childrens bedroom. well, anyhow as i was saying, i was checking on them and there is a window that you can look out onto this porch {it is on the second floor, but up against the woods} and also a door for access.when the light came on i instinctively looked over to the window because i knew whatever had set it off would be either there on that porch or in the woods. it goes off if a raccoon or a cat scurries by so itis not uncommon for this to occur. when i looked over to that window i could not breathe. all i could see was a massive, coal black, very shaggy haired creature standing there on two very bulky legs looking in the window at me. i felt very frightened, as this window is only about 6 feet from where my childrens beds are. i could not see anything but the two legs and the rear end of this thing because the window has a blind on it that was halfway down. it is one of those straw blinds that you can see through partially. with the light shining behind this thing i could make out the perfect outline of it's upper body. i am about 5 feet tall and this thing was, i am guessing, about 8 feet tall because it towered over the window. it just stood there for a brief moment and then went in the direction of the woods. i was too scared to go over to the window and look and see where it went. i took my children into my bedroom last night and i laid awake in fear all night.what i keep remembering is the muscles and the bulk in the legs. the rear end {the butt} also was quite muscular. and that ratty coal black fur. there was no smell at all and it made no noise. i am sure that the light coming on suddenly spooked it, but i got the impression that it was curious as to what was inside my home. it gives me the shakes to think of it. it was a cold winter night last night, but the ground was still muddy so i mustered up some courage this morning and went looking for tracks.i found some long slide marks on the hillside as if something had slid down the mud. no distinct footprints though.",Off of rt 2 in warwood.,Ohio County,West Virginia,Winter,Report 10006: A woman has late night sighting when a motion detecting light illuminates her back porch,40.1333,-80.68192,12/12/2004,10006,Class A,dpnsk411rj,37.97,34.13,30.29,28.72,0.78,0.95,0.03,0.0037,1,snow,1006.32,Mostly cloudy throughout the day and breezy in the evening.,2,9.16,232,11.3

"I always said I did not believe in bigfoot. I would say, I would have to see it to believe it. I love the woods and hunting. I spend as much time in these woods as possible and always have. I have never seen ANYTHING until now. I still have a hard time calling it a bigfoot. I have tried to rationalize it every way possible in my own mind. I can only come up with one conclusion; I saw and heard a ""Bigfoot"" It took me a long time to tell anyone other than my parents and wife. I know I have to report the sighting, so here goes. It was Saturday night at 11:30 pm, on January the 13th. It was raining, at times hard. I was driving south on route 55, coming up on Seneca Rocks, towing a U-Haul trailer driving about 45 mph. I had passed the gas station on the right, then the school on the left. Next on the left there is a brick house the government owns but never seems to use. This is just before the entrance to the park and the intersection to head to Harman, the direction I was headed. Passing the house is where I saw it. At first I thought it was a man in a special forces outfit, some type of sniper gear. My first thought was what is he doing out there on a night like tonight dressed like that. It was not really running more like a swaggering lope. It had long hair, what at first looked liked shredded material with clumps in it, hanging all off of its body. As I passed it I quickly noticed that it had this ""covering"" right up over its head. It seemed to have no neck, just a large head. I also realized it was very tall, and had very wide shoulders and its arms hung very low almost to its knees, if not below. It was walking or sort of trotting on hind legs like a man, but with a movement like an ape. It was only 20 feet or so from me. I realized it wasn't a man or anything else I had ever seen. I got a very good look at it. The whole thing still seems to have been in slow motion, It still plays in my head that way. In any case it hit me, what the Hell was that? I turned my truck trailer and all around within 50 yards right in the middle of the road. I pulled into the driveway and shined my headlights behind the house into the woods. I saw nothing. I pulled back onto the road and into the grass where I saw it. I stopped and shined my mag lite into the woods. It really got spooky. I heard it going through the brush. It made the noise you would expect a large creature to make. Then it seemed to be trying to scare me or get a reaction out of me, the way a deer will stomp its feet at you when it can't wind you. It made a type of laughing/squealing noise and a grunting noise. It pounded wood together, not a small piece hitting another piece. It was more of a large piece of wood being pounded on another large piece. This went on for 3 to 5 minutes then nothing. I was amazed. The next day I went back and combed the area. All I found was what appears to be footprints I took and still have pictures of them. What amazed me was, when I did go on the Internet on a friends advice, some other reported sightings were the similar including the sounds I heard.

"On June the 18th 2007, my daughter and I were going to Whites Run near Seneca Rocks to go trout fishing and camping.  It was very late,around 1:00 in the A.M., with very little moon.  I was coming to the top of a mountain with a speed of around 40 miles an hour on US33/St. Rt. 55. As I reached the top of the mountain two furry looking beings were directly in front of our vehicle and both of them looked at my daughter and I and then took a dive into some bushes on the right shoulder of the hwy.  The funny thing is that they appeared ape like but the fur was short and I am really serious that these two creatures did not run they took a big head first dive into those bushes.

"My family owns land in West Virginia, so we went down camping this past Fourth of July weekend. We went to Seneca Rocks to climb them, and on the way down I took a shortcut away from my family. I realized the trail I took started to fade and I was lost, after going downhill a little while through rough rocky, tree filled and bush filled terrain that is home to deer, bear, and snakes, I heard thumps (footsteps) and tree branches cracking. I stopped and got cold chills, about 30 yards east of me on a 45 degree angle at 4:43 pm I saw the back side of a orange and brownish haired thing moving up hill quick. It had thick black hands and feet and I would guess that it was about 6'5 to 7'0 tall and again was moving up hill through rocks very quickly. I tried to go over to the area, but the sound stopped and it was gone, I found my way back to a path about an half hour later and made my way down to tell my family, who still don’t believe me...I can say one thing, it sure was a crazy experience that raised the hair on the back of my neck.",Take route 28 to it or map quest Seneca Rocks,Pendleton County,West Virginia,Summer,Report 20101: Afternoon sighting by hiker at Seneca Rocks,38.835,-79.3686,7/2/2007,20101,Class A,dnzscvtw38,72.78,62.93,53.08,46.74,0.63,0.13,0.57,0,0,,1024.24,Partly cloudy in the morning.,11,7.93,41,1.08
"I didn't actually see the creature, but was riding in the car with my boyfriend when all this occurred. We were coming back from a trip to Ohio with a detour to see some friends in West Virginia. Instead of taking interstates home to Virginia, we took US 33, a very twisty mountain road, heading east. I was dozing in the passenger seat when I was startled by my boyfriend yelling ""what the hell was that?!"" I sat straight up, and noticed that whoever was in the car behind us suddenly hit the brakes and flashed up the high beams. We were only going about 30 anyway because we were rounding a curve, so he got a pretty good view of whatever it was. His first description was ""some guy was walking on the road in a tree costume."" After he told me a few more details, I yelled, ""Sasquatch! That's what you saw!"" I immediately took some notes. This is what he says that he saw: human-like figure, at least six feet tall and very bulky, with very long hair (""the hairiest thing I've ever seen""). It was a mossy grayish green color. It was walking along the side of the road upright like a man, but slightly hunched over with knees bent and elbows sticking out (""an ape-like walk, definitely not human""). It had no distinguishable facial features, because it was so hairy. He says the arms were six to eight inches wide and the legs were wider, at least eight inches. The creature also did not react to the sound and light from our car or the one behind us. He says it was absolutely not a bear, deer or large dog. Without our headlights, it was completely dark with just a little moonlight. The creature had no light source, and if it was a man (in a pretty elaborate costume), it was on a heck of a walk because there was not anything within reasonable walking distance, especially with no light.","We were somewhere between Harmon and Seneca Rocks, West Virginia on US 33.

"I had identified through the VA game finder website that Rockingham county (VA) was a good area for turkey hunting.  The spot I chose allowed us to park at a campsite (WV) and hike into the woods around 7-8 miles to the hunting spot (VA).  Let me start by saying that I was never into and never followed Bigfoot.  I know the story of course but never payed any real attention to it until I came home from the trip. We arrived at the campground late.  There was only 1 other camper there with a RV.  We started into the woods around 5pm.  The terrain is extremely rugged and steep.  As we were hiking we noticed that it was very quiet.  Not a single bird call, or anything.  It was an eerie feeling.  We set up camp about 3 miles on the path that led up to the observation tower (High Knob).  We had dinner and got into the tent around 9-10 pm.  Around 11-12 pm my brother and I heard a very odd howl, it lasted for around 10 seconds.  It was not a dog or bear or anything I had heard before.  I thought it was strange but assured my brother it was nothing.  Around 2 pm my friend woke me up and pointed at his ear, signaling me to listen.  I paused and listened.  To me I heard what sounded like someone  slowly walking up to our tent, choosing their steps very carefully.  I whispered to him its a deer to calm his nerves.  But all three of us listened as the steps got closer.  The steps were heavy but slow.  My brother said to me ""Get the shotgun.""  But not in a whisper.  The steps stopped and sounded like they went the other direction.  I got out of the tent and saw nothing, it was too dark.  The next morning we continued up the hill.  At the top of hill .5 mile from where we camped there was a large pile of feces with acorns in it.  Possibly bear, not sure.  My brother was in poor psychical condition and could not continue so we decided to leave. When I got home I decided to see if i could find an animal call matching the sound we had heard.  I looked up a lot of different animals, from cougars to foxes.  Nothing matched.  Until I found a bigfoot website with sound recordings.  The first one I clicked was it.  I called my brother on the phone and said recognize this?  Played the recording and he said ""Hell yeah, that's what we heard in the woods."" I've done a lot of research on Bigfoot since that trip and I'll be going back there this November, I'll try and do a few calls or knocks and see what happens.","Go west on 33 from VA to the WV side, first campground on the left before Brandywine.",Pendleton County,West Virginia,Winter,Report 30154: Turkey hunters hear possible howl and bipedal steps approach their camp near Brandywine,38.57502,-79.18524,11/1/2010,30154,Class B,dnzeqn75f0,48.42,35.52,22.62,30.16,0.76,0.02,0.83,0,0,,,Clear throughout the day.,4,10,44,1.14
"On August 30 2012 between 9:07-9:45pm. I was traveling to my father's home in the Moyers area of Pendleton county, WV. I decided to stop along side of a small road, county rt 25 Moyers Gap rd. I stopped half way up Hoover mountian when I heard an unusual howl sounding like three woops (I'm pretty certain it was three). Being familiar with both wild animal sounds and those of farm animals I was startled because I immediately thought of sounds I've heard Bobo make on the show. I cupped my hands around my mouth and attempted to recreate the sound i just heard. I gave three loud woop sounds in medium tempo. After about 5-10 seconds I heard two woop sounds coming from the same direction as the first down over the mountain to my left. Again I cupped my hands and let out two loud woop sounds in about the same tempo as i had just heard. This time I heard a sharp crack of wood and a different type of howl, it sounded angry or frustrated maybe? to me. Unfortunately, a white gmc pick up truck began coming down the mountain. The loud crack and howl were the last sounds I heard that night. I waited for about 45 minutes in the truck I was driving, several times I attempted to get responses by making woop sounds none of my calls were returned again. I was so excited by this encounter.

"On November 19th 2012 the first day of hunting season in West Virginia, I experienced a few events that I am unable to explain. My step father and I were hunting in Pendleton County and had split up on either side of a ridge. At around 6 am before daylight, I heard a loud ""whooping"" that was so loud it almost sounded as if it came from an amplifier. This only happened once, but my step father and I both heard it and agreed it wasn't a normal animal sound. After lunch we went back into the woods. We split up again, this time I was going to try to hunt a thicker area than I did in the morning. The treestand I was going to had large boulders behind it with some very thick vegetation. I began climbing the treestand when all of a sudden in behind me in the boulders going up the ridge I heard what sounded like a very angry growl and what sounded like two rocks being smashed together violently. I jumped halfway out of the tree off the ladder, and as I turned around to see what had growled at me (which I thought was a bear) I saw a large black/dark brown head and shoulders quickly duck behind a boulder. This was the most frightened I have ever been in the woods. I backpedalled as quickly as I could in the other direction, never losing sight of the boulder. When I was about 100 yards away, the thing peeked out again and quickly shot back behind the boulder when it saw I was watching. Needless to say I got out of there. No idea what this was, but whatever it was, wasn't happy.",,Pendleton County,West Virginia,Winter,"Report 37565: Hunters hear possible vocalizations, large head seen peeking from behind boulders near Franklin",38.6492,-79.26241,11/19/2012,37565,Class B,dnzeu7fggv,48.92,38.115,27.31,32.73,0.84,0.52,0.21,0,0,,,Overcast until afternoon.,2,8.42,58,0.47
"I live in Pocahontas county near the Monongahela National Forest. It covers pretty much all of the county. It was on a mountain named Spruce Flat. I can look out my front window and see it. I have heard a howl much like the one from Ohio come from there. While walking down the road one night me and a friend heard a strange vocalization then the sound of heavy footsteps coming down the field to our right. They sounded pretty intent, so I got out my gun. Then I heard a crunch and a thud as the footsteps went over the side of the hill to our left, circled around until it was right beside us at the bottom of the hill. It never showed itself. It stayed out of the light but it did make another vocalization, the same one it made before coming down the field. It was sort of a high pitched hoot but it dragged out kind of long. It wasn't an owl. I am familiar with the local animals and the sounds they make. This was something new to me.

"I was on the BFRO's West Virginia expedition this past April. The expedition lasted ten days all together.  I participated from April 7 to April 11, as did over a dozen other people.  The base camp was along the Greenbrier River. Almost all of the incidents on this expedition happened within a few miles of this base camp. On the first morning after I arrived I heard a vocalization very much like the Ohio Howl recording. [Click for the Ohio Howl recording.] I was just falling asleep in my tent when I heard it. At first I thought the guides were call-blasting. It was long-drawn-out moaning howl. It sounded real, and clear.  It was echoing up through the river canyon.  There may have been an upturn or a sharp yelp at the end. It was startling. While I was thinking about the sound, I heard radio calls going back and forth from some of the people who were near the river: ""What was that?"" and ""Did anyone else hear that howl?"" When everyone returned to camp, I and the other people who heard the howl compared notes. We all agreed that it was a loud, distant, echoing animal sound, and it was similar to the Ohio Howl. [Click for the Ohio Howl recording.] ------------------------------------------------- The next incident occurred on the second night. I hiked with two other people along a river trail to rendezvous with another small group. We were on a stretch of the Greenbrier across from a very large tract of land where hunting is forbidden, and where whitetail deer are abundant. One of the guys in my group had gen-3 night vision goggles. At one point he asked if I and the other guy could see a spotlight up ahead. We saw nothing except the starry sky and the silhouettes of the hills around us. After taking the goggles off and on, he said it must be an infrared beam up ahead. It was visible through the nightvision goggles, but not visible to the naked eye. The person up ahead who was shining the infrared beam was with the small group that we were trying to rendezvous with. He was sweeping the light beam across the riverbank on the other side, as if he heard something over there and was trying to illuminate it. We reached them and asked if something happened. They said they thought they heard something over there, but it was probably just a deer snorting.  We stayed with them for a while. Eventually they got cold and wanted to go back to camp. The three of us stayed on the trail. One guy slept on the trail for a half hour. When he woke up he asked if anything happened while he was sleeping. We had not heard anything so we all agreed to give it a few more minutes then  hike back to the vehicle. The first sound happened as we were getting up on our feet. It was a loud splash in the river. It was a bit like a carp or a gar would produce on a warm-water lake on a summer night. This isn't warm water though. Two of us heard the first splash and didn't know what to make of it. A few moments later, it happened again. This time it was louder. All three of us heard it clearly. One guy mentioned that some of the reports from the Greenbrier were from fisherman. Some said they've heard rocks thrown into the water near them when they were fishing at night on the river. People from this area know what a beaver tail slap sounds like. It wouldn't happen in this river anyway. The Greenbrier is a swift moving, snow melt river in April. It's not the sort of body of water that beavers will guard and slap their tails in. Beavers will quietly swim around and slap their tails in ponds, lakes and slow moving creeks.  It sounds like a big rock hitting the water. Beavers won't do this in rivers with strong currents and rapids though. A beaver would get swept away in April if it wasn't constantly using its tail to fight the current here. We started moving back along the trail, back toward the vehicle. We didn't want to scare off the splasher, whatever it was, by shining bright lights across the river. We actually wanted it to follow us, and it did. We strolled down the trail with out headlamps turned off. We talked and laughed at normal volume. We wanted to make our presence known. We wanted to show that we were on the move, and make it clear that we weren't trying to sneak up on anything. Before long we heard another loud splash. We stopped and listenned. Nothing. We started walking and talking again. Within a few minutes there was another loud splash. It was keeping pace with us on the opposite side of the river. We kept walking and talking and joking and laughing along the river trail. Every few minutes there was another loud splash, directly across the river from us as we walked down the trail. We were obviously being paralleled by something. After each splash we would stop for just a moment to get a bearing on the direction of the sounds. We also listenned for walking or brush snapping sounds, but there was too much noise from the rapids to hear anything subtle. We returned to the truck and drove back to camp. We told everyone who was still up about what happened, before turning in for the night. --------------------------------------- On the third night, most of the participants spread out along the same river trail. All the vehicles were parked well away from the river, up on a bluff. There was a twisting, steep gravel road for accessing the river. I had to walk this road by myself after accompanying some attendees back to their vehicle.  As I was looking up the slopes above me I saw a stick come flying from right to left. The stick hit a tree, and bounced, and fell onto the road in front of me. The stick was the thickness of a baseball bat, but longer. When I caught up with the other people I told them what happened. One guy walked back to the spot with me. As we were getting close we could hear something big climbing up away from us on the slope.  We radioed for the rest of the people to come to us. When they arrived, one of the guides wanted to examine the stick that I thought was thrown. He looked at the stick and showed it to everyone else. He pointed to the mud and stains on it. The caked rim of mud and water stains showed that it had been sitting on the ground for a long time. It could NOT have just fallen off a tree from above. It must have been picked up off the ground and thrown. To be able to throw something like this, you need an arm, and a hand, and a thumb.",Along the Greenbrier River,Pocahontas County,West Virginia,Spring,Report 13083: Participant observations during BFRO WV Expedition,38.10785,-80.19044,4/9/2005,13083,Class B,dnybz1r476,72.2,56.085,39.97,38.25,0.56,0.06,0.03,0,0,,,Clear throughout the day.,9,10,93,1.57
"My husband and I attended the BFRO expedition in West Virginia in Spring of 2005. The base camp was next to a river in the mountains near the Virginia border. On Thursday afternoon most of the people crossed the river by canoe in order to hike down the trail along the opposite bank of the river.  After that group set off, Steve, my husband, headed out in his truck with a big handheld radio to see if he could reach the others who had walked down the river trail. I was alone in the base camp. After about a half hour I went outside and stood at the nose of the camper and looked up the road to see if Steve had driven away, then I turned around to go to the river.  I looked through the trees and saw what I first thought were two people from the river group coming back up the trail, around the bend in the river trail.  I walked straight over to the river's edge to get ready to take pictures of them crossing back over in the canoe. When I got to the riverbank I looked across and saw no one, which was surprising. There was no place to hide along the river trail for the next 200 yards. One side of the trail was the riverbank. The other side was the jagged rock face of the river canyon. From the ground upward, the rock face was mostly bare for about the first 15 feet. Then there was thick mountain laurel the rest of the way up, covering the rock outcroppings and ledges. You could not get out of view unless you were to climb up into the mountain laurel above the trail.  It was a near vertical climb, but there was no other way they could have vanished so quickly in any other direction. Then I started thinking about the figures I saw.  They had looked pretty slender, but it was a cold day. Everyone was bundled up for cold and rain and looked a bit “plump”.   The figures I saw seemed lanky with a lazy walk. They were also walking into the sunlight when they came around the bend, but I didn't see any color – no clothes, no light skin, no sneakers, no hats, etc.  They were tree-trunk dark. The taller one was walking closest to the hillside; the shorter one was closer to the river. Steve returned to the camp and I asked him to radio to the group that walked down the river. They had walked past that same bend and would have noticed anyone walking up the trail in the opposite direction. The river group responded and said no one passed them in the oppositive direction. They said anything coming around that bend must have come down from the side of the canyon, then climbed back up the canyon wall. They offered to walk back to that point to provide some scale, for me to compare the height. They asked me to return to where I had been standing when I saw the figures. I went back to the same spot. The river group radioed that they were coming around the bend in the trail. They said to look over at them as they came into view.  When I did it immediately struck me that they appeared much smaller than the figures I saw. There were other things about their appearance that sharply contrasted with the figures I saw. I could see the gaps of air between their arms and torso -- unlike the humans who were so bundled up with rain gear that you could not see any gaps betwen their arms and torsos. Several other things happend along this same river during the expedition. I'll let the other people who were present on the expedition describe those occurrences.",,Pocahontas County,West Virginia,Spring,"Report 11432: Possible sighting during BFRO's West Virginia expedition, Spring 2005.",38.10833,-80.17528,4/13/2005,11432,Class B,dnybz96jhe,51.97,41.05,30.13,38.7,0.82,0.78,0.16,0.0033,1,rain,,Mostly cloudy until evening.,4,6.55,83,2.02
"My father and I are both proud Mountain State natives, although we no longer reside in WV. But we do enjoy returning every spring for trout fishing and sometimes smallmouth bass fishing. My father and I have been fishing the West Fork of the Greenbrier for trout for years and also enjoy camping there. We set camp up about a 1/4 mile from a little tiny place called Wildell. Its way out in the middle of no where. Our plans were to fish and camp April 26th, 27th, 28th. The first night was quiet and we just got some sleep. The next night around the fire we just decided to try fishing on the West Fork again instead of going to another stream. We were really tired so we ate a quick dinner and went to bed. My father snores really loud so I sleep in a separate tent. I was sleeping but kept hearing noises in the background, which is normal in the woods. But I kept hearing this screaming sound waaaay off on the side of the mountain across the road (which was in front of the camp). I didnt bother me much and I just kept trying to sleep but it kept getting closer, louder, and was just constantly screaming. It got so loud and close that at one point I litterly woke up, sat up quickly in my tent and said out loud ""what the #*%# is that!?"" At that moment the sounds stopped. I dont know if it heard me say that, hear me shuffling around in the tent but for whatever reason it stopped instantly. I told my dad about it the next morning and he said he didnt hear anything. People say that bobcats and mountain lions make sounds by ""screaming"" and it could have been. I really dont know as it was pitch black outside. All I can say is that it sounded like a woman screaming as hard as she could at the top of her lungs for as long as she could and it was it was such a solid level of noise I could feel it......if that even makes sense. I've never heard anything like that. That night after a long hard day of hard fishing with little luck, we ate dinner late because we fished a different stream an we didnt get back to camp until late. We cooked hamburgers in an iron skillet over the fire. The burgers were cooked in the left over bacon grease from breakfast and it smelled and tasted delicious. We were eating our burgers about 11:00 pm when my day said ""did you hear that?"" and I replied ""I didnt hear anything."" As soon as I said that we both heard what sounded like someone yelling at the top of their lungs down by the river in a long ""hooooooOHHHHH"" yell. The river was about 500 yards away but you could hear it like they were just on the other side of the woods by our camp. It echoed a loooong ways thru the way.  I really dont know how to describe it. It was a really loud and level at first then the yell went up to an even higher pitch and it lasted about 5 or 6 seconds. At that point my dad turned to me and said ""What in the H@LL was that!?"" and I replied ""I dont know!"" We sat silently listening for another call but heard nothing. Then we thought it might have someone in trouble but we thought they would have been yelling for help or calling out someones name. Well. after a long restless night of little sleep nothing else happened. My dad and I talked about it the whole next morning. We have both never heard anything like that. It was a really loud, clear, powerful ""yell."" So after we got home my dad was telling my mom about it and she laughed and said maybe it was bigfoot. My dad and I looked at each other with surprise on our faces. So to spare you the details, I got on the internet and did some research and found this site. Not only did I find this site, but I found another report from hunters at Wildell who said they saw tracks and one hunter saw 2 ""creatures."" At this point my dad and I were a little freaked out. Then I came across the recording section on this website and listened to the recording from Snohomish County, WA and not only did my dad freak out but the hair on both my arms stood straight up and I was covered in goose bumps. That recording is EXACTLY what we heard. I have been a sportsman my whole life, even growing up fishing the mountains in WV, and I never miss a hunting season. I have heard and seen alot of things and I have NEVER heard anything like that in my life, nor has my dad. I havent told many people about this but the ones I have told it too have laughed and thought we were crazy.

"In June I was backpacking the Allegheny Trail going south bound. I had hiked up the trail following the yellow blazes. As I got to the top and started the trek along the ridge line I noticed some of the blazes getting harder to find with what looked like attempts to scratch them off. I say this because I would find the paint chips and bark at the base of the trees. It was raining on and off with a strong wind blowing West/Northwest. The trail had quit a few blow-downs and up-roots but I also would come across smaller trees broken off or up-root laying across the trail opposite the wind direction. I was hiking toward a shelter along the trail using my map book and came upon it late in the afternoon. The following morning I was awoken by a loud noise nearby. At first I could not identity the sound but then I realized it was to Flat Creek, stones being ""clacked"" together. The sound would at first be close by and then a few seconds later would be repeated farther away until it was almost out of ear shot and then it would return getting louder and louder passing by and diminishing in the other direction. It was in a north to south direction back and forth several times and then it stopped. Soon after that I felt and heard movement on the outside of the shelter and something stepped heavily on an old plastic tarp that was left spread out along the side of the shelter at that point I yelled "" get out of here"" and I did not hear any thing more. It was very unnerving.","The ""Wildell Shelter"" along the Allegheny Trail on Shavers Mountain.

"On September 28th, 2007, my good friend and I were driving home from a show. We were driving out of Shady Springs through my grandpa’s farm, and like always, were watching for deer.  This was a beautiful evening. The skies were clear with only a slight chill in the air – for it was right before dark around 6 or 6:30 in the P.M. This time we didn’t see a single deer but a HUGE “something,” standing above a hay field about 200 yards away.  It really began to catch our attention due to the fact that it was a good 4 feet taller than the fence and standing on two legs.  So, in order to get a better look at him, we stepped out of the truck.  As it started walking (definitely walking upright on two legs) we noticed that it seemed to be a brown color with fur like a grizzly bear or something to that nature.  We then turned and looked at each other and said, “Is that Bigfoot?!”  No way, we thought. My friend and I have always thought that Bigfoot was a joke and a myth so we just stood there and watched him vanish over the next ridge, not even thinking to follow him.  We then went on home telling everyone what we had seen – and yes, they all thought we were nuts!  However, my mom and my older brother had drove through their about 15 minutes earlier and she told me that when my brother had stopped to look for deer she had noticed something sitting above that hay field.  Thinking that it was just a bush or something, they drove on.  Now, I believe that whatever I had seen had been waiting on a deer to show up – for the deer are plentiful out here.  I know that what I seen wasn’t a bear or a person.   I am telling the truth and this is legitimate. Then on January 21st, 2008,  on a cloudy evening right before dark (around 6 – 6:30 P.M) my friend’s older brother, who thought we were crazy, seen something big, black, fuzzy, and walking on its hind legs about 200 yards away just directly across the road where I had seen it in September.  This road goes through the valley of two mountain sides and it has been seen on both sides.  He said he seen it for a few minutes and then it disappeared over the backside of the mountain. He then called me and told what he had seen.  He said, “I just saw Bigfoot!”  There had been a snow storm that had just passed through a couple of days before. There was snow on the ground and the temperature was in the teens.  My neighbor and I got a light and the four-wheeler and headed that way to look for tracks or any kind of sign.  When we got the top of the mountain, the wind was blowing very hard. This caused the snow to be blown around like grains of sand.  We were, however, able to find tracks that we had never seen before.  Even though the tracks weren’t perfect due to the wind, they were still very unusual – I am an avid woodsman and I have never seen tracks like that.  These tracks were narrow and about the size of a Men’s 8 ½ shoe size.  The stance of the tracks was very wide – far wider than a human. Then a few days later one of our good friends was visiting from a nearing town and he heard something he has never heard before. That night at our farm somewhere between the hours of 10 and 12, he described the noise as a short, but deep roar.  He said that even though it was far away, it was still very load.  He has never heard this before and he knows his wildlife. This next sighting has me WOWED! Since my friends and I have seen these sightings, my mom has been paying close attention to both sides of the mountain to look for that something we had been talking about.  On March 18, 2008, a partly cloudy day round 65 degrees, my mom was traveling to the local grocery store around 2 P.M.  As she was looking at the mountain side she noticed something huge and black standing on the mountain side about 200 yards away.  “I couldn’t believe what I was seeing!” she told me. This time it was on other end of the mountain where the brush is much thicker.  She then drove her Jeep Cherokee as far as she could until a gate stopped her.  She said that as she was driving her Jeep that way, the huge black creature was covering a lot of ground ON TWO LEGS – not running, but covering a lot of territory.  It first was moving horizontally with the mountain side.  This would be very hard to do for it gets really steep.  Then she said that it suddenly stopped and looked at her and then turned straight up the mountain side right into the thick brush.  She told me after that, it disappeared. So, in conclusion, there have been 3 sightings of the same huge upright creature in the same area only just a few months apart – with a total of 4 witnesses.",In Shady Spring (zip code 25918) West Virginia (Raleigh County).,Raleigh County,West Virginia,Fall,Report 23411: Multiple sightings in daylight outside Shady Spring,37.7,-81.095,9/28/2007,23411,Class A,dnwq6xh6mt,68.45,55.65,42.85,49.64,0.7,0.51,0.57,0,0,,1018.54,Mostly cloudy until afternoon.,5,7.73,319,1.96

"It was January 2005 and I was living in Job, WV with my daughter who was five years old at the time. I was renting the house which was a little ways from the road. It was about 3:30pm and I was walking down the long drive way to meet my daughter to get off the school bus. It had been snowing the night before and it was cold out with a few flurries. Well as I got to the end of the drive way the bus came and stopped and I went across the street to get my little girl off the bus and I turned around and at first was talking to my daughter I didn't look straight ahead in front of me but when I looked up I noticed a very large brown figure standing below my porch which was second story and as I walked up holding my daughter's hand it just stood there staring at first I couldn't figure out what it was I have been in WV all my life and had seen many bear, bobcats and even a cougar. So I knew this was not any of these and it was standing at least eight foot tall with man like features it had kind of a flat nose its eyes were shaped like an owls and it blinked several times it didn't move the whole time we were walking to the other side of my porch to go up the steps. In fact we even looked down on it from the upstairs porch.

"I'll be brief since this was only an audio. We were backpacking in the Otter Creek Wilderness near Elkins WV. It was the first week of Jan. '07. It was unseasonably warm. We were out for about 4 days, 3 nights. The third night we were camping by Yellow Creek. It was Saturday night at about 4 30 pm. It was starting to get dark and we were working diligently to start a fire. It had rained on and off the entire time we were there so everything was wet. As I used a small log to hammer my hatchet through another log ( splitting kindling), I heard something howling way up the hollow. It was pretty far off by my estimation and at first I mistook it for a coyote. I kept hammering away as my buddy, who works for ODNR Div of Wildlife, was talking. He hadn't heard it. I then heard it again. The same call. This time something struck me as strange. It wasn't a coyote. There are several reasons I quickly came to this conclussion. The call was long and drawn out without the typical undulations and yipping associated with a coyote. It was also very far off. If it had been a coyote, it would have had to been at least 3 or 400 lbs. to produce that kind of volume. I stopped hammering. My friend looked at me and immediately asked what I was listening for. Then we heard it a third time. It resembled the scream of a woman ( for lack of a better comparison ). It was quite long, perhaps 5 or 6 secs start to stop. It definitely resembled a primate call of sorts. Coyote have never made the hair stand up on my neck before and I can identify about every call in the woods in this part of the country. I looked at him and asked if he could tell me what we had just heard. He said he could not and we both agreed neither of us had ever heard anything like that. I have heard similar recordings on websites devoted to the north american great ape theory aka; bigfoot. He and his fiance had also taken their dogs. She hadn't heard it but the dogs had been acting strange since we arrived at that campsite, several hours earlier. At one point they were barking at what seemed to be nothing. One of the dogs hair was standing on end from the base of his tail to the back of his neck as he sniffed the wind and repeatedly barked in the upwind direction. This was about an hour before we heard the call. It was still daylight and we saw and heard nothing. It was obvious to me that whatever he was smelling was scaring him. After going to our tents for the night and the fire had burned down, I heard more noises closer to camp. It sounded as if someone was stomping around in the rotodendrin and was not trying to be quiet at all. I also heard branches snapping and they sounded pretty large. This was in the direction of Yellow Creek. Perhaps on the other side of the creek. My friends did not hear this. They somehow had gotten to sleep. This only lasted a few minutes and then ceased altogether.",Otter Creek Wilderness area around Yellow Creek. I believe the trail was called Yellow Creek Trail.

"Before I say anything more I would like to say that at the time I never considered that Sasquatch were real. I considered it all to be a hoax. I am a student studying wildlife biology. The following happen in West Virgina, Pocahontas County, near the Monongahela National Forest. MeadWestVaco owns and operates 3413 hectares in the Allegheny Mountain range for logging and ecological reseach. It is gated and not open to the public see website.  I was participating in a study project studying the distribution and breeding success of songbirds in forest cutting sites. The study was headed by West Virgina University. My job was to search for bird nest of particular species and track their progress from egg to fledge. I was familiar with every kind of bird in the area by call, as it was one of my job requirements and hobbies. I was just coming down from the top of this ridge in a clear cut area with many downed trees, slash and new growth only about waist high. I heard the strangest sound coming from above on a ridge or rock outcropping about 100 yards above. It was a ""whooping"" sound. It was very loud vocalization. Its sound was resonating through the whole valley below and carrying very far. The only sound I could match it to was a monkey call in a tropical forest (which I have never experienced). It was a very alarming call, and I assumed it was some kind of bird that I have never seen or heard before. I scanned the trees, bushes and rocky outcrop for a silhouette of a bird with my binoculars but did not spot anything. The call lasted for about 3 to 4 minutes. The ""whooping"" was repetitive, about 15  ""whoops"" and then a pause, and then 10 to 15 more about 4 sets in all. It felt like it lasted a long time. The entire time I was scanning the vegetation looking for a bird. It was so loud and deep I often thought it couldn't be a bird but it was my only conclusion. When it stopped I made my way up to the spot where It was coming from. It took me about 10 minutes to walk along logging trails and through vegetation to get there. Once I got to the summit of this ridge it flatted out. I remember seeing many game trails and beaten paths. This was common in some areas due to heavy use by deer. I started walking around looking into the trees which consisted of Eastern Hemlock and mixed hardwoods. I heard nothing. It was strangely quiet, like everything was scared off from the call. I traversed the slope very excited that I may see possibly an invasive species of bird, but when I got to the top of that ridge I felt very uneasy. I cant explain it. I never wanted to go back up to that spot after this incident. I wrote down exactly what I heard. When I went back to camp that evening, I told the ornithologists what I had heard and they said the only bird that makes such a loud and similar sound as that was a Yellow-billed Cuckoo. I listened to sound recordings of the Yellow-Billed Cuckoo that night and quickly realized that was not the sound I heard. I also called my father, an avid birdwatcher and told him about it. Then last month I watched a program on the Discovery Channel about Sasquatch.To reiterate, I was not a believer at that time and am still borderline. Watching the program peaked my interest to search online. I came across this website. I noticed that an expedition was done in almost the same spot where I had worked, just further north. I also listened to the audio recordings from  the Berry-Morehead Expeditions in the 1970's from the Sierra Nevada Mountains. When I listened to the ""Whoops and Knocks"" audio clip it was the exact call I had heard but in a different sequence. I was, and still am floored and in awe. The only thing that stops me from believing it was a Sasquatch is not knowing anything about the authenticity of that recording, but I am certain it was that same kind of ""whoop"".",Private property.

"A friend and I were out training my red-tick coon hound on Saturday Aug. 2, 2008. We drove up a familiar dirt road. We drove to the end and were on our way back when the dog had struck out of the back of the truck. I got out, turned on my mining light, and walked to the back of the truck. I opened the tailgate and let the dog loose. I stood beside the truck watching the dog sniff around in the road for a minute or so. I was shining my light around in the woods around me, when I saw a set of eyes looking at me. The eyes were a bluish green color and appeared to be 5-6 foot off the ground. I stood and watched it for at least 2-3 minutes wandering what it was. I hollered at my friend who was still sitting in the passenger side of the truck to come and look and tell me what he thought it was. We both stood there watching it, trying to figure out what it was. The creatures eyes would blink every now and then but it did not show any fear toward us or the dog. It was about 40 yards or so from us just enough so you could not see its body. We wanted to get a closer look so we decided to walk toward the creature. We only had 1 flashlight and for us to get closer we had to cross a small ditch and a broken down fence. I was trying to hold the light on the creature’s eyes, and hold the light so my friend could see so he did not fall. As we struggled to get across I noticed the eyes disappeared. We hollered for the dog to come with us and we walked approx. 40-50 yards to where the creature was standing but did not see anything. We stood there for about 5 minutes talking and letting the dog sniff around, but he acted a little nervous. We started walking back to the road. When we got back to the road we were about 60 yards from behind the truck. As we were walking back to the truck, I was hollering for my dog to come on, and I shined my light up in the woods where we left from, and the set of eyes returned. We looked at it for about 15 seconds then noticed a second pair of eyes this time, The second pair of eyes were orange- red color and seemed to be taller than the first set. At this time we were spooked and made our way swiftly to the vehicle. When we got to the vehicle, we got inside and I shined my light out the window and both sets of eyes were staring at us blinking and showing no fear. I started up my truck and hollered for my dog to come on let's go. The dog jumped in the bed of the truck, I jumped out, ran to the back, and hooked the dog up. I ran and got back in the truck, I shined the light out the window on the creatures, still staring at us, and my red-tick coon hound seen the creatures standing in the woods and started barking with every breath. The creatures continued to stare at us blinking and showing no fear. We decided it was time to get going. We started driving down off the hill. We drove a couple hundred yards and the dog was still barking with every breath. From the way the dog was acting, I felt they were following us. I shined my light uphill beside me and sure enough, there they stood. I watched both of them follow us for about 1/2 mile.","dirt road on a mountain, far from civilization, doesn't see much traffic",Randolph County,West Virginia,Summer,Report 24494: Possible nighttime encounter while raccoon hunting outside Valley Head,38.55,-79.98,8/2/2008,24494,Class B,dnz5k1b64b,79.81,67.81,55.81,63.03,0.83,,0.05,0.0188,1,rain,,Heavy rain in the morning.,0,,239,2.19
"This took place in the late summer of 2002. I was walking the property next to mine as logging interested me in how it worked and how the land looked afterward. I'd go onto the place after the workers left for the day at 3PM. It was rather hot and plain nasty so I usually headed out after 4 -5 PM. This day they were at the far end of the valley (or ""holler"" as the locals call it-I'm from CA originally). I was armed as there are wild dogs, bears, and a black panther running round back here.  Walking to the far end there are two smaller branches off to your right, the first is shallow and only extends a few yards. Every time I walked to base of the hill before, I felt like I just didn't want to venture into the woods. I had found another way onto the ridge above on the right a few months before-but I also got pretty badly spooked and kind of stayed away. I had trails and just went wherever-until the loggers hit this patch. The past few weeks before this I had roamed all over the logging trails and as soon as they got back there I began to feel very uneasy. Walking alone, I decided to keep looking around staying extra cautious. This day I went left and followed a trail that took me to the ridge top which is dead center of the valley. I also had a very ""something is watching me"" feeling so I wasn't what you would call happy, just taking note of where things were and enjoying the view. The trail followed along this ridge and would take me near where I had all the strange feelings. I stopped as the feeling of being watched was getting a bit too much when I heard a tree fall, just on the other side of the ridge not more than about maybe seventy yards away. I was wondered just why in the hell would a tree fall but something told me not to investigate and to get off that hill. I decided to turn around to call it a day. I walked maybe ten yards when something loped between two trees on the ridge to my right. My first thought was some loggers or forestry guys were still on the property. It looked to be wearing Carhart brown clothes. I went maybe twenty more yards and then it hit me: I had been on that ridge a few days before, I knew where those trees were and if, IF it was a man he had to be around seven to eight feet tall. A day or two later I went back to the ridge where I saw the thing and took a good look. I never felt any real strangeness on this side and didn't then, but I did confirm that whatever I saw was very big. I also could swear I saw the right arm and leg but not the head, thinking back it was kind of leaning forward as it walked along so the head was behind the tree when I noticed it.","At Pennsboro, WV follow 74 North for approximately 4 miles.",Ritchie County,West Virginia,Summer,Report 26279: Logging reveals a brief sighting of a bipedal creature near Pennsboro,39.355,-80.915,8/13/2002,26279,Class B,dnyrysr7rz,94.61,81.105,67.6,63.97,0.67,0.24,0.18,,,rain,1018.43,Mostly cloudy in the morning.,9,6.87,174,2.93

We turned around and high tailed it back to the spot. The sighting took place at the Hinton exit. There is a visitor's center off to the left. We went to the road she saw them and parked. I got out and looked around and within a minute I spotted the group. It consisted of 2 large and 2 smaller. The larger appeared to be at least 7 to 8 foot tall. The smaller ones were 2 foot smaller. They were solid black in color. The group was approximately 150ft away, towards the top of a small hill. The 2 larger were standing up hill from the 2 smaller ones sitting. The group was moving back and forth. The 2 larger would squat then stand back up again, at least 4 times. I then made a howling noise and the largest one began to sway back and forth between 2 trees. He looked like a gorilla at the zoo holding the bars and going back and forth. I howled again and he moved downhill towards one of the smaller ones and bent over near it. There was enough light behind them for me to see arms and legs and what appeared to be a huge upper body on the largest one. The reach I saw between trees had to be at least 6ft. My fiancée was very scared and said we need to go. We got back in the car and moved about 20ft. and I saw more movement. We stopped again and I got out and saw 1 of the larger ones walk over the hill. Then I saw one of the smaller ones stand up. We left at that point.

"I was hunting West Virginia's late antler-less deer season in the Canaan Valley National Wildlife Refuge when the sighting occurred. I had gotten to the area shortly after 3:00pm that evening, and after parking my vehicle in the ""Camp 70"" parking area I hiked up what appeared to be an old logging trail directly behind the parking area. I had already gotten a late start and wanted to get afield as quickly as possible, so I decided to stalk along the logging trail until I got further into the river bottom. After hunting the trail for roughly 30 minutes I was able to see a long distance in the river bottom to my right, so I decided to move into the bottom in hopes a deer would emerge from the thick along the river at dusk. I came across another ""road"" after leaving the logging trail, so I started walking further into the valley on it. The road was frozen and crusted over due to the cold temperatures, which made traveling quietly impossible, so after a short distance I found a small group of trees a few yards from the trail and set up in them. Shortly after arriving I heard what sounded like brush breaking 150 - 200 yards below me, towards the river. I readied myself in hopes it was a group of deer moving into the flats to feed, but nothing appeared. A few minutes passed by and I heard the sound again, and again, nothing materialized. I decided to move closer, and positioned myself in another group of small trees 100 yards or so below my first site. I had been in this grove of saplings for 5 - 10 minutes when I caught movement in a cluster of trees that was about 80 - 90 yards below me and to the left. I could see the movement with my naked eye, and immediately upon seeing it I scoped the group of trees and to my surprise saw nothing. A few minutes went by and I caught the movement again, I quickly scoped the trees, and this time I was shocked by what I saw. At first I thought it was a large man, as the first thing I saw through my scope was a vague silhouette, but when my eyes focused I could see what appeared to be a primate-like creature standing upright and staring directly at me. It only broke it's stillness to slightly move the upper portion of it's body in an up and down motion. It would bend it's knees as if it was going to sit down, then immediately straighten back up. This went on for what seemed to have been over a minute, then the creature exited the group of tree's and moved to my left (the creature's right), towards the mountain behind me. It walked across an expanse of river basin that I would guess to be 70 - 80 yards long before entering the timber and exiting my field of view. It kept watching me the whole time it was walking, only breaking it's stare on me a few times to look directly ahead of it. I initially thought of attempting to locate it's track's, but my nerves got the best of me and I started moving towards the parking lot as quickly as I could. Though the creature never actually made any threatening movements, I didn't feel safe enough to continue hunting and remain in the valley any longer after the sun went down than I had to. I immediately left the area and had no further incidents on the way to my vehicle.","I do not know the name of the road that leads to this area of the refuge, though it is easy to find.

"I was out for a ride on road bicycle and had to stop on the side of the road to take a nature break. The section of road where I took my break had woods on both sides of the road. The right side of the road where I was stopped at was at the base of a banked hill. The opposite side of the road dropped down into a valley where a creek ran through it. There were no houses close in the area, and I was really out in the country. As I was taking my break all the sudden this rock goes flying across the road in the air about 15 ft off to my right shoulder. I just caught it going through the air out of the corner of my eye. I turned just in time to look across the road and see it land on the other side of the road. I looked up the hill to see who could have been throwing it, but could not see anyone. The hill had a very steep slope to it and most of the leaves had fallen off the trees, so it was easy to see deep into the woods. Getting a weird feeling I finished my business, and got back on the pedals and left the area. I heard no sounds, nor did I did smell any orders.

My cousin and I were sitting on the hill next to our storage building smoking a cigarette and looking down into the holler next to the road. All of a sudden we heard something move down over the hill so I whispered ""shush, if we’re quiet we may see a deer."" We continued to sit there, about 2 min, until a car came down the hill and its lights flashed on something tall standing near the bottom. It turns to its side quickly then looks up the hill towards us.

"Just two nights ago,( 2/16/09) my brother who lives up the hollow from my house called a little after 8 p.m. to say he had seen something outside in his yard. It seemed to be turned in the direction of his chicken house, at an angle to him, where it could keep a lookout both toward his house and the driveway which passes on up further into the hollow where there is another house. I have another brother that lives right across the driveway from the first brother. This brother says that two nights (2/14/09) before my brother saw what he did, he thought he saw something standing at the end of my 1st brother's screened in porch, my second brother was smoking on his screened in porch, and when he opened his screen door to get a better look, my 1st brother's pole light (which has a short in it) went out, and he couldn't see anything at all in that direction then. A few years ago, a third brother and neighbor to these other brothers, was walking in the dark without a light to my 2nd brother's house, and something screamed like a woman at him, and terrified him. This is a man standing 6' tall and over 300 lbs. My 1st brother is also 6' tall and over 300 lbs, and the creature he saw was taller and weighed more than he did. But he said it didn't seem to be fat. It had reddish brown fur-hair. He did not see the facial features due to the profile stance the creature was in and he said that it seemed to be aware that it, my brother yelled out loud, ""What the heck is that!"" and ran toward his front door that opens to his screened porch, he said that he felt the creature heard him and knew it had been observed and when he went to the front door and stepped out on the screened in porch, it was gone. The dogs didn't show up until my brother yelled for them. I myself have had a couple of things happen to me, that at the time they happened were unexplained but now I wonder if they are not related. Last fall my daughter and myself were leaving her house, she lives at the bottom of my hill near the creek, when something that screamed like a women terrified us. Then I heard what sounded like someone hit the side of my house under the breezeway where my bedroom is located, and I have had what sounded to me like a man walking across my house again over where my bedroom is located and in a minute or two it retraced its steps.

"There are three encounters that I have had not in the physical or in another words I did not have a visual sighting but had heard weird behavior in the woods. To begin with I am a 40 year responsible adult male and I have not told anyone about these encounters or experiences that I have had for fear of being ridiculed and/or being labeled as loony by my friends, family and the community. I found this website many years ago on my own by accident and was surprised to read about others who had the same experiences as I had. I finally found the courage to tell you what had happened to me. I have been in and lived near the woods all my life. In my family hunting is a tradition. All the animal noises and natural sounds of the woods I know and am familiar with and have honed over time a very acute sense and perception that most hunters have or any outdoors man would have honed. I would go sqirrel hunting often after work along some railroad tracks that ran just a quarter of a mile from my home at the time. One late fall afternoon I was just walking with my .22 mag rifle at the ready quietly along the tracks when I heard a noise or a rustling of leaves in the woods when I suddenly stop and stood motionless while I scanned the woods with my eyes looking for the source of the noise thinking it my be a large gray or fox squirrel. After awhile I did not hear nothing more so I moved on. Now I have hunted alone many times and had never been afraid of anything but just after I had moved on I began to hear what sounded like foot steps in the woods just behind me and parelling me 50 to 75 ft. away. At first I thought of deer or a dog or a person walking up in the woods and after a few minutes I decided to call out to who ever may be there and let them know that I was where I was there for safety precautions. Well there was no reply and I called out a couple more times just to be sure. No reply. So as it was about 1/2 hour before sunset I was compelled to call it quits for that day and head back to my truck which was parked about a mile back near the RR. Whatever it was proceeded to follow me keeping pace with me at a parallel distance of 50 ft. It became more and more clear that what ever it was was heavy and big for several times along the way back I heard loud heavy branches breaking and heavy footfalls that I know could not have been a deer or bear (there has not been a bear seen in the area that I was hunting for as long as I can remember nor have I had ever found any sign of one in that area.). Every time I would stop it would stop and when I moved it moved this when on until I came to the area near where my truck was parked and was an opened field. Whatever it was followed me right up to where the wood line was about to end and the field begin. The other encounter happened in the same area only a year or two later and this time the unknown animal was shadowing me on the other side of the tracks between the tracks I was on and the river. There was a heavy growth of rhododendron bushes that ran the entire length of the shelf of land that was about 50 yards wide from the river to the tracks. There is an embankment that is an accent of 75 ft. from the rhododendron bushes to the tracks above where I was at. I could see the wake that this thing was making from time to time through the rhododendron bushes for it was right in the middle of them as it was keeping up with me, which was remarkable to me how it did that without exposing itself in some manner, but again I thought through all the possibilities of what it could be for there are few animals that would follow you for a mile stopping and starting in sync with your every step. I never saw any part of it as it moved through the brush and even though I could see a wake made by the branches as it moved through the thick brush it was only here and there, mostly it was if a large contortionist where moving through the heavy with the brush with the utmost of ease. The third time was near spruce knob in Pocahontas County, WV while on a field trip for a summer class I was taking in the spring of 2003 some of my fellow classmates and I were outside one night trying to call in Bard Owls. After some minutes later we heard a few in the pine trees near our camp returning our calls. We were having fun with our success with calling them in and after 30 minutes we had called in 4 or 5 more in the pine trees that bordered the road across the road from our camp. Then all of a sudden while in the act of making more calls we heard a huge commotion up on the hill about 75 yards. from us it sounded like a couple of huge guys romping around and making the Bard Owl call, we all stood there trying to make out what it was but could not see anything. Someone shined a flashlight in the direction of the sounds and they ceased immediately. We did night hear anything more on that hill that night. I do not know for sure what it could have been but would not rule out that it could have been a bigfoot.","Northeast of Morgantown, WV",Monongalia County,West Virginia,Spring,Report 15475: Hunter describes being paralleled along railroad tracks northeast of Morgantown,39.6716,-79.9442,5/10/2003,15475,Class B,dpp1svfrv4,70.09,67.46,64.83,63.78,0.91,0.85,0.3,0.0312,1,rain,1010.99,Rain in the morning and afternoon.,6,6.84,197,3.94
"It was Thanksgiving night of 2003 at around 11:30pm. I had taken a friend of mine home and was driving back on route 50 near Burlington, WV (that's in Mineral Co.) I came around a turn and slammed on my brakes to avoid hitting what I thought might be a very large dog. I barely missed hitting it and as soon as I stopped I realized that this was definitely not a dog. It was too big. It was on the right side of the road, crossing to the left. It was black and walking on all fours, its front legs were longer than the back legs. I was petrified. I had no idea what it was. When it got to the left side of the road it turned and looked at me, its eyes were glowing orange in my headlight. I couldn't even scream. I had chills all over and tears were rolling out of my eyes. I sped home which was about 4 miles away and ran into my house. I was hysterical and crying and I woke up my mother and told her about it. She believed me. Other people didn't believe me and I was made fun of. I referred to it as a ""black demon"" basically because I didn't know what it was. I can't drive by that place in the dark to this day without thinking of that creature and praying that I never see it again and if I do that someone will be with me.

"First of all thank you for taking my story.  I watch your program often and find them very enjoyable. I was born in Clay County Kentucky and have lived in several states since: Ohio, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and now in West Virginia.  My story takes place  while living on the Kentucky and West Virginia border in 2008. The Coal industry is a very important part of the economy in that area. Underground mining requires battery operated equipment due to the exhaust of internal combustion engines. I was working for a company that rebuilt the batteries that ran the equipment. These batteries weighed one hundred to one hundred and fifty pounds each. I picked up some batteries for one of the mines in our area and started on my route. I went to Charleston West Virginia and turned down route #5, which led  me into a very rural area. The road went from black top to gravel and then to dirt. It was about 5:00 P.M. and being in the fall of the year the day began to wane and evening began to fall. I had my head lights on as I made my way along the dirt road. I was traveling at about fifteen miles per hour and was going along a small river that ran along on my left.  I rounded a turn and found a low water bridge crossing the stream. A low water bridge is made of some pipe that allows the water to flow through them and concrete is poured over them to make a roadway. These are always one lane wide and usually close to the water. Lining up with the bridge I noticed three of four deer off to my right along with some birds and on the left side of the bridge was a bear. I have seen many bear down where I worked but only black bears, some three to four hundred pounds. This one however was brown and very shaggy!  I thought, how odd, I’ve never seen a brown bear in that area and certainly not one that big. It was sitting on its haunches looking down into the water. I had the window about half way down on my drivers side as I approached it. As I got closer I thought, “That's not a bear!” When I got to within about five yards of it, it stood up and turned to look at me. It must have been at least eight feet tall and four feet wide at the shoulders and no neck that I could see. I have never been this close to an animal that size in my life. It was a brindle color, brown, black and gray all mingled together. It’s head was kind of pointed and no hair on its face which looked almost human. It didn’t look angry or threatening, just kind of interested in my being there. The hair, several inches long,  hung down from its arms and it’s hands were almost to its knees. Bears don’t have front legs like that, I should know, I’ve seen enough of them fairly close up  and they sure don’t have hands! As I drove by, it looked down at me in my pick up and  I realized just how large it was. I was within five feet of it and I was maybe going three to five miles per hour as I passed it. There was no foul smell that I can remember and I have heard that that seems to come with them. Approaching the end of the bridge I looked in my outside mirror and it turned and stepped off the bridge into what must have been four feet of water which didn’t even come to its waist. I remember saying to myself, “That wasn’t a bear!” I watched as it crossed the stream and climbed up the opposite bank with a hand over hand motion, holding onto trees as it went. Coming back that way after my delivery, it was dark and I saw no sign of it anywhere.  Several years have gone by and I am now 71 years old. I had not told anyone about what I saw until recently. I shared my story with my father in law and told him I would understand if he didn’t believe me. But to my surprise he had worked in that area and said, “There’s something down there people claimed to have seen for years.” ____________________________________ Note from Matt Moneymaker: I discussed the bridge location with Russ Jones.

"As we were driving...I was watching closely at the roads and conditions, because my wife was driving and I was a bit nervous about that! As we were traveling north on I-77 near the 150 milemarker (I looked after the incident!)...I noticed something up ahead on the right hillside. It was a fairly steep, snow-covered hillside. I thought I saw something that looked like a very big man walking on this steep hill.

"It was the summer of 1983 or 84 and I was working for a company during the summer months trying to pay my way through college.  I worked 58 hours a week so I had little time to do anything else besides work.  I had purchased a tent and decided to go camping one Saturday night (it was in August as best I can remember).  Because of the hours I worked, this was the only night I could go camping (I also went to church on Sundays but I had plenty of time to get up and make it to church – service did not start until 10:00 AM). After arriving home from work on the Saturday (date not known exactly) I planned to go camping on, I packed my backpack with all the necessary items for the short stay including my new tent.  I left the house and hiked the mile or so to the area where I planned to camp.  Also, my dog accompanied me.  He was a fairly large collie dog weighing about 80 pounds.  This dog was very intelligent and to my knowledge was not afraid of any animal (this is an important fact to this incident).  I had never seen him back down from a fight. The area was forest (a mix of pine and eastern hardwoods) and consisted of 1,050 acres.  I knew this area well because I had hunted it for approximately 4 years.  I also hunted a farm directly adjacent to this property which consisted of 450 acres.  This area is surrounded by old farmland as well as other stretches of forested land.  I made camp on top of a ridge that was relatively flat for the area. After setting up my tent and camp, I made a fire pit (It was the dry months and I did not want to start a forest fire) and started a small fire to cook on. At approximately 9:30 PM I turned in for the night.  At around 10:00 PM I was awakened by an “animal” call I had never heard before.  I can only describe the sound by saying it was big and had the lung capacity of a lion or an elephant.  It literally shook the forest and my chest. I have pretty much heard everything there is to hear in the eastern forests (life long hunter and geologist – I have literally spent years in the woods) and this was so completely different there was nothing at the time I could compare it to (recently, I heard the male gorilla recording that was posted on the BFRO web site and it sounded eerily similar). At first I was unsure of what I heard because I was half asleep.  The first time I heard the call it came from about 20 yards off to my left.  15 seconds later I heard the same thing directly behind my tent still about 20 yards off.  By this time I am setting up putting on my pants and boots.  Again, about 15 seconds later, I heard the same call off to the right of my tent about 20 yards off.  My hair was literally standing on end.  At this point, I was somewhat concerned that I was not hearing my dog bark or growl.  He was sleeping outside the tent and appeared to have left.  I grab an eight inch hunting knife and a wimpy flashlight I had with me.  When I pulled the tent flap back to shine the flashlight on whatever was making the noise, I noticed my dog backing up with his tail between his legs, the hair on the nape of his neck sticking straight up growling just barely audible. He could see what was making the noise but I was unable to make out any thing besides trees with the flashlight I had.  Whatever was out there, the dog kept his eyes on it.  I believed to this day that dog would have protected me to the death.  As I have already stated the hair on my body was standing on end and I was extremely afraid (I am 6’ 1”,  220 lbs and don’t scare too easily).  I believe whatever was making the sound was doing so in a threatening manner. I left all my gear and only took the knife and flashlight for protection as I hiked the mile back out of the woods.  My dog constantly looked back.  He walked beside me the whole way out and would not leave my side.  I had to cross a couple of fields and I never saw anything following us but there were also stands of trees that ran beside the fields in the direction my dog was looking. After church the next day, I went back and got all my gear and it was exactly like I had left it.  There was also food that was left untouched.  I scouted the area for tracks but found none.  As already stated, I was in thick woods and there was a heavy covering of leaves and such.",Edited out at request of witness.,Jackson County,West Virginia,Summer,Report 14037: Possible stalking and vocalizations near Frozen Camp,38.8317,-81.5784,5/16/2006,14037,Class B,dnvuzth7j9,60.83,55.56,50.29,48.33,0.89,0.95,0.61,0.0008,1,rain,,Overcast throughout the day.,5,3.09,229,4.67

"I live in a very rural area of McDowell Co. West Virginia. It is not unusual to see bear, coyote, deer, etc. on a weekly basis around my home. I am an avid hunter/outdoorsman, and I have seen and heard (up to this incident) everything the woods of West Virginia have to offer. On July 23, 2009 I was setting on my front porch area of my residence (I had built a fire) at approx. 11:30p.m when I heard a loud ""scream"" from 150-200 yards away. My dogs immediately began barking in the direction of the noise. I assumed it was a mountain lion. I listened intently for a few more minutes but I heard nothing else. After about fifteen/twenty minutes, I heard something walking through the wood line directly across the road from my house. The crashing brush led me to believe that it was a large animal, possibly a bear. At exactly 12:15 a.m (fifteen minutes after midnight) I heard a loud roar or moan come from across the road from my house, approximately 300 yards from my house. The animal then proceeded to moan again, however this time, I also heard a growl. After the second moan, I then heard what I can only describe as a series of moaning howls. The howls sent a cold chill up my spine. I am avid hunter, and I know that the animal responsible for these noises had to be extremely large, at least 800-1000 lbs. I went inside and locked my doors. I am confident it was not a coyote, bear, mountain lion, cow, etc. This animal had a distinct, powerful moan that could never have been made by any of these animals.","The area is very rural, steep mountainous terrain.

"My friend Corey and I decided to go bow hunting one day is the fall of October of 2009 in the mountains behind our houses. We came to a big brush pile which we couldn't be seen from the direction were headed. We had thought we saw someone else that was hunting coming our way from the direction we couldn't be seen but the closer it got the more unusual it got. It was walking about 50 yards below us and when we finally got a good look at it we could see it was a bigfoot. It was about 8-10 feet tall, fur from head to toe, and was extremely thick and muscular. We watched in amazement as it walked for about 100 yards until it was out of sight. We told all our friends about it and got interest from them as well. We went back the next weekend with 6 of us in total at about the same time we saw it. We went to the same path it was travelling and kept hearing something in the distance on the same path ahead of us so we decided to try and track it in two separate groups. On the path we found 2 separate footprints that were human like but huge. We also kept hearing something ahead of us the entire time. We got to the top of the mountain ridge when the sun was starting to set and while we were talking all 6 of us saw the bigfoot heading down the other side of the ridge.",Horne Waldron Rd take a left off the bridge and its about 1-2 houses down on the right in the mountains behind it.,McDowell County,West Virginia,Fall,Report 63863: Bow hunters observe a bigfoot in daylight near Bradshaw,37.34592,-81.8074,10/15/2009,63863,Class A,dntu6qtev2,61.7,53.41,45.12,51.14,0.92,0.71,0.92,0.0107,1,rain,,Rain throughout the day.,4,6.663,81,2.38
"On a hot summer evening between July-August 2006, I had the window of the bedroom open. I heard ""very close"" moaning or howling from our open bedroom window of our home around 3:45 in the morning. The howling and noise woke me from a sound sleep. I could not get my husband awake who was sound asleep at this time, I tried quietly. The howling or moaning at first sounded like that of another type of animal in pain (more like a large pig or cow at first) but changed to sound like something ""very large"" in size and getting very upset (VERY deep, angry tone growls). I did some research before contacting you and I have heard what bear sound like on various recordings. As well as, other type of animal recordings. This animal in no way sounded like that of a bear or anything else I have heard in the past. Finding your web site and listening to the recordings of moaning and such brought chills up my back!!! They sound so familiar to that night but I still cannot be certain. We have a small spaniel mix dog that sleeps in our basement garage area located under our home. Upon hearing the howling outside that night, the dog moved to the garage door area located directly under the bedroom window and barked like being startled from sleep three times. I could tell, the creature I had heard moaning and howling moved to the garage door under our open bedroom window (which is two stories high) and growled ""very deep"" at our barking dog while ""striking or smacking"" above the garage door. The dog STOPPED barking! Then I heard nothing out of our dog or from the animal outside the window again that night. I was too frightened to move and look outside. For a long time prior to this I had a strange unexplained feeling of ""being watched"" while being outside on our homes patio. This patio faces pretty dense wooded area on three angles back there. Something just made me feel uncomfortable even in daylight hours out there that I had not felt before since moving here. Although a bit odd, I no longer have this same feeling. On two different nights prior, I couldn't sleep and heard what sounded like small rocks hitting the brick outside of our home close to our bedroom area. I assumed it was just the home settling while the temperature was cooling down in the late evenings. We live in a pretty dark (not much light in this area at all) heavily wooded and somewhat quiet area just outside of town. We have several deer, turkey, rabbits, squirrel and other small game that roam throughout our woods and property.","Southern Mercer county WV, not far from VA state line.

"So much time has elapsed since this incident, so I am not sure of exact dates and times, so those aspects will be approximations.  However, I DO remember EXACTLY what I saw. It was approximately 9pm, and it was dark and cold.  I believe it was around Thanksgiving.  My girlfriend lived, at that time, on Green Mountain, about 6 miles outside of Keyser, WV.  The area is hilly to mountainous and I will enclose a mapquest picture of the area (although it has changed a bit since the picture was taken).  It is technically Rt. 46/4, and the sighting occured along this route, what is  now known as Green Mountain Road locally, but older maps may list it as ""Hoover Hollow Road"". I was returning home after dropping her off.  I was alone and beginning my descent back down the mountain, at approximately the halfway point. The road changes levels several times in a short distance at this point; many dips and slight rises before the meat of the descent begins.  I was in this section and on one of the rises when something on the left side of the road caught my attention.  There appeared to be someone sitting on a log on the bank above the road; the ""person"" looked at me and I realized it wasn't a person at all.  The motion of the creature-- for lack of a better term-- indicated that I had startled it-- very sharp, quick movements.  The eyes glowed yellowish/amber as my lights hit them; the being had long brownish fur with strands of white (maybe) through it; it appeared matted, or dreadlocked; the feature that struck me most was the size of the thing-- I can't even imagine the actual numbers but, I have a 300 pound Brother-in-law and a 6'3"" tall Brother and they both would have been dwarfed by this guy, both in height and weight.  I would conservatively estimate the creature to have been at least 400lbs and every bit of 7 feet tall.  Upon seeing my car, this creature stood up and jumped from the bank, landing somewhere near the middle of the 2 lane road, and began to run from left to right, into a deep pine and laurel thicket. I do not know why, but I stopped near the point that the creature entered the thicket and turned my vehicle off.  My windows were rolled down slightly, so I could hear the thing running through the thicket-- the sound receded quickly, as if it was moving with considerable speed.  I listened for mere seconds, before recognizing the stupidity of my actions forced my hand and I continued on. As I drove on, I saw what appeared to be a fire burning directly ahead of me.  The road bends to the right and the fire was actually on the same side of the road as the point where I observed the creature.  Around the fire, I saw several people.  They were talking and partying.  To me, it appeared that the spot where the creature was sitting was a PERFECT observation point for the happenings at the campfire.  And, I remembered him (I say ""him"" because I got the distinct impression of masculinity from this enormous creature-- barrel chest, thick arms and legs and just a ""maleness"" to it's movements) turning his head to face me and it turned in a way to suggest that it was looking TOWARD the clearing where the fire was burning.  I remember thinkin, ""Huh...  He just wanted to see what they were doing"". I immediately called my girlfriend after observing the campfire.  I told her that I think I just saw a Bigfoot, and I related what I saw.  She panicked and told me to come get her, but I was too spooked by then to turn around.","I have a mapquest image of the area and I labeled it with some approximate points from the incident.

"I would like to preface this report with a small fact: I have always wanted to see a Bigfoot.  I truly believe that I have, based on what i saw tonight. I work for a monitoring lab that conducts late-night bat surveys.  Very recently we were commissioned to do a survey to look for Myotis sodalis, the Indiana bat.  We had to make sure that the bats were not roosting on an active mine site. On the second night of our 6-day survey, my coworker and I were going to check one of the nets when we heard a very loud whooping howl nearby (within 30 feet of where we were standing).  It was late at night, probably around 1:30 in the morning.  At first I thought the sound was a person, trying to scare us by making howling noises.  After the creature vocalized a second time, however, i knew the noise wasn't made by a man.  I refused to move from my spot, scanning the tree line with my light.  I didn't see anything then, but i heard rustling in the woods of something large moving. The next night i was on a different part of the survey, but 2 more of my coworkers were in the same area i was in the night before.  They told us at the end of our shift that they had heard noises in the woods, and saw a place that had been trampled down by something much larger than a deer or bear. Finally, on the last night of our survey, I was back in the area i heard the noise on the second day.  I was in a good mood, because i hadn't heard any strange noises since that first one.  As i went to check the nets with 2 of my coworkers at around 2:30 in the morning (in the same area as before) I heard a single, high-pitched ""whoop"".  I  jumped but was prepared, and shone my light in the direction of the noise.  about 40 yards in front of us, a large bipedal creature crossed the road.  It was tall, probably around 7 feet, and was completely covered in short, coarse-looking black hair except for its face, which was brown.  The creature looked at the 3 of us as it crossed the road, took two steps, and was gone up the embankment on the other side. The 3 of us ran back to my truck, where one of my coworkers grabbed a machete.  When my boss and another technician showed up, the 5 of us walked to where I had seen the Bigfoot.  In the mud were 2 distinct footprints, each much larger than any of our shoes.  in the direction that the Bigfoot had walked in was trampled down grasses and broken twigs, as if something very big had moved quickly through the brush.  We promptly packed up our nets and left, all of us were extremely scared.  I plan on going back soon and trying to extract as much evidence as I can find.",[location details edited: a surface mine in Boone County],Boone County,West Virginia,Summer,Report 15355: Early morning sighting by bat survey crew,38.2128,-81.70641,7/29/2006,15355,Class A,dnvcksrjww,80.61,74.715,68.82,69.26,0.85,0.73,0.14,0,0,,1017.34,Mostly cloudy throughout the day.,5,7.75,219,0.97
"It was back in probably the early 1970's, Spring time, late at night (around midnight).  I was out riding down this road that had a farm on one side and an apple orchard on the other.  As I was driving there was some movement about two hundred yards in front of me going across the roadway from the farm to the orchard.  When the object got to the middle of the road it turned its head and looked in my direction, at this time I got a real good look at it, about 8 to 9 feet tall very heavy build, long lanky arms, long dark red hair, very long stride (about two and a half steps to cross road).  If I was to guess his weight, it would have been around 4 to 5 hundred pounds.  I was on a road with very little traffic (I was the only vehicle on the road at that time).  I got to admit, I was not a bigfoot believer until that night.  I didn't tell anyone about this because I knew they would not believe me.  I was one of the chief officers in our local fire department at the time and I didn't want people to think I was nuts.  Oh by the way, I did get close enough to see what it was or wasn't.

"I am a carpenter, self-employed; at times my job will be many miles away from my home. When I take one of these it fits my life style perfectly because I enjoy camping, so there is a perfectly good reason to be in my favorite place the great outdoors. This summer while at my tent home there was many times this strange sound could be heard. It was not like any I had heard before. The sound would awaken me, always after midnight. My camp sight was in a low part of a meadow. When I was awakened by the moans, I noticed the sound was one following the next ( moannnnnnn -- 1234-- moannnnnnn --- 1234 --- moannnnnnnn. The long hours I worked kept me from looking for any tracks, the weather had been very dry this summer. The camp was hidden under four trees in which had low hanging branches. Near by perhaps three hundred yards was a large forest. One day I went down a near by road which took me to the Tygart Valley River, nearly two miles away from camp. This was new to me. The forest and large rocks were on both sides of the road. There were no sounds during the day. A number of times there would be walking sounds near camp at night.

"I work for a tribal government in Wyoming and it is not every day we hear of things that go on in the community such as these sightings.  Over the years there have been reports of bigfoots and they were neither investigated or had anyone interested in really going out and finding the truth.  These sightings of this creature have been linked to various beliefs as well in the culture. About 15 years ago many thought the sightings of this creature, or this spirit, was a bad sign or warning.  Today, after many years I am again hearing about several co-workers seeing it in the same area. A river runs nearby as well as perfect willow patches and tree areas where something could hide. A bigfoot was sighted in broad daylight and persons were telling about it at the Health Fair about a month ago in May 2007.  I heard of this from some colleagues who would not make something up or embellish it. Another incident happened a week after the Health Fair. My co-worker has a girlfriend he lives with who took her sister home about midnight in the area of where a rodeo grounds and many trees are located.  She took her sister home on a dirt road and then they sighted the hairy big creature in front of their car lights walking on the road. They had no other way around it or any way to turn around and the creature stopped and turned to face them directly.  It was very frightening to them. I had a sighting on the reservation many years ago when I was a teenager. I had to open a gate near the highway where I live in Crowheart.  I was 15 at the time and I am now 41.  I seen in a snow blizzard a tall hairy man that walked rapidly across the road.  He was huge. It happened so fast it was almost unreal.  As anyone else can tell you the hair stands up on your neck, you get cold clammy hands, and your stomach flips over, and it seems like an eternity if the creature looks directly at you.  Now again last night on May 30, 2007, my co-worker states his mother seen something near their house which is in an area with lots of trees.  It seems it is hanging around near their home and perhaps they will catch it on camera phone or digital.  Meanwhile there may be others that have not yet come forth in this area.  Also, I know there must be some validity to this and someone could discover a very real creature since the sightings are becoming more frequent.","Along the US Hwy 287 on the route to Yellowstone National Park, near the Wind River Mountain Range",Fremont County,Wyoming,Spring,Report 19472: Late day and early morning sightings near the Wind River Mountain Range,42.9919,-108.9245,5/31/2007,19472,Class A,9xds967tgp,61.15,53.63,46.11,35.01,0.56,0.25,0.48,0,0,,1013.31,Mostly cloudy starting in the evening.,11,10,43,3.12

"My brother-in-law and I decided to go hunting on the last weekend of hunting season. We went to our camping spot that we have gone to for over 20 years and set up camp. This was on Friday night. The next day was uneventful and we were both tired so we went to sleep about 8 PM. Sometime later in the evening, I awoke to very loud screaming and some sort of yelling that I have never heard before in all my years of being in the wilderness. The screaming lasted about 20 to 30 seconds, stopped for about 20 seconds, then started again. This happened 3 times. I finally got my brother-in-law to wake up and he heard about 4 or 5 seconds of the third time. We were both very tired and he fell back asleep in seconds. It was really quiet. You could not hear anything. I could not go back to sleep after that. I laid in my sleeping bag inside the tent for about 30 to 40 minutes with dead silence in the forest. When I was just starting to doze off again, I heard footsteps entering our camp. I heard the footsteps, which were not of a 4 legged animal, walk past my side of the tent. It walked around the entire tent and I saw a shadow on the end of the tent about 5 feet high. With the moon being up in the sky, whatever cast the shadow had to have been taller than 5 feet. It circled the tent and walked by my side again. It stopped at the other end of the tent and scratched the material like it was trying to figure out what the material was. It walked away from the tent after that and went across the gravel road. I could hear the gravel under its feet. After it crossed the road, it went into the woods. After a minute or so, I heard the sound of 2 sticks hitting together about 15 to 20 times. Nothing else happened for the rest of the night. The next morning, we got up and I told my brother-in-law what else had happened during the night.

"I was driving northbound on route 146. I was driving with my sister (the only other person in the car) and she was looking down at her I-Pod and was in the front passenger seat. The traffic was average not too many cars but a few, and I was doing about 65-68 mph.  I looked about 3/4 of a mile ahead and saw something off to the rightside of the highway not on the highway but near the woodline on the grass. At first it looked like someone possibly in a gilley suit but then as I got closer I couldn't believe my eyes because it looked just like what you hear about and see artist renderings of a bigfoot like creature. It was too tall to be a person in a suit approx. 7-8ft tall and very broad with black hair. I couldn't see any specific facial features or chest features as it turned into the woods when i was about 1/8 of a mile away. It was walking parralell to the woodline then took a 90 degree turn into the woods. When I saw this I immediately slowed down to about 50mph and looked intently into the woodline by this time I was able to get my sisters attention (she was listening to music on the I-Pod looking down) we both stared into the woods and Icouldn't see anything but see thinks she saw something black moving in the woods. I still can't believe what I saw, there was no cars parked on the left or right shoulders of the highway. The creature did not appear to be running the entire sighting lasted for 7-8 seconds.

"I am 45 years old, have spent my whole life in the woods. I have been hunting and fishing since I was very young. On June 28th my wife and I decieded to take a walk in the woods. We were heading to a secluded resivior located aprox. 2 miles in the woods. We came upon a spot in the woods that seemed liked someone was watching us. We heard a noise come from some bushes. I thought it was a grunt from a buck. We both expected to a deer come outof the brush. I said, maybe it was a Bigfoot. She told me to shut up and keep walking. We walked for another 15 minutes and realized we were on the wrong path to the lake. We stopped, ate lunch and headed back into the woods. We had stopped at some power lines and sat in some shade. It was over 94 gegrees that day, and this was about noon time. As we walked back, we both noticed some very DEEP foot prints that did not look right. They were clearly 5 toed ""Human"" prints. In between the prints, was some deer tracks. The tracks clearly looked like the Human prints were chasing the deer prints. We both looked at each other and said, why would someone be running Barefoot, in 100 degree weather in the middle of the woods on a Tuesady afternoon? There were no other people in the woods at that time. The tracks were not there the first time we passed this spot, the noise was, the tracks were not. At this point I became very concerned that what ever made the prints was still in the area. I grabbed a big rock and told my wife to take some pictures with her cell phone. The tracks were about 6 to 7 feet apart. I could tell the first print was a right foot, that jumped out of the woods. The sixth and final step was a left foot that looked like it pushed off into the woods. No other tracks were before or after these six prints. We both became very nervous and started talking loudly and whistling. I did not want to run into this ""person"". We became a little confused and ended up on the worng path home. We walked for a couple hours, no way were we going back the way we came. Did not notice any smells or sounds. Just very quiet.

"It was a mild day and I decided to take a walk in the woods. After traveling about 5 or 10 minutes down a woods road I heard 3 deliberate and distinct knocks which emanated about 50 yards away from inside the brush off to my left, it stopped me dead in my tracks. I have read many of the incidents on BFRO and I could not believe what I was hearing. I composed my self and found what I considered a sturdy stick and struck a large pine tree close by in the same manner as I had just heard. It took about 5 seconds and a reply came back but only 2 deliberate knocks this time. A couple of seconds later  another sound came from a direction parallel  to the first but about 50 yards apart. This sound was like a tree being struck but with the stick breaking on impact. When the stick broke it sounded like it had a girth of a couple of inches. I struck my tree 3 more times but nothing more happened. Let me add that as I was strolling down this trail I was smoking a cigar and the wind was blowing into the direction that the knocks came from.  I continued down the trail which takes you to the edge of a pond. While exploring there I found an interesting thing. Lying on the ground was what looked like a 3 foot wooden club with a jagged end where the roots would be, it looked like something that you would see in a cave man picture. There were also 2 holes in the ground one next to a tree, the hole about 12 inches in diameter and close to 20 inches deep the other about 5 feet away from the tree 3 or 4 inches in diameter and only 4 or 5 inches deep with the club laying on its side and the small end partially in that hole. I believe that this club dug both holes because of the way the end was all rounded and imbedded with dirt. But I do not understand why. I decided to go back the next day for photographs and I brought a yard stick with me to get these measurements. When returning  the next day I discovered a good size pile of feces on the trail about 15 feet away from the tree I had knocked on. Nothing unusual took place this day but I did take a few pictures of various other things as well which may or may not be relevant. What or who  made those knocks I will probably never know but be clear on this they were distinct, clear, timed and deliberate, of this I am sure.",The closest intersection would be Walnut Street and Marion Road.

"There were two separate incidents within 12hr time of sounds so unusual that, to this day, I can't explain or rationalize out of my mind.  I had arrived at a campsite near Thompson Pass, the evening before the start of deer hunting season. The campsite was about 500yds off the forest service road and in a dense pine forest, near a logging trail that led to a creek. I settled in for the night in a sleeping bag in the cab of my truck, waking up at about 0400, with the need to go to the bathroom. I rolled the window down and listened for any ""critters"", most notably bears. Grabbing a flashlight, I left the truck and relieved myself. As I was preparing to return to the truck, I began hearing the sounds of something breathing deeply to my left and to the rear. Shining my flashlight in that direction, I saw nothing, heard nothing move. I quickly got back in the truck, and then began hearing this warbling, like a man yodeling in a high pitch, from the direction of Thompson Mountain. I rolled up the window and stayed awake with my .44mag. I waited until dawn to leave the truck to hunt- I usually leave about a half hour before dawn, depending on how far I'll be walking to the area I plan to hunt, but those noises had really spooked me. I got to the heavily wooded ridge partially up Thompsom Mt, at  the convergance of two main game trails, remaining there until about 3pm, only seeing one small doe moving quickly head hunched down. I passed on it. I then began moving down back in the general direction of my truck, and keeping an eye on the area where a spring comes out of the side of the mountain, and trickles down to Witherspoon creek. From the area where I had been hunting came this bone vibrating sound, so loud with like multiple harmonics , its hard to explain. It was beyond a roar. I half expected to see a dinosaur crash through the trees, it was such an unreal sound. It lasted 4-5 seconds. I was out of there and on the way home, scared spitless. I've since mentioned the experience to a few co-workers, and none have had or heard of anything like it.","Bridger Teton National Forest- HWY 30 out of Cokeville, WY, North to HWY 89 to Salt Creek pass, right turn onto Forest Service Rd 10072 east into National forest about 16mi from main highway to FS 10138 to 10128 north to Thompsom Pass Please don't post actual directions online.",Lincoln County,Wyoming,Fall,Report 6037: Hunter hears unusual vocalizations on two occassions,42.4829,-110.5979,9/14/2002,6037,Class B,9x93emc0f4,70.8,49.03,27.26,27.67,0.44,0,0.28,,,rain,1019.18,Clear throughout the day.,7,10,267,1.73
"Apr 20, 2003- A friend and I were carrying in supplies on foot to a bear bait site about 2 miles west of hwy 89. This area is restricted to foot or horseback only and is on the Idaho/Wyoming border. I had carried in the bait barrel and some bait items a week earlier, having noted some bear tracks in the snow along the creek the first week of April. We walked along the foottrail early morning and about a mile in came upon the fresh carcass of a muskrat right on the trail, which was about 30 feet up from the creek and along the bend of the mountain. We were both startled by the dead muskrat because it was just there with no evidence of a predator in sight. I suggested that it may have been dropped by an eagle, but honestly there had been no sightings of eagles on our walk. Another mile in and we began placing our bait in the barrel, having noted that the bait already there had not been disturbed by anything. We were preparing to leave the site when we heard the cracking of branches and looking in the direction of the noise,we watched a large piece of a tree tumbling down the mountainside towards us. About 400yds up on a ledge stood something bipedal, the color of a moose, leaning against the remains of a tree. I asked my friend ""What is that?"" He replied ""must be a moose"". And I answered ""but it only has 2 feet!"" He did not reply, but started walking back to the trail. I looked back at the animal which was 7-8ft tall as best as I could estimate, very broad at the shoulders with legs that appeared long and thin compared to the rest of its body. It was hard to make out the shape of its head, as I couldn't see a neck and its head appeared to be bent, looking down the mountain towards us. It then quickly moved behind the broken tree and into the treeline . I wished I'd had my binoculars that day, but in our haste to get on the trail that morning, I accidently left them in the truck. My feeling while returning along the trail to the truck was almost of myself being stalked, a strange ""role reversal"". My friend moved quickly down the trail, no words spoken about what was on that hillside. When I recounted the experience a couple months later to friends, I had forgotten the part about the dead muskrat, which my friend quickly interjected to them as a very disturbing incident to him. Yet he laughed when I told them we may have seen a Bigfoot, which he readily dismissed. This bear bait site, coincidently, is along a drainage that connects to a larger creek near where a year ago, I had heard some strange and disturbing sounds on a moutain pass while hunting deer.

"I was delivering newspapers on a lightly snowing early morning in Novemeber of 2005. Id guess it was 4:30 or so, just before dawn. The roads were barely dampened. It was a very pretty almost wintry scene. The high Uintas range was behind me. I turned from highway 411 to highway 410, which takes one back into the town of Mountain View. There are no lightposts until you cross the bridge and drive maybe 1/4 or 1/8th mile. As I turned from hwy 411, I looked towards the first light, about a fourth mile away. It could have been 1/2 mile. There was something pretty big walking. It was walking toward me, and it looked like it was all one bulky thing- no coat or hat lines that I could see. It seemed to have its head pointed slightly downward. Not a lot, just a tad. It also seemed like its arms were slightly long. It didnt seem to be bothered by the cold or the light snow. It was just walking like it had somewhere it was going. It walked diagonally across the road, towards a clump of brushy trees. It seemed like it strode big, but not in a big hurry, but not a casual stroll, but it  crossed faster than a man. It walked on two legs but not exactly like a man...Ive seen moose, deer, elk, steers, skunks, foxes, one little bear, porcupines, you name it, but it wasnt any of these. I got to where I had seen it go into the brush area, and there was nothing. There wasn't a roadway where it had crossed, being in between two ranch houses, located farther in than where this thing was. Being an isolated area at that time in the morning, I slowed to see if I could see anything like if it had been a person for some crazy reason out for a walk there at that time of morning, and it was a bit cold. I figured if it was a person, Id see it walking on one of the ranch house roads, but no, nothing was there. I felt pretty uneasy, so I continued to drive home. The area there is pretty, with a river running East and West just before where I saw that larger than a man thing. It may have been between 7 to 9 feet tall, but I'm estimating with the size of the lightpost, the trees it disappeared in, things like that. I couldn't see if it was black or brown, but it didn't seem dark enough to be black. Years ago in the early eighties we had lived in Lyman, six miles past Mountain View. We had a dog, as a lot of our neighbors did. One night while my husband was on graveyard shift, the dogs raised a ruckus. It was a pretty moonlit night I think in summer. Or almost fall. But I looked out my bedroom window and saw walking behind our house in the alley something really big, swinging its arms and seemed silently just striding past. I got so scared I pulled my covers over my head and didnt move for a long long time. My dog and others were howling. After a while things quieted down.   Way back I had a friend who had been driving up in the Uintas on the Utah side who claimed a bigfoot thing walked in front of their truck, stopped and looked at them, them continued on. This was I think in the late sixties to 70.  The Uintas are beautiful, and are probably  8 to twenty miles within distance of where I saw that thing in Nov of 2005. I didnt hear anything when I stopped to look. If it was hiding in the bushes, it wasnt moving, because I didnt hear any limb cracking. But I did have a strong sense that something was staring at me. I normally see a deer or two in that area, but I dont think I saw any that morning, I dont recall for sure. For awhile I would go through that area (still having to deliver papers) feeling like something watched me at times.  I'm pretty spooked by this whole thing.","Well, if you are coming west from a small town called Milburne, you would turn left(towards north) from highway 411 onto highway 410.

"I was alone, driving after dark from Belington, WV on US 250 North (two lane highway) toward Philippi, WV. About a mile out of town, I had just passed a small group of houses on the right. The highway curves to the right; there is a long guard rail on the right side of the road. As I was coming around the long curve, my headlights caught something up ahead, standing on the white line on the right side of the road. At first I thought it was a very tall, lanky human, at least 6’4”, with long reddish hair and a long beard, but as I got closer, I realized there were no clothes, just reddish brown hair over its entire body. The hair length and texture reminded me of a horse’s groomed mane, the hair was smoothed and not matted, and my impression was that it was a very tall monkey type animal. I did not see eyes, I got the impression it had closed its eyes when it was startled by my headlights. It stood frozen as if surprised by my headlights, very stiff, with extra long arms down by its sides. As my car went by it, it did not move, but was so close to my car I thought my right side mirror would hit it, but it did not. The incident lasted only about 10 seconds. My first thought was that it was a “skinny Bigfoot”, but that those things don’t exist and if they do exist, they are not in WV, they are in the Pacific Northwest. I kept going, as it really scared me, and there was no way I was going back to see what it was. I shook all the way home, I think because it resembled a human somehow, and because it was unlike anything I have ever seen, except in a zoo. When I got home, my daughter and her husband were visiting, we also had family from PA there. I told my family about it privately, they were skeptical, of course, and laughed about it. My husband does believe I saw something, but doesn’t have any ideas about what it could have been. I decided to look this up on the Internet and I saw there were incident reports and even expeditions for WV --- and that there is an incident reported for Barbour County! I almost had a heart attack when I saw this report was in the same area as my incident. I considered reporting it to you then, but was first discouraged from it by family. I believe what I saw was some sort of animal, and I reasoned that it obviously isn’t hurting anything or anybody, and I wouldn’t want it hunted down. I told no one else for several months, and have tried to just forget about it.","Near Belington, driving toward Philippi on US Highway 250, about a mile North of intersection of Rt. 92 and US 250.

"I was traveling in my vehicle coming across a bridge with a well known river passing underneath, when I noticed a large tree that had fallen into the water off to the right about 200 yards. As I looked at it, I peered up over the concrete railing and saw something standing in the river perhaps 75 yards away. My first thought was 'well, there's a bear'. But as I kept looking, it was apparent to me that it did not have a snout of any sort. It's face was like a human face, but black. This creature seemed to be in the middle of something (fishing?) and I had either spooked it or interrupted it. As I looked at it, it was looking at me and following my vehicle with it's gaze. It was black and it had long hair, like a shaggy dog. Trying to remember now, but I don't believe it had a neck of any sort that I could see.I corrected myself, before veering over too far and rubbing against the railing. I kept driving. It never occurred to me until later that what I saw was a Bigfoot. Am very familiar with Bigfoot and thought if I ever saw one it would be walking away or from a distance, and be a unique experience to remember for a lifetime, but it was nothing like this. And to be honest with you, it was an intimidating experience and I have not been back to that area since.","This is an area that I am very familiar with, have fished there many times, seen deer, bobcat and coyotes but nothing strange or never heard any strange sounds.Before I was born there were rumors of panthers in the area. Lots of wilderness in this area. Years ago, teenagers used to swim in the river.And people would throw out their trash, old mattresses or furniture there.

"The witness' daughter originally submitted this report after he had relayed it to her. Subsequently, Vince Lauria and myself met with the witness on March 19, 2003 and conducted a personal interview and had the witness take us to the actual sighting location. The following is the account of the sighting as told to us by the witness. On February 18, 2003 at approx. 5:30 AM, the witness was heading eastbound on Interstate 10 when he saw what he first believed to be a person stepping out onto the highway just as a tractor-trailer rig had passed it. Because the tractor-trailer rig's rear lights illuminated the animal he was able to see it.  The witness tapped his brakes to disengage the cruise control and turned on his high beams. He stated to us that his first thought was perhaps someone had broken down on the Interstate or been involved in an accident but when he got a better look at it, he realized it wasn't human. He stated that, ""its hands hung almost to its knees and it moved in a hunched posture."" When questioned further, the witness stated that it moved with its knees bent in ""almost a glide"" and that its arms stayed by its side as opposed to swinging back and forth. He further described the creature as being approximately 7' in height; 250 to 275 pounds with a muscular, ""squatty"" build and was covered with reddish hair. The head appeared to sit directly on the shoulders and was somewhat pointed. A note of interest; the witness told us the hair on it's head looked ""slicked back"" as if it had just been combed, not as if it were wet. He also stated that the creature never looked toward his truck so he didn't notice any facial detail. According to the witness, the creature wasn't running but was moving ""at a good trot"". It crossed both traffic lanes and the breakdown lane in 4 or 5 steps. At the time of the sighting, the creature was approximately sixty to seventy yards from the witness, and the sighting lasted about thirty seconds, maximum.","Interstate 10, east of Caryville",Washington County,Florida,Winter,Report 5884: Road crossing sighting by motorist,30.7599,-85.76891,2/18/2003,5884,Class A,dj7nbr8vrs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We had begun fishing along a slough a few weeks ago.and we had been catching some good fish along it so we descided to clear out our own spot for camping sessions along its bank. The strange things started happening about maybe a week ago now...We were night fishing along the bank when my friend Jacob spied something across the lake looking at us. I pulled the jeep up and shinned the headlights across the lake and he caught a glint of amber like eyes staring at us. He and Jonathon our other friend said the thing was massive. Saying it could have went eight to nine feet tall easily. It was haunched over in a set of dead grass that stood pretty high. It also had brown wavy furr but other than that I never got a look at it as it apparently fled before I could lay eyes on it. Now just last Friday we all descided to go camping and ignored the previous encounter from that night...We set up late in the evening with the cloudy skys rolling in. It rained on us a little bit but we ignored the bad weather and even grilled some burgers over our open pit fire. Me and Jonathon eventually left Jacob alone while we went out and cut some more wood. After we left my dog who is actually a small dog became real anxious according to Jacob. It would bark and howl towards the woods surronding us...then whimper and whine to my friend...Jacob said he felt like he was being watched but didnt wish to ruin our camping trip. He also smelled an oder because the wind just happened to shift for a moment..He says the oder was like a very smell gym rat after a hard work out...but perhaps magnified by ten. We returned shortly after and eventually I took Jacob home because of his uneasyness. Jonathon and I stayed till about 1 Am when the encounter actually happened. We never saw anything though...Jonathon had been sawing down a small tree for more firewood when a loud whooping/moaning sound echoed just thirty feet behind us. The sound was unrecognizeable as any animal we had ever heard and we have both spent many hours in the woods hunting. He and I debated the sound on the other side of the fire nearest to the water when it came again this time much louder and deeper...sounded even closer. I told him it was time to leave as the hair on the back of our necks stood up. I pulled my dog out of the tent...The dog is usually very hyper and happy but on this night he cowered and refused to leave the santuary of the tent. Once out of the jeep he acted very quiet and sat in the backseat unmoving. I was so afraid by this point I clambered into the passanger seat instead of going around to the drivers side where the sound was heard...We took off and left all of our camping gear...The bad feelings we had seemed to disappear once we had left the area. We came back the next day with our camp in good order still but my tent which had been zipped up at the time was open..I looked for any sort of sign but could not see anything other than the burger patties were missing. Also an old hoe we used to shovel up leaves was half way burnt...It had broken on us that night but we moved it well away from the fire..It was found near the fire and partly burnt. We also found what looked like a foot print near the area of the sound but we could not really identify it...It was bigger than my foot though and I wear size 13s.,The location is down south of Belleville.

"September 24, 2008 reporting sound from Prescott, AZ. 09/24/09, 11:30 p.m. My wife and I were sitting in our bedroom with the bedroom window open, we were working on papers for our personal budget when we heard a howl that lasted for quite some time, this occurred several times within a 5 minute time frame. The sound was so out of the ordinary that both my wife and I stopped what we were doing and looked out the window and listened to the howl. Both my wife and I have heard many animals from enjoying the outdoors such as elk, coyotes, deer, and bear, but this howl we could not place. When the howls ocurred the dogs in the neighborhood all started barking. The howls seemed to be coming from quite a distance but they were still very noticable. We live in a quiet rural neighborhood where the elevation is approxiametly 6000' with lots of pine, oak, juniper, and lots of  brush. If I were to guess at where the sounds were coming from I would guess from a higher elevation, but not sure.

"Our family was driving home from vacation last August when I saw something unusual in a cornfield. We were roughly 40-45 minutes north of Bethany Beach, Delaware traveling on Route 1 passing through farm country at the time.  We had rented a minivan and my husband was seated upfront driving with his Father next to him in the passenger's seat. They were busy talking.  My daughter and mother-in-law were seated in the row of seats behind them.  My mother-in-law was reading a book to my daughter at the time.  I was seated in the very last row of seats in the minivan and sat on the passenger's side of the car. As we were driving along and everyone else was busy either talking or reading, I was looking out the window at the passing countryside.  We were going through farm country at the time and as we drove past one corn field, something caught my eye.  The thing that initially got my attention was the fact that the corn stalks were now dried and yellow and it appeared that something dark brown was standing there in the middle of the corn stalks.  The roadway was slightly elevated above this particular field so I was essentially looking down onto the tops of cornstalks rather than them being level with the van. Having an interest in the subject of Bigfoot, I immediately went into observation mode and noted the following:  What I saw was medium to dark brown in color, it was taller than the cornstalks, it appeared to be about 3 feet wide and I may have been looking at a head and shoulders and it definitely wasn't a piece of farm equipment, a scarecrow or a human.  In fact, I noted that there were no humans around on the farm at the time.  I was able to observe this for roughly 5-10 seconds as our minivan drove past this large field.  The brown ""thing"" was roughly 300 feet in off the road in the cornfield by itself. I quickly tried to note the general location of where we were at the time.  I do not live in Delaware and was not familiar with the precise location.

"The incident occurred at about 6:10am on the first morning of a Boy Scout Group 50 mile hike in the Payette National Forest.  We had a group of about 10 boys and 6 adults and had hiked into Loon Lake the previous evening.  Loon Lake is a fairly typical Idaho mountain lake surrounded by pine forest, and we had set up camp on the north east end of the lake. I was in my tent with my two sons, ages 12 and 13.  We were still in our sleeping bags and the sun was just coming up when we heard the first series of 3-4 calls coming in from a distance. It was difficult to place the exact location of the calls because they were filtering through the forest at distance of what I would guess was 1/2 to maybe 3/4 of a mile from our location.  I thought the sound came from a location west and slightly north of us, but my younger son thought it was west and slightly south, closer to the crash site of the B-23, which is on the south side of the lake. The calls were unlike anything I have ever heard common forest animals make.  I'm not a big outdoorsman, but I've heard the sounds of most common forest animals and I believe I'm fairly sensitive to the nuances of typical vocalizations.  The calls came in two groups of 3-4 vocalizations each and seemed to float or diffuse through the forest due probably to the density of the trees and the distance of the emanation.  The first group was what I would imitate as  3-4 fairly low ""wwhhhoooooooo"" sounds of maybe 3 seconds each, very lonely sounding, haunting even, but very, very powerful.  The sounds seemed like they came from a very big animal with powerful lungs, judging from the way it emanated through the forrest. Bigger and more powerful than a wolf.  The calls were consistent with each other and the pitch did not vary much, tapering up and then down very slightly at the beginning and end of each call. Also, it seemed like the animal was really cranking on the calls because they would at times start to break slightly into what I would call a raspy scream territory, but only slightly and only in the middle of some of the calls.  My sons and I were talking excitedly about the first group of calls when the second group started, basically identical to the first. Other members of the group, both scouts and adults heard the calls as well.  As to be expected, the adults attributed the sounds to wolves and claimed to have seen wolf prints in the area, not willing to concede that it didn't sound like wolves, and might have been something else.  Upon our return home, I downloaded calls from the internet of elk, wolves and sasquatch (from your website) and had my boys listen to each one and pick the closest to the sounds we heard.  Without identifying the sounds to them, they both agreed the ""Ohio Howl"" from your website was virtually identical to what we heard, although I personally think the Ohio howl is a little higher in pitch.  I didn't find a moose call to download, but unless a moose can make this type of call, I have no other explanation for the sounds other than sasquatch.","The location was Loon Lake, which is a 9 or 10 mile hike south from Ruby Meadows in the Payette National Forest.

My friend James and I were fishing in one of his dad's ponds. We were frustrated that nothing was biting and had finally moved to the last of about 7 ponds.

"I was in the Arkansas Ozarks this fall just touring around checking out different streams to fish. I had gone into the Richland Creek area and parked in the primitive campground. I was alone and didn't see anyone else here at that time. Anyway I found a trail and took it heading downstream from the campground. I had read that there were bears in the area so I really payed attention to my surroundings. It had rained the night before leaving the trail wet and it seemed that no one had been on the trail that day due to the lack of footprints. I left the trail two or three times to climb down into the creek to fish. It was very rocky terrain. I had gone about a mile down from the camground on the trail.

I saw four round prints in a small group that were not very detailed in the soft gravel. Then I saw a very large, 18 inches or more, print looking very much like a foot right on the edge of the water a few feet away from the other prints. This ""footprint"" was about 4 inches deep and full of water. It lacked any detail in the gravel except that it had very definite, entire edges and was shaped like a human foot. Well, I reached for my camera to shoot it, then I laughed to myself thinking people would think I was crazy. I mean at the time I did think it was funny and I discounted it on the spot. I did look around for more prints but the rest of the creek bed in the immediate area was solid rock. I had a long drive ahead that day and blew it off. It wasn't until I got back home to Dallas that I really had to stop and wonder about what I had seen. I felt like an idiot for not photographing it! I haven't been able to come up with a logical explaination for it such as an animal digging or a tipped over rock. Nothing. I told a few friends about it. I guess some people considered me sane still. My older brother seems to think I've been in the outdoors enough to know what I'm looking at. Who knows?",,Searcy County,Arkansas,Fall,Report 5342: Fisherman finds footprint near Witts Springs.,35.8019,-92.943,10/30/2002,5342,Class B,9ymgtj8cpj,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We had things happen that we did not realize were possibly Bigfoot related. 1. There was a owl that would hoot every night. Louder than any owl I have ever heard in my life. We used to joke that it must be as big as a man.  It was also slightly off sounding. Also, it called like this all year long. Not seasonally. 2. Our kids became afraid to sleep in their rooms. They said someone was watching them. They never saw anything, but said they just felt weird. So they slept in our room with us. One night around 2 a.m. we were all woken up by a pounding on our house. Pounding so hard on the other side of the house that our bedroom windows were rattling. My husband yelled and it didn't let up at all. Just a rythmic pounding. Our gun case was in the room closest to the banging. My husband jerked that door open, grabbed his gun and ran outside with a flashlight. There was nothing there. He ran around the house and still didn't see anything. The next day we walked around the house looking for prints of some sort and there were no visible prints. The grass was very thick and lush at the time. Our nearest neighbors were over a mile away. This was about June 2002. 3. We had a momma goat that gave birth to twins. We found her and one baby dead by a pond about a mile from the house. Not much left of either except the hides. We thought it was coyotes or maybe a mountain lion, but even then it seemed unlikely. More like they were carried there. No drag marks anywhere. 4. Our new neighbors and their children came over for dinner. My husband and our neighbor went to check Gates and cattle in a pickup. The kids were playing outside in the yard and the wife and I were talking in the living room with the door open so we could hear the kids. About 45 min before sunset her 13 year old son came up to the house and told us he was scared. His mom asked why and he said he heard something weird in the woods. He was starting to tear up while he was telling us but his mom said oh stop that, go play. And he did. I yelled at the kids and told them to come closer to the house and stood with the door open listening. I thought I heard something off in the distance, but I thought maybe it was a bull and sounded odd because we lived down in a narrow valley. I stayed in the doorway watching the kids and chatting and heard the sound again and told the kids to come on in, because it was kind of creeping me out. I was feeling on alert but still wasn't exactly worried. My husband is a prankster and I thought he was trying to scare me.  By now it's right at sunset and the woods about 100 yards from the house are too dark to see into. I heard the call again and I have never before or again heard a sound like that. By now the kids are freaked out, crying and telling me to come inside, my heart is pounding and I'm thinking- that's not my husband.... The sound started low and slowly went high, I have no idea how long it went on but the thing that made that sound had to have MASSIVE lungs. It wasn't a monotone sound. Almost like there were two sets of vocal cords sounding at the same time. A couple of very low sounds, almost like I could feel them in my chest more than I could hear them, and then it yelled again.  It sounded like the call came from the other side of the creek about 150 yards from the house, directly in front. I was more stunned than scared at this point, but my eyes were watering and I did feel strangely sad suddenly, and I had backed all the way up to the door. Right then the guys came back, from the opposite direction of the calls. We told them what we heard and they listened but heard nothing, grabbed some flashlights and ran down to the creek and followed the creek about a quarter mile but didn't see anything. I didnt hear it again after that but our kids never played outside close to dark after that either. After that we had some stuff moved around or missing. A couple of dogs disappeared and one night it sounded like rythmic tapping on the water pipes in the house in the middle of the night. My husband even crawled under the house to find out what was going on but saw nothing. The next day we saw the pin was pulled on the latch for the well house (by the creek) and the door was standing open. Just odd things like that. We didn't spend time outside at dusk or night after the August incident.","The Google maps directions are accurate.

"I'm probably going to regret telling this story. Everyone I know will probably laugh me out of the country. I myself for many years would hooraw and laugh every time someone would mention these creatures. Here it goes. I live in Northeast Texas not far from Texarkana. I haved lived in the Texarkana area for quite some time. I don't coonhunt anymore my business has become more demanding. Coonhunting is a sport that really demands a lot of time. I found I didn't have the time to devote to it so I got rid of my Walker hounds. I was so into the sport at one time I had hunting Licenses in 3 states. I had several Night Champions to my credit. Several years ago on a cold night in Jan/Feb I believe it was in 2000 - don't remember the exact date. I was coonhunting in Miller County, Arkansas. I don't know exactly how far from Mercer Bayou we were but I know we were in an area the ole timers call Thornton Wells. While we were hunting in this flooded timber, our dogs split treed. I went to my dogs who had treed on the other side of the swamp.The other guys went to their dogs on the other side. I got to the tree my dogs were treeing at and looked at my coon and caught my dogs. Everthing seemed ok so I decided to amble back toward the others. I could just barely hear their dogs treeing way across the bayou. Suddenly I heard something walking in the flooded timber. (Bare in mind this whole area is 8-15 inches flooded with brackish swamp water.) I could tell by the gate that it was someone coming in the flooded woods. So I called out to them thinking it must of been one of my hunting companions. To my dismay no one answered - instead all I heard was a deep throated gurgling growl and the awfullest putrid smell. The smell was like when you kill a wild hog and grab him by the hind leg and then you give out dragging him and put your hand up to your nose and the smell knocks you over. I also heard a whining kind of a whistling sound. My dogs were on my leash and were whimpering. Now these weren't just any dogs. These were UKC Lipper bred Walkers, they probably weighed in at close to a 100lbs.They would could rip a 20lb coon apart. Yet there they were cowardly crouched behind my legs whimpering. I knew I had seen them tear coyotes to shreads that had tried to come into a tree where they were treeing. I couldn't understand it. Still in all I was not concerned about any of this and got my dogs and started back across the swamp. After a few mintues I heard this sound of someone or something walking in the water again. So I stopped and turned around and standing right behind me was a creature of immense size. He must have been at least 8 or 9 ft tall. He was covered from head to toe with a real dark hair and when my coonbuster coon light hit in the eyes his eyes glowed like a deer in a spotlight. Talking about the hair on the back of your neck standing up, I was scared. I don't ever remember being that scared. He made a hissing sound and reached down and took his hand and started scooping water and throwing it up at me and making a deep throaty noise. My dogs started chomping at the leash and growling trying to get at it, having regained their bravery. I grabbed the leash and tore out across that swamp so scared that for awhile I went in the wrong direction. I got to a big Cypress knee and caught my breath. I could hear the thing behind me sounded like it was about a 100 yards or so back. It followed me for a ways then after a while I could hear it across the bayou making a moaning sound and moving away slowly. I got my breath and my compass and my bearings and started back to the truck. When I got there I didn't say a word to my friends about what I saw and heard for fear they would laugh me down. Needless to say I never returned to Thorton Wells nor do I plan to. For a long time I kept this to myself I even had nightmares about it. The only person I ever told was an old coonhunter from Doddridge, Ark. He's dead and gone now but I do remember something he said to me that day. He said, if you're smart you'll keep that to yourself I know from experience that people will laugh at you and call you a liar. I've hunted in the Sulphur River bottoms many nights but never have I seen anything like that before or since. I'm not one for tall tales but I thought I would share this terrifying ordeal with you all because it seems we might have something in common.","Close to Miller County Wildlife Management Area, not far from Mercer Bayou in an area called Thorton Wells not far from Fouke, Ark between 71 and Old Blackmon Ferry Rd.",Miller County,Arkansas,Winter,Report 7971: Coon hunter and dogs experience close encounter in Sulphur River bottoms between Doddridge and Fouke.,33.18639,-93.9475,2/19/2004,7971,Class A,9vvhy1ms8x,71.91,65.2,58.49,44.08,0.66,0.15,0.98,0,0,,1013.87,Mostly cloudy in the morning.,5,9.35,183,10.09

"It was late summer at my grandfather's cattle farm. My grandfather owns XX's of acres of property in Pope County, in the city of Russelville. He lives on a small corner of his property on about XX acres of land on which he grazes his cattle. One night when were sitting on the porch of his trailer home, we noticed that something was disturbing the cattle. The ""Brem"" Cattle that were usually calm and scattered by the barn on the far side of the property, came running to the fence as they usually did when threatened by a Coy dog. Without giving it a second thought we hopped in the truck, grabbed the night vision binoculars and the high beam and started around the perimeter of the grazing land. We saw nothing until we came down near the pond where the cattle were watered. At first, we missed it with the night vision goggles because it was so still. But when we ran the light through the trees, we caught the glare from its eyes looking right at us. It was too far up in the trees to be a deer or a coy dog and the eyes were too big to be an oppossum or coon. We trained the light on its eyes and as we scanned down the tree, we saw what looked like a very large man leaning very still against the tree. He was huge, around 8 feet tall with black hair and eyes. His hair covered every inch of his body except for his face which was slightly less hairy around the eyes and forhead. I saw him first because I was using the high beam to scan the tree line and brush for eyes. I was too afraid to say anything and by the time I finally found the words to say and pointed grandpa in the right direction, the creature had turned and walked away.

"In October 2010 I was bow hunting on Camp Robinson military compound in North Little Rock, AR on Approximately 23,000 acres. I was hunting between two mountain ridges in the bottom of the valley approximately 100 yards from a thick creek bottom. I started the afternoon hunt at 2:30 pm finding my way to a new stand set up. I hunted all afternoon seeing alot of good deer sign in the area. After what started to be a promising day in the deer woods. I did not see a deer all day and the sun starting going down behind the mountain ridge to my west. It was getting so dark out that I could no longer see thru my peep sight. So, I decided to start packing up my backpack and start my decent down the tree. By now, it was well after dark and without my headlamp I could not see 3 foot in front of me. As I started to make my way down the tree. I heard the most disturbing sound in the woods that I have ever heard in my life. It was a very, very, loud, deep toned, gravely, blood curdling Growl/yell which seemed to be approximately 150/200 yards away from me to my southeast. It sounded as if someone was trying to yell for help. I immediately froze to the side of the tree and tried to gather my thoughts on what it could be. I originally thought that it was a person in the woods trying to play a prank on me. Mainly, because I had seen a pickup truck drive down the distant ridge several hours earlier. Then I realized that it was too loud to be a human screaming in the woods. I remained frozen to the side of the tree for several more minutes and tried to gather my thoughts of what could have made that sound. I am 43 years old and have been an avid hunter every year in some capacity since I was 6 years old and I have never heard anything like this in my life. After several minutes I finally made my way to the base of the tree, packed my stand, grabbed my bow and started to walk out on the trail that I walked in on into the direction of the ""sound"". I had about a 50 yard SE walk towards the ""sound"" then 100 yards west to an old logging road then 300 yards north back to where my truck was parked beside a small pond. So, as i left the tree walking SE and arrived at the west trail. I got a very uneasy feeling like something was watching me. So, I stopped to listen. Its was then I heard the ""sound"" again. It appeared to be moving closer to my location and approximately 50 yards away. Needless to say, I did not stick around to see what it was, for all I had was a headlight, bow in hand and a gut knife on my hip. So, I immediately start sprinting toward my truck. I have NEVER been so scared in my entire life. I started my truck and got the hell out of there. On my drive out of Camp Robinson. I called several of my closest friends and my dad and told them of the encounter. I stayed up all night on the internet to research this sound that I heard in the woods that night. I listened to mountain lions, african lions, tigers, bears, bobcats, foxes, coyotes, wild boars, etc... and I could not find anything that would come close to what I heard. The very next day. I drove back to the same area at Camp Robinson where I heard the ""sound"". Again right at dark from the comfort of my pickup truck with a pistol in my hand. I heard the sound again further down the valley approximately 1/4 to 1/2 mile away. I was a very distinct sound, very loud.... Since, these three occurrences. I have hunted at Camp Robinson on many more occasions and I have not heard this ""sound"" again. Still baffles me to this day of what I heard those two nights and I have still never heard anything like it.",East of West Boundry Road between Clifton Mountain Rd and Demolition Road on Camp Robinson Military base.,Pulaski County,Arkansas,Fall,Report 39922: Bowhunter intimidated by loud vocalizations at dark on Camp Robinson National Guard training base,34.92684,-92.30753,10/30/2010,39922,Class B,9ynqeqpxwd,71.77,56.58,41.39,33.94,0.57,0.04,0.76,0,0,,1019.6,Clear throughout the day.,5,9.86,200,1.37
"I saw an unidentified animal around 7:55 P.M. on 12/7/12 on the side of the road with gray fur I was driving at night on I-40 W from Little Rock to Conway around the 144 marker. It was on the right hand side of the road and was in a slumped/ sitting position. The animal was very large and had long gray/silver/black hair but mostly a dirty light gray. The best view of the animal I got was the broad side of its back.  The widest part of the body was at the elbows and it appeared to be about 4.5ft wide. From what appeared to be the head to the ground was about 5.5 ft tall. As I passed by I tried slowing down and was able to see  a profile shot of the animal. It appeared to be sitting looking at something on the ground. I would guess that it could be a deer that was hit by a car. I see deer at night on the sides of the road here almost every night coming through this area. The size of the animal was scaled to a road sign I saw just before the sighting. It was a large 4x4 sign that was turned backwards so all I could only see is the gray back. Minuets later after I saw the sign, the same distance from the road and slightly down the embankment was the anima (about 1.5-2 ft away from the white line).  The hair was similar to that of those long haired cows all over the body but still was able to see muscles under the hair very similar to a gorilla. After it happened I was not sure what I saw. I tried to classify the animal. To this day I have no ideas for sure what I saw. I have seen hundreds of animals at night driving and this was the first thing I could not ID. The animal had an eerie resemblance to a Bigfoot. At the time I had never heard of a Bigfoot with light colored hair and until I saw an episode of Finding Bigfoot where an eye whitness saw a white colored Bigfoot. I am open to any possibilities of the ID of this animal. Please let me know the BFRO's thoughts.

"We started hunting this 80 acres around 2003. I was  sitting in my Deer stand when some dogs came barking through the woods like they were chasing something.  They went up into this corner where the woods and the fenceline meet and started rolling around in the dirt and barking so I got down to run the dogs off and to see what they was rolling on and when I got to the corner I could smell something that smelled like dead animal, musky and sour.  Then as I turned something across the powerline in the woods approximately 50 yards away let out this deep long growl.   I have never heard anything like this in my life so I started backing away and when I got to the path I ran to our truck. After we got home my husband and I looked up growl sounds and I never could find anything that sounded like this it was horrifying to me! I also had another incident with my husband back in  about 2003 we was going out there to this property and feeding the deer. We was on our four wheeler and we drove to the powerline and the man who owned the property had been there and bush hogged  and had moved some tin that was laying there and the grass  was dead where  the tin had been lying. Right in the middle was a cell phone so my husband picked it up and It have been chewed on by dogs are coyotes or something so he laid it up on the tin  which was about 4 feet away.  So we filled our deer feeders and left. We come back the next day job to the powerline and the cell phone was back in the dead grass area exactly where we had first found it.  So my husband picked it up put it back on the tin.  So we check the feeders and left. We come back the next day drove back to the powerline and the cell phone was gone and they're in the dead grass area laid a piece of pipe  about 2 foot long so we picked up the pipe and put it on the tin  and we left. We didn't get to come back the next day but the following day we came back drove to the powerline and the pole was gone but there in the dead grass laid a little white button. It  was the kind of button you see on mobile home ceilings.  By this time we was freaking out. So we put the button on the tin  and I laid in the dead grass area a ponytail holder I had and also I mint.  Nothing took the ponytail holder or mint.

On Monday June 7th at around 3:00 I went horseback riding at a friends house. Shortly after I got out of the driveway and onto the dirt road the horse spooked and jumped sideways. I heard 2 HEAVY footsteps in the woods quite close to the road. You could hear small trees and branches beeing trampled. I saw a large white hairy figure moving quickly through the brush. It was hard to make out the complete figure. It was tall and big as far as I could see. Then as suddenly as it had happend the sounds were gone and I could no longer see anything.

"I was visiting some friends in Huntington Arkansas in the summer of 1988. We all decided to go to a local lake for some bass fishing. They had warned me that there were tons of water moccasins and to be VERY careful where I stepped. I was moving along the bank fishing and I was paying a whole bunch of attention to where I was placing my feet when all of a sudden there was a commotion in the woods about fifteen feet to the right of me. When I turned and looked I could see a very large creature, about 7 to 8 feet tall with very broad shoulders, and could hear a sort of ""whoooop whoooop"" noise. Thinking it was one of my companions trying to scare me I moved toward it. At that time it grabbed the tree trunk next to it and just twisted it off, and kind of slapped the ground with it, and made a very low guttural growl. At that point I was more scared than I have ever been in my life. It was really intimidating because its muscles were flexed, and its head was tilted down and it was staring right at me. My Dad had taught me about encounters with bears and what to do. My instinct was to run, but my Dad always taught me that an animal will chase you if you run. I just dropped my pole and looked down at the ground and slowly backed away. The animal followed me a short way and just turned and walked into the woods. When I got back to where my friends were I told them happened and they just laughed at, and made fun of me. I have never been back to that part of the country and now live in the desert where there are few trees.",,Sebastian County,Arkansas,Summer,"Report 8527: Man has extraordinary, close encounter while fishing near Huntington",35.09306,-94.356,4/23/2004,8527,Class A,9yhzsukpcu,76.76,69.965,63.17,66.4,0.87,0.71,0.13,0.0013,1,rain,1012.62,Heavy rain overnight.,6,8.51,89,4.27
"I live in rural part of Sevier County, Arkansas.  On 2/6/11 I went out to feed my dogs. They are tied out about 150 yards from my house. As I was feeding the dogs I noticed a large barefoot track measuring about 13.25 inches long and 5.5 inches at the widest part  and 4 inches at the instep.  I saw only one right footprint as the snow was melting quickly. I found another track west of the house about 300 yards from the first one. It was more melted so the toes were not as clear.

"In early November 2002, I decided to get in an afternoon of squirrel hunting before deer season opened and the woods got full of hunters.  I drove to an oil well location that is located south of town off the main highway and parked my truck there. I left the location and walked down an old road and headed east into the woods to hunt along the ridge and wooded area that joins the swamp.  I'd walk the road and then leave it and wade through the bushes looking for squirrels then head back to the road and follow it for a ways and then leave the road again.  I'd been hunting for a good while and had gotten to an area where the briars and bushes had taken over the old road.  I decided to turn around and hunt back toward the truck since it was getting late, and I hadn't seen but one squirrel and that was soon after I got into the woods. Just as I started to head back, I got a whiff of the most foul odor that I have ever smelled.  It actually made me gag, because I have a very weak stomach.  I figured it was a dead animal or a wild hog, but I'd never smelled any hog that stunk that bad. I knew I couldn't stay there with that smell, so I turned to head back down the road.  As I did, I heard something make a couple of growling type sounds in a clump of bushes off to my left, and saw the bushes just shaking like hell.  I still figured it was a hog, but I'd never heard one that sounded like that and figured if it was a hog it would grunt instead of growl.  I was getting nervous about meeting up with a big boar, or maybe even a big cat, so I took off at a fast pace back up the road.  After I'd gone a ways, I heard what sounded like three squealing hoot type sounds, still to the left of the road.  I was very spooked by then thinking that can't be a hog, and picked up my pace even more.  After a ways, I stopped to listen and when I did, I heard something out to my left take a couple of steps and stop. It sounded like someone walking out in the bushes, and it didn't sound like it was too far away from the road and I could swear I heard heavy breathing.  I headed for the truck again wanting to break into the clearing before it got completely dark.  Just as I got within sight of the well location, I heard the walking sound again and looked behind me thinking I'd see a person following me on the road.  What I saw was a tall reddish looking creature cross the road behind me about 20 yards.  It was moving in a hurry and I only saw it for a second or two.  It stepped completely across the road in one step, then it sounded like it was running away from the road through the bushes.  I took off for the truck at a full run and when I reached the truck, I jumped in and got out of there in a hurry.  I don't know what it was that I saw, but I'm sure that it was at least a foot taller than my 5'8"" and it looked massive, like a giant hairy man with long arms and long hair all over it's body, and the fastest moving thing I've ever seen or heard. I've been back to the area since then with my nephew, but the timber has been cut in that area and it's no good for hunting anymore.  I didn't smell, see or hear anything when we went back to  those woods.","South of El Dorado, AR on Hwy 167 there is an oil well location about 300 yards off the highway to the east.

"My friend and I were on a vacant road (Victory Dumas)directly off of Calion Road in El Dorado, AR.  We were sitting on the tailgate of my truck just hanging out.  I got up to go get my cell phone from the passenger's seat and was about to open the door when I glanced up.  I saw a creature, about 15 yards away, standing upright about 4 to 5 feet tall on the left side of the road.  With great speed, it ran across the narrow road, and paused when it got to the other side without looking at me.  It took off into the woods.  When it did so, my friend jumped off of my tailgate, not seeing (only hearing it) and asked ""What was that?""  I said ""I have no idea"" and then I told her to get in the truck.  When we got in, I told her that I saw ""something that didn't appear to be human but was running upright.""  It appeared to be dark brown or black in color and looked to be covered in hair.  It was hunched over, yet very quick.  I can honestly say I have never seen anything like that.  We sat in the truck for 5 minutes out of fear.  I gassed it and left the road quickly.

"I am writing this because i think that i might have had a recent  experience with a bigfoot. I live in Springdale, Ar. Springdale is not very rugged as far as forest goes, but it can get pretty secluded in the right places. On october 10,2002 me and a friend set out on a trip to follow a creek to see how far it goes, because i followed this creek when i was young. This creek goes through springdale, and winds in through Elm springs,wheres theres nothing but dense trees on one side the left, and open fields, to the right-private properity. Well Elm springs is not a big city, and you would never know the surrundings where i was not unless you owend the properity.It was about 5:00 pm when i decided that it was time to try to get out of the creek and up on the bank,we had been walking about 2 hours in and out of the creek,and i decided that we could cover more ground on land before the sun went down. Now im about 5""9 and i guess the creek bed must have been 7 foot high,so i had my friend C hoist my foot up while i got my knee up high enough to pull myself up.Now the original plan was to yank him up once on top,but looking back on it now i realize how foolish this was because i would had to be extremely strong,because i probably could have just have barely have had touched his fingertips from way up there,but it didnt matter because what i saw when i got on my feet scared the crap out of me. The best way to explain it is just to tell you that my heart sunk,and I was just extremely stunned. When i got to my feet i was facing nothing but dense forests or woods,somthing caught the corner of my eye about lets say 75 to 100 yards off. Just before getting a good enough look at it i could tell it was big and brown,now ive never seen a bear before out in the wild, so imediately i started to panic. I took one quick look down and figured i would break every bone in my legs if i were to jump,for the water was only maybe a foot deep, with all this happening in what i would say just about 2 seconds,and keep in mind i havent even been able to warn my friend yet of what i thought to be a charging bear, i look back to see this thing or whatever it was walking extremely fast! It was then i noticed that this couldnt have been a bear. I got a clear look at it for just a second.Ill never forget what i saw that day.I remember its head, real long head,i guess you could say it was shaped like an egg, i just know it wasnt like a humans, the eyes must have been dark because i couldnt make them out,i didnt reall notice a nose ether, but there was so much hair, it was hard to make anything out except for the head.The biggest thing ill never forget is the height and weight of this thing.It was so big,legs coverd with hair, so massive,that had to have been the biggest part of this thing,so wide,had to have been as wide as a refrigerator.In comparing the legs to my legs i would have to say each leg made two sets of both of my legs.The shouldars were massive,could have been three feet or over from shoulder to shoulder.I also remember how it walked, besides taking extremely wide steps, it kind of walked with its front body slightly hunched over,i dont know, like some one with bad posture.The height of this thing was astronomical.The tip of its head was in the tree tops!!! now dont get me wrong, the trees werent that tall, but they were at least 8 to 9 feet where the limbs started to curl out and i remember the head was up there with them, there is no way i could have jumped and touched the limbs, they were just to high up.So i would put whatever it was that i seen to be 8 to 9 foot tall. And looking back on it now, the frame could have easily held 500- 600 pounds,the arms on it looked long, and they swayed back in forth heavily,i do not recall a odor,or anything like that,for this thing was out of my view in about id say 5 to 7 seconds. Now i realize when i was getting up the creek bed, i had spooked the thing,because it sure didnt waste no time getting gone into the woods.And i was not about to follow it.So with all this said,i asked my friend if he had heard anything,which he said no because of the running water,and i guess because he was down there,and i said man,i just seen a monster go into the woods! ofcourse my facial feachure was very solemn and serious,but he still didnt believe me.I repeated this several times to him,and i guess he could tell by looking at my face i was serious.He later said my face looked white. With his help i got down back into the creek,but it did take a few minutes,and even then i wound up falling back down in the creek,luckly i wasnt hurt,just wet and scared,the sun was setting,and we jogged and trampled our way back,never once daring to go back up on land. We talked and thought better of muterring such foolishness around for fear of people thinking were nuts. Truthfuly,i dont even think he beleives me.But putting myself in his shoes i probably wouldnt either.But it doesnt matter, i know what i saw, so in closing i have ruled out the possbility of a hoax,1. why would somebody be out in the middle of nowhere in this kind of costume? 2. how would they know we were coming?3.how do you account for the height and size, it was easily a foot taller than any human ive ever seen.It was so tall,you cant duplicate that kind of height.Ihope someone reads this and takes it seriously because i dont know if ill ever go into the woods again.","Im not familiar with location,me and my friend followed Spring creek from Springdale into Elm Springs,where there is only dense woods,id say about five miles into Elm Springs,out of the creek bed,to the left,about fifty yards off.",Washington County,Arkansas,Fall,Report 5316: Daytime sighting by hiker near Spring Creek.,36.20611,-94.23417,10/10/2002,5316,Class A,9ykvzxhgbs,66.2,63.63,61.06,55.66,0.86,1,0.16,,,rain,1016.99,Overcast throughout the day.,4,8.74,68,3.92

"I'm still wondering if I should be telling this since it's still hard for me to believe what happened while hiking an old logging road in Cedarville, Arkansas located in Crawford County. My parent's had just bought a home. We had been in the home for about a year now at this point and I had now a very good knowledge of all the forest area around us. And as a 15 year old boy I loved going out into the wood's finding deer antler's and going on hikes up to the old forestry observance tower. This particular Friday I had planned to take my pup tent and a little food with me and go camping like I had done several time's before. I started my hike with my best friend, Chris H. who was staying over for the weekend to go camping with me. We left the house right after he arrived, around 5pm and we got to where we were going to camp out at around 7pm high up on the mountain which is a long, hard and treacherous hike by any means. We set up out tent and made a nice fire and started to cook hot dogs when I needed to go to the bathroom so I went off into the wood's to do natures business. Shortly after digging a hole I heard something being thrown through the branches. This happened about 4 or 5 time's and I thought it was Chris clowning around and I yelled at him to stop throwing stuff at me, I then heard him yell back that he didn't throw anything to quit playing games that if I throw something again he was going to throw something at me. It didn't make sence, I wasn't throwing anything at him, I was pulling my pants back up when I was hit with a stick about an inch in diameter and about a foot long that was freshly ""twisted"" off of a tree. I got back and had the stick that hit me in my hand because I was going to hit Chris with it since he hit me but he was in his tent and I asked him to come out and he said he wasnt that he was mad at me for throwing stuff at him that he got into the tent so he wouldnt get hit. About that time we heard low, long grunting burping sounds that started out quiet and got louder towards the end of each grunt, I didn't know what it was but it was getting louder each time, it would make the noise 3 or 4 times and stop and then the sound of something being beaten on with what reminded me of hitting a baseball bat aginst a tree but really hard and then hard thud sounds like it was being hit on the ground and then the grunting would start again. By this time me and Chris were scared, I had a 22 rifle with me that my dad made me always take camping if it were just us kid's in case of coyotes. I got the 22 out of the tent and Chris got the light and shined it into the wood's and about 25 yard's from us we saw a very tall man standing there beside a tree as soon as the light hit his area, he ducked behind the tree but we noticed with the light he was huge, around 7 foot tall at least and was wearing what reminded me of a gillie suite that hunters wear, all covered with a redish brown fur. And the smell that was coming from it was awful. It reminds me of road kill and a wet dog combined together. I didnt even dare using the rifle because I knew that if you shot anything large with a .22 you're just going to do much to it because even a deer wont drop with a .22 and this person or thing was a lot bigger than a deer or a bear which are in the area. Me and Chris backed up slowly,poured water on the fire, we were  still hearing the grunts but not the same sounding grunt's, these were now more of a growling ooohhhh sound. We finally turned and using the light to keep from breaking out necks ran as fast as we could. I havent been hiking or camping since, don't ever plan to go again and will not live near any forest areas much less in. We moved from Cedarville 2 years later and I haven't been back since and won't be for as long as I live. Me and Chris dont even talk about that night. We both had nightmares for a long time about that night. I know what I heard, smelled and seen and never want to see it again. Now I live in Las Vegas, Nevada and I'm fine without the forest and trees.

"My encounter happened in June of 2006 outside of West Memphis, AR between 4:00 and 5:00 pm. My then seven-year-old son and I were driving in my truck one afternoon to go feed our horses which we kept at my cousins home who live about twenty-five miles outside of town. We had decided to take a shortcut and get off of the paved county road and turn onto a small gravel road that ran beside a railroad track for about ten miles. There is a large frozen food warehouse on the corner of the county road and the gravel road but nothing else around. After we had passed the warehouse is when the creature leaped across the road in front of my truck. It happened very quickly. It cleared the road entirely in one leap and never touched the gravel road. It came from my right to my left and I nearly hit the creature with my truck before I could stop. I came within approximately two feet of it with the front of my vehicle. As I said before it was in mid-air when we first saw it. The creature appeared to be around four feet in height may be slightly taller and was covered in reddish-brown hair all over that was about four to six inches in length. It was like hair not fur because it was thin and flowing in the wind unlike what fur would do. The creature was lean and somewhat muscular and it's arms seemed to be disproportionately long for its size. If I had to compare it to something I would have to say it looked similar to an orangutan but I'm sure there were no orangutans on the loose that day in eastern Arkansas. I'm not sure what it was but I am certain of what it was not. It was not a dog, coyote, deer, bear or anything that I've seen before except for some sort of ape. My son said, ""Dad did you see that?"" I said, ""Yeah I did son."" He said, ""What was that a monkey?"" I laughingly said, in order to comfort him, ""I don't know. It was either that or a baby bigfoot."" When the creature landed across the road there was some very tall grass for several feet and beyond that the train tracks and beyond that thousands of acres of farmland with several patches of woods everywhere. When it hit the ground it took one step into the grass and then the creature just seemed to disappear. I stopped my vehicle and waited for a few minutes in hopes of seeing it again but we never did. And just like that, it was gone. It disappeared as quickly as it had appeared. For years now I have often thought about the incident and just exactly what it was that we saw that afternoon. I believe that it was a young sasquatch and it had been dumpster diving behind that frozen food warehouse, though I can't be certain. I've often wondered if there was an adult one nearby that we never saw. Because of that, I'm really glad now that I didn't get out and pursue it which had crossed my mind to do at the time. Well, that's my story and you can choose to believe me or not it makes no difference to me but I know what I saw and I can tell you that it's real, there really is some unknown bipedal creature or ape or whatever out there and we were just lucky enough to see one.

"Several friends and myself had gone together to purchase 120 acres of cut-over forest land that was totally surrounded by several thousand acres of timber company land.  This land was at the end of a small valley, and at the far end of a dead-end road. On my portion of the land was a small rise in the northern half of the valley, and I was building a shack to be used for hunting and camping.  One night,about 8:00, while working inside by lantern light, I decided to step outside on the deck for a cigarette.  As soon as I lit my lighter, a roaring, crackling scream commenced from the slope of the ridge to the south; about 300 yards away, but in direct line of sight.  I was too startled to do anything but stay rooted to the spot and feel the hair stand up on the back of my neck; something which hasn't happened to me in years.  While the scream lasted for only a couple of seconds, it seemed to go on much longer. Since it was very cloudy and dark I ran inside for a flashlight, all the while wishing I had brought my rifle inside from the truck.  With a flashlight and a hatchet I headed for the truck only to find that the truck itself seemed to be moving.  In the bed of the truck I found my German Shepherd ( I had forgotten all about him.) curled in a tight ball in the corner and shaking so hard he was moving the whole truck. We left immediately. Several nights later, one of the friends who had laughed at me when I told the story came out to see how I was progressing with the shack.  He laughed more at the extra lanterns I had placed inside and outside, and at the pistol and shotgun I had laying on the table.  We stepped out onto the lit deck and almost immediately the same grating scream came from exactly the same spot on the south ridge.  In a flash my friend was standing back to back with me as we stared out into the dark. Since the dog was not with us, and because we were armed and had good flashlights, we stayed there for two more hours, but heard nothing else.  But I was certainly glad to have a witness this time. Several weeks later my friend and I ran into one of the other property owners and were relating the story to him when I noticed him becoming a bit pale.  He finally told us that he had been burning piles of deadfall on his part of the property - that butts into the south ridge - and was walking back and fourth to the stream to get water to put out the several fires when he heard something walking around him in the woods.  It was too dark to see, but he at first assumed it was a deer or maybe a bear.  After he had listened for awhile he decided it sounded like a two-legged creature and believed it was one of us trying to play a joke on him.  So he continued putting out his fires while listening to whatever it was make a circle around him.  But when it got upwind from him he began to smell a terrible odor that he admitted scared him so badly that he got in his truck and left, ignoring his still smoldering fires. I cannot say what it was that we heard, or what the other man smelled.

"Wednesday, October, 12, 2005 our neighbors dogs were very active and barking all night.  The next morning about 5:30am my own dog was barking in the backyard.  I opened the door to calm her down and I heard something in the back of our property near the fruit trees.  It was very heavy sounding and I could hear branches breaking as it departed.  The next morning around 8:30am my husband went to his truck in the backyard and heard something behind our shop take off running.  He thought it was a hunter and ran to the back to listen.  He thought it sounded like it was on two feet.  He said it stomped very heavily as it was running through the woods and he could hear snorting.  Sunday, October 16th, I went walking around the neighborhood road and discovered several sets of large and small barefootprints on the gray slate road in front of our house.  At first I thought it was a childs footprint until I looked closer.  There were two sets.  The largest measured 13.5 by 7 inches and the small print measured 9 by 4 inches. I took pictures of all the prints and measured each print.  They consistenly measured the same size.  The large print is about 3 inches wider than my husbands foot and he's a big man.",This area is in the Arlie Moore area of the corp land surrounding Lake DeGray.,Hot Spring County,Arkansas,Fall,Report 12824: Two sets of tracks found near Lake DeGray.,34.31611,-93.17056,10/16/2005,12824,Class B,9yjepz53bd,81.24,66.23,51.22,52.63,0.65,0,0.47,0,0,,1018.99,Clear throughout the day.,6,9.41,145,1.03
"On 12/4/05, at approximately 8:15 a.m. I was standing approximately 50 yards from the south-west corner boundary marker of my property when I heard the neighbors dogs start to bark and run southward on Arkansas Highway 7. They only ran a short distance before stopping. I immediately thought that they must be barking at a deer that was crossing the road.  My first thought was to get my gun from my truck.  Then, I remembered that I had parked outside the fence in front of my house.  So, I decided to just stand there and see if it was a doe or buck and hope it would not feel pressured since the dogs had stopped barking.  I also believed the deer would change directions if it saw me hurrying in its same general direction.  Therefore, I just stood still and waited in hopes of getting a glimpse of it.  Then, if the dogs would keep quiet, I could hunt it later.  Only one got to see it for 2 to 3 seconds, but I saw it clearly. My first impression was that I was observing a very large man who was wearing a hooded black parka, then I realized it was some kind of animal.  It was approximately 50 yards away and was on the opposite side of an old fence that has been overtaken by grass, weeds, vines etc. I only had a left side view as it was traveling east along an old fence row.  It covered a distance of about 20 yards in about 3 seconds.  I could only see its upper body.  I could see that it was not a bear but I couldn't make out distinct facial features from the side from that distance.  It was like an ape in some ways but its posture appeared more man-like. I can best describe the size by comparing it to a very large man I know who is approximately 6’9’’ and weighs roughly 280 pounds.  This creature was least that tall, possible a little taller, but close to the same build. I did not get a long view of it. I probably would not have had time to take a picture even if I would have had a camera in my hand. It was moving at a brisk pace, but not lightening fast.  Its stride resembled a trot or a jog.  The body was moving quickly but there was no up and down motion. It appeared to have a moderately thick coat of black hair. From what I could tell its face was dark too, as if there was some hair on its face. It was moving through a well used deer crossing. There is an old fence row there, on of both sides of Arkansas Highway 7.  The west fence row had recently been cleared and the east side was logged about five years ago and has a fair amount of undergrowth and a game trail running along the south side of the fence row. Just a little to the south west of the spot there is a thicket that is approximately 3 acres in size.  There are a couple partial open areas in the woods here. Most parts of this thicket can be walked through fairly easily. In places the thicket is too thick to move through without clippers and or a machete. I did not see where the creature crossed Arkansas Highway 7 but it most likely came from an area that is about 40 yards away from the highway’s west side ride-of-way. I believe that this creature waited until there were no cars coming becoming before crossing the road.  I did not get the impression that it was running from something. I have mentally replayed the entire scenario many times and I have stood and looked at the same area where the creature was seen. I looked for tracks after the incident but the ground was too brushy for obvious tracks. I've stood in the spot where I observed the creature from. I've watched as vehicles traveled north and along Arkansas Highway 7 and considered every other possible scenario. It wasn't any kind of illusion. It was there and I saw it.",The general location is approximately 3 miles south ouf Bismarck.,Hot Spring County,Arkansas,Winter,Report 13211: Early morning sighting by resident along Highway 7 near Bismarck.,34.285,-93.162,12/4/2005,13211,Class A,9yjg013s85,43.48,36.265,29.05,29.25,0.59,0.64,0.11,0,0,,1018.09,Mostly cloudy until evening.,2,9.77,27,3.83

"My children and I were driving back from my mothers home in Cushman, AR on Thanksgiving day around 10 PM. We were approaching Newark on hwy 65 south. Just outside of Newark, Macedonia Road turns off the hwy to the left. We had to stop for traffic as we came up on that road. There were 2 cars in front of us...the 1 in front was waiting to turn left onto Macedonia Rd. There were 3 cars in oncoming traffic and 1 car on Macedonia Rd waiting to turn left onto hwy 65 toward Newark. As our truck slowed due to the stopped traffic ahead of us, I saw something very dark in a crouched position behind the car directly in front of us. As the vehicles started to move the figure stood and stepped all in one motion off the side of the hwy. It was on 2 legs and taller that the cab of our full size pick up. In the crouched position it was taller than the hood of my truck. You could see the profile of a head, shoulders, back, buttocks, legs and arms swinging wide. I was speechless. My daughter, 11 at the time, also saw  the figure and said ""Did you see that??"" As she locked her door. I was a MAJOR skeptic until this. It really left me scratching my head.

"Myself and a friend were hunting this water hole where deer and elk come to drink. The location is approximately 7 miles north of the small community of Sawmill, Arizona on the Navajo Reservation. It was during the Archery Elk season on the Reservation of the very last day of the season which was Sunday. At about 6:00pm, we set up a small portable blind near the water hole and crawled inside. We waited quietly for about acouple of hours or so. We observed some cattle that came in to drink. There was also a coyote that came to drink. At 8:30pm, the sun went down behind the ponderosa trees. We decided to crawl out of the blind and break the blind down. As we were taking the portable blind down, we heard a high-pitched scream that came about 200 yards NW of the water hole. We stopped and listened thinking it was an bull elk. Again, the scream came 30 seconds after the first scream. Right then, I said ""that don't sound like a bull elk at all"". As I said that, another scream came which seemed to lasted a lot longer. At this point in time, we decided to leave the area. We didn't know if the scream was coming closer to our location.

"My name is Dr. XXXXXXXXXXX I'm a chiropractor. One afternoon a few weeks back, I was on my way from Show Low, AZ to a ranch past Concho, AZ to work with a horse.  I'm certified in animal skeletal adjusting (chiropractic for animals.) Between the Y in the highway and Concho, about 6 miles outside of Concho, at about 2:30 PM, on a clear, sunny day (Oct. 26, 2006), I saw something come up onto the road about a half mile in front of me.  At first, I thought it might be a very large dog as it initially was coming up onto the road, but as it fully entered the highway, I could see that it stood straight up, to a height about as tall as a road sign, maybe 6 or 7 feet?  It had long, dark brown hair from top to bottom and stood absoulutely straight up, no slouch, no forward bending at all. It ran across the road from my right toward my left and remained fully standing as it ran off into the brush.  The full incident took maybe 10 seconds. The area I live in is plentiful with big animals - elk, deer, bear, big cats.  Many of my patients come to see me for injuries after auto encounters with these big animals.  I've had some very close calls myself.  During the 12 1/2 years I've lived here I've seen several animals I had never seen in the wild before.  Each one, including a coaty mundi, were immediately recognizable.  My far vision is incredibley good. It is my habit to drive hypervigilant for animals here. I'm quite familiar with bear movements since they are pretty well a nuisance to locals and spotted often here.  It's the only other local animal that could have possibly fit the description as far as fur, color and standing height.  However, bear do not stand straight up to run across a road.  In fact, they don't stand straight up.  When they stand, they sort of hunch and hang their front paws.  This did no such thing. Immediately, I was very confused because I thought it looked like how a sasquach is described, but I didn't believe there might be any such thing as sasquach/bigfoot in Arizona of all places.  The Pacific Northwest, maybe, but Arizona?   It was beyond my conception. Since then, my wife and I have been looking for information on the web and have discovered that there have been sightings in this area for years by the White Mountain Apaches, who are generally pretty closed mouthed about it. In retrospect, I realize I should have stopped and searched for tangible evidence, but I had an appointment and didn't want to be late. I am fully convinced of what I saw and confident in my observation capacities.","Coming down off a slight rise.  The sides of the road were low, you would have to climb up onto the highway.

"Although I have had very good class B encounters, this Class A sighting was something that I will treasure. On Feb. 1, 2007 I took my husband to Show Low AZ to drop him off for 10 days with friends. The weather had been bad that day and progressively worsened so that I did not take my normal route back to N.M. which is through the White Mt. Apache Res. I went down U.S. Hiway 60, it runs between Show Low and Springerville AZ.  Past a small town called Vernon, the terrain loses almost all of the juniper trees and is mostly rolling grassy hills. I have learned a type of defensive driving in Elk country, wherein you keep alert to the peripheal vision movement. Something drew my attention to the left hand side of the road and I applied brake anticipating an animal (elk, deer, pronghorn etc.). What I saw made me turn and pay attention. It was bipedal and running dead at the road. I slowed as fast as possible and watched in open mouthed awe as the creature placed one hand on the t-post (metal pole used in barbed wire fencing) and vaulted over the fence, slowing very little and continued running. It crossed the road (2 lane black top) in maybe two full strides and kept going into a narrow canyon and beyond my sight. I pulled to the side of the road and called my husband. He could not believe what I was saying. He finally asked me to get out of the car and look for tracks or hair or solid evidence (once a cop always a cop). In very unladylike words I told him no.  I was alone, unarmed and unwilling to meet something that big on a road that I had seen fewer cars in two hours than I had fingers on my hands. The creature was dark brown and had longish hair. I never saw its face full on, it had to be close to seven feet tall or more. It never seemed to be afraid or running dead out.  More like a lope or steady jog. The weather was cold and heavily cloudy, mix of precip. off and on all day. No standing snow.

I told her that its something huge with a good set of lungs. We heard it about 5-6 times. Duration of the calls would last like 10 seconds long. About 5 minutes later, the call ceased. But we could still hear the dogs barking away. Then at 4:45am, we heard one more call from the same location.

"We always try to get as far out as possible and this past weekend we went in a little further then last. It was on Friday the 8th of October when we got to our location we set up camp in less than an hour and we were just enjoying the views looking forward to some relaxation... We got our fire started about 7:00 pm because it was getting really chilly about an hour later we were talking away just shooting the breeze when We heard something from a distance I turned to my boyfriend and I said shh, listen and sure enough clear as day the most sharp clear screams just came over the wilderness as if it was so clear. We counted them and finally they ended at 12 being the last scream count. The final two of the screams sounded most horrible from the other 10 you can immediately hear the difference it was as if in pain a painful scream. That was it for me to scare me half out mf my witts begging my boyfriend to please explain to me what the hell that was as if he could give me an answer, but all he could say is I have no idea. It seemed as if it were a distance away east of us the steep canyons I am sure carry sound further then it really is but I would estimate it at being 1 to 2miles away all I know is it was clear and carried through the woods. what in the wordl would have a pair of lungs like that? If I had to choose animal or human animal would be off and human no way not that scream in the niddle of no where. Now, I know that they're are plenty of animals in the wild and I know they all have their own distinct sound, but this was unlike any animal I have heard.. we went down the list of known animals that inhabit the Arizona wilderness and as we marked each one off it became more clear to us that was neither animal, bear, mountain lion, elk buggle sheesh even havelina,which are only in the more lower elevations and in more desert terrain. nope, there is no way. When we came back from our trip it was all we could talk about there and all the way home. Just to mention I didn't get much sleep after that,     that night we came home and I put in one of my videos on bigfoot just to hear the audio on one of the recordings and we both just looked at echother like wow! too similar to discard the possibility. since then I have heard all I could get my hands on of any audio I could find. Now looking at my maps of the United states and keeping track of sightings from all over it doesn't seem impossible that they could be here  with New mexico and Texas around the corner why not.

Guess we were about 30 miles from Flagstaff. Nearest Town Mormon Lake Nearest Road FR124 east off of Lake Mary Rd. Narrative Observed   My wife and I were camped along FR 124 Sun. afternoon through Tues. morning. Monday night, Memorial Day PM, at 7:30 I went for a walk heading east on FR 124 to maybe see some elk before dark. I went at least 1/4 mile and heard a coyote sound off. I stopped to listen and a whole chorus of coyotes joined in for about 4 seconds and stopped as quickly as they started. I would guess they were 1/4 to 1/2 mile southeast of me. A second or so after that I heard an ""AH,OO"" just as distant or even further away in the same direction. I thought someone was calling back to the coyotes but what an odd sound for a person to make, then there was another just the same as the first. I turned back to camp and wondered about these two calls as I walked  I didn’t stop to listen again as it was getting dark and I wanted to get back to camp. At 8:15 I was back and I sat outside our trailer to listen again. Just I sat down I heart the ""AH,OO"" again from the same direction  followed by a high pitch ""WOW"" sound then another and then one more ""AH,OO"". So there were four ""AH,OO"" and two ""WOW"" sounds all together, that I heard anyway. The ""AH,OO"" was a mid pitch for a male person, The AH was about 1 1/2 seconds with OO short and slightly lower pitch. The WOW was very high pitch and lasted about 3 seconds. Both of these calls just started and ended without fading in or out and without waver. I listen until 9 PM without any more calls then went in to sleep. The calls were not real loud, if I was walking on the gravel road rather than stopped I might have missed them, but they were bit enough to carry over the sound of the breeze in the trees which was coming from the west. I was hesitant to report this since it was just sounds, but , rather odd sounds for a person or any animal I know of.

"Myself and four friends we're sitting around a campfire listening to a very loud car stereo when 2 of the party simultaneously said shhh shhh what the hell is that, and 1 ran to the truck and turned the stereo off. Seconds later we all heard a loud aggressive, violent, bellowing and deep throated sound that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up and made others run for their guns and others their trucks. The hardest part of this event is the adjectives needed to descibe the sound we all heard. After listening to the sound recordings on your website, I and the group decided that the 1978 Snohomish County sound clip and the 1973 Puyallup Washington sound clips are close but not exactly what we heard. This sound was fierce, massive and came from a pair of lungs that nothing short of 600 lbs could produce. We all agreed the sound came through the local canyons roughly 1 to 2 hundred yards away.

"On this particular night I was awakened by a commotion outside my bedroom window.  It sounded like animals fighting.  There are many wild animal species in the forest where I live including racoons, skunks, foxes, and elk, but also domestic animals like dogs and cats.  I assumed the noise was coming from some of these animals.  After I sat up in my bed, the noise stopped.  I lay back down, and after several minutes I heard some very peculiar noises.  First, there was a series of ""whoops"" that sounded like a cross between a monkey's whoop and a whistle.  They seemed to be coming from different locations within about a 50 foot radius.  They were neither particularly loud, nor soft.  It sounded to me like 2 or 3 individuals.  Trying to come up with a rational candidate for the type of animal, I imagined it might be some sort of large migratory bird.  This is when I heard the second type of sound, something like a pig grunting but different.  It seemed as if there were articulation in the grunting.  It is difficult to describe, but it made my blood run cold.  The grunting seemed to come from only one animal, and was clearly audible.  This went on for perhaps a minute.  The area was then illuminated by a passing car and all sounds immediatley ceased.  Several minutes later I heard a loud ""crack"" from a large branch being broken in the woods at the edge of my yard.  I did not get out of bed or attempt to look outside as I was still quite frankly scared from the creepy nature of the grunting.  The next morning I looked around the immediate area of my yard, but found no indication of what may have made the sounds.",[Editor's note: Witness requested us not to publish the directions.],Coconino County,Arizona,Summer,Report 15125: Various late night vocalizations heard on a property near Flagstaff.,35.09,-111.7,7/3/2006,15125,Class B,9w0xd5yw16,81.98,69.035,56.09,46.23,0.48,0.25,0.25,0,0,,1018.43,"Partly cloudy starting in the afternoon, continuing until evening.",12,10,270,1.59
"ME my husband our two children and dog.  Were camping in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest In Arizona.  Right by Bear Canyon Lake at the end of Forest Road 9018. Saturday Morning I went for a walk with my morning coffee. I crossed a  fence looking for the lake. It was are first time camping at Bear Canyon lake and I knew the lake was close.  100 yards from the fence I saw a large mound of feces that was steaming.  It scared me, I knew what ever made that huge dropping was still very close because of the heat coming off of it.  I ran back to my camp site and thought it must have been a bear. I was thank full that the fence was between what ever it was and me.  Sunday morning about 4:00AM my entire family was awoken by a loud howling, screaming, growl. It yelled several times maybe 10 or 12 It was so scary I lost count I thought it would never end. The howling screams made the coyotes go crazy.  it was so close to are camp sight maybe 150 yards away in a sloping north east area of the forest.  We laid there as quite and still as possible waiting for day light.  Their were two more camping sights not to far from us but by the time we packed up and went to talk to the people at the other sights they had already left.

"On a cloudy, cool day I went for a hike at Hart Prairie on the San Francisco Peaks outside of Flagstaff, AZ.  It was August, but the monsoon season was in full effect and it was a cool day for Arizona.  I hiked up slope from FR 151 towards the Snowbowl Ski Resort.  The area has springs and so the plant diversity is high and the wildflowers were at their peak.  Being a cloudy, cool day I kept an eye out for wildlife which would normaly bed down at midday in August, though I did not see anything other than various songbirds and raptors. I had been in the area maybe two hours but as I like to wander around slowly (I see more that way) rather than ""hike"" from point A to point B at a quick pace, I had not covered much ground in that time.  I was at the edge of an aspen grove when I heard a loud howling from up slope and a little to the east of me in the direction of the ski resort.  My first thought was that it was a foreign tourist goofing off. Because Snowbowl has a paved road to it and the views are awesome, tourists from all over the world on their way to the Grand Canyon stop at Snowbowl and many hike around as it is a beautiful and inviting area.  So I thought I was hearing a human.  But I wasn't so sure after the next howl- I was really puzzled.  The sound seemed somewhat human-like and the volume, though  quite loud, wasn't too extraordinary- I could possibly howl that loud, though it would be hard to do without real strain and the sounds I heard were almost casual- no hint of any strain.  But it seemed to be an unusually weird sound for a human to make.  Almost as if the human had a deformation of some kind which distorted the sound.  This was why I thought of a ""foreign"" tourist first, because of the weirdness of the sound. I heard about a half dozen calls and it was clear that whatever was making the sounds was coming in my general direction at a rapid pace.  By this time, I was sure it was not a human but a large animal. I was at the edge of a clearing and I waited at that spot expecting to see whatever was making the calls.  The first howl was maybe 250 meters away and the final one maybe 75-100 meters away.  Then it stopped and I never did see anything.  I did not hear it moving through the woods and did not notice any smells.  It is possible that whatever it was smelled me as the air was gently moving up slope towards the animal.  I think it probable that this was the reason whatever it was stopped moving towards me and vocalizing. I waited a minute or so after the final vocalization and then I went up slope in the general direction I had last heard it but did not see anything or any indication of a human or animal.  My curiosity was at a peak and so I made a real effort to find whatever it was and spent another hour circling the area looking for signs of a large animal passing through. I have listened to the recordings on this site and I did not make a match between the sounds- though there were some similarities between what I heard and the calls from Washington State and the 'Ohio Howls'.  What I heard was not nearly as drawn out and evenly toned as the Ohio recording, but was similar.  A deep to mid-range 'howl' with a little variation in the tone somewhat similar to the Snohomish recording.  Each call lasted maybe 3-4 seconds and was seperated by various lengths of time from maybe 5 seconds to maybe 15 seconds.  Some of the recordings on this site, if I heard in the field, I might describe as having a 'monkey' quality to them- distinctly animal-like.  The Ohio recording does not really have that quality and neither did the sounds that I heard.  At the time I only thought of a human at first and then I was merely puzzled and could not classify what I had heard. I have thought about this incident since it occurred trying to put some explanation to it.  I do not think it was a human for a couple of reasons:  The sound, though it had a somewhat human-like quality, was not at all the type of sound a human would (or perhaps, could) make to communicate to another- say two or more people in the woods who are separated and walking along and vocally maintaining contact with one another. The volume of the sound would have required real effort for a human to achieve and I couldn't imagine a human being able to howl like that and walk around a mountain at that elevation at the same time- and it was traveling fast.  Nor did it have any element of humor about it if it was just some high spirited tourist having fun.  And there was only one caller, not two or more people hootin and hollering to each other.  The call was somewhat somber in tone and there was no hint of excitement or emotion about it.  Also, a human walking through those woods would have made a great deal of noise and I would have heard or seen a human when I went looking after the last vocalization.  I did not see any humans during that day though I went right to the base of the ski resort and could see the parking lot. At the time, the sounds did not spook me and I never got that unexplained adrenaline rush and surge of fear that I have gotten on more than one occasion in the wilderness or ocean.  I am quite familiar with the wildlife in this area and have heard and seen just about everything except a mountain lion. It certainly was not an elk, bobcat, coyote, dog, or cougar.  It might just possibly have been a bear-  I have had several close encounters with bears and have heard their vocalizations.  But bears do not, to my knowledge, vocalize in such a regular, loud way.  Because I heard 6 or 7 howls, I had time to really hear the sound and think about it.  To me it sounded most like an ape, though I only thought of this much later. What I heard was not much of an incident. I puzzled over it for a long time.  I am reporting it here because a sasquatch is the best possible answer that I can come up with, though I did not come to that conclusion until months after the incident.  So I did a web search on bigfoot and found this site and the recordings.  Another puzzling thing though- if it was a sasquatch, that area is quite popular with people and when I go there, I usually do see someone else.  That area could be easily avoided by an animal.  Despite the abundance of wildlife as a potential food source, why would a sasquatch travel through this area at midday in the summer , howling?  The whole incident is weird...","This happened just below the Arizona Snowbowl in Hart Prairie on the San Francisco Peaks.

"This happened on a camping trip on the weekend of 08/04 and 05/2007. I went with my friend, girlfriend and son to an archery shoot in Clint's Well Arizona. I live about one hour away. This area is centered from Strawberry Az. and Winslow Arizona. We were camping off of the Lake Mary Road by Clint's well in the forest area. On the early morning of 08/05/07 at about 3am I was woke in the tent by a loud knocking of wood on a tree west of camp. I lisened for about ten minutes and heard several whoop type sounds(approximately 3). These were consistent with the recordings on the website. I waited for about a half hour and did not here anymore noise and fell asleep. The next day I spoke with my native american friend who was in the tent next to mine during the archery shoot.

"My daughter was visiting from out of state although she grew up here in Flagstaff.  We decided one day to spend time with one of our hobbies which is photographing panoramic landscapes in Northern Arizona.  We spent the morning in Sedona photographing the red rock country but as usual this time of year the monsoon thuderstorms came up around noon and we went back to the house to relax a bit. We did have significant storms in the area that day but late in the afternoon things began to clear up and we decided to head to one of our favorite spots for sunset photography.  This was at the Arizona Snowbowl lower parking lot.  The area from the parking lot to the west starts with a large lush green meadow before falling away into forest, meadows, and rolling hills (cinder cones)that stretch from Hart Prarie some 80 miles to the Grand Canyon.  We set up our cameras anticipating a beautiful sunset and great opportunities to take pictures.  there were a number of people in the parking lot area (10-15). A minute later two hikers started from the parking lot down through the meadow and I remember hoping that they wouldn't be standing in that meadow when I wanted to take a photo. As they traversed the meadow and passed out of sight we heard a single coyote sound off in their general vicinity. As the sun sank towards the horizon and we were getting ready to start taking pictures the two hikers came back from out of the woods and up through the meadow nearly to the parking lot. At that moment we heard a scream from the forest several hundred yards below us.  There were people in the parking lot and two motorcycles idling right next to us.  The scream was so loud that not only did we hear it well but one guy on a motorcylce looked at his companion (with motorcycles running and helmets on) and said ""did you hear that-what the hell was that ?"" We know that most people in that parking lot heard this scream. As the sun was now setting in a glorious fashion with thunderstorms around and off into the distance we got busy taking pictures.  As the sun set and twilight began to overtake things most of the parking lot had emptied out except a pickup load of people had just showed up and they were half drunk and wandering around making noise.  It was getting close to dark and once again we heard this scream from the same general area of the forest below us.  The people from the truck said - "" what the heck was that - a mountain lion ?"" and began to laugh and talk nervously - I just wanted to say to them ""please shut up"" since if any other noises were made they would have been difficult to hear above their drunken mumbling and laughing. Finally they left - it was now dark, we hung around for a bit but not long and heard nothing more.  This was not a mountain lion scream or anything else we could even begin to identify.  It sounded somewhat like a scream a human could make but the distance it was travelling was significant.  It started kind of low and built up.  To us it sounded like the voices of 15 people all starting at the same split second and roaring the exact same note.  It had a quality that one human could just not make, both by the volume and the effect of sounding like a group but clearly being one single scream or roar.",,Coconino County,Arizona,Summer,Report 23440: Possible evening vocalizations heard near Snowbowl,35.33069,-111.7101,8/20/2007,23440,Class B,9w28czz0nj,73.98,60.65,47.32,50.68,0.67,0.08,0.25,0,0,,1016.47,Mostly cloudy in the afternoon.,10,10,257,3.81

"Well i live in bentonville Akansas right now, my dad own his own buisness. One Day we got on the subject i was telling him that i had bought a little book of ghost stories and bigfoot sightings and how i was very  itrested in bigfoot. Then he told me that he seen bigfoot before and he told me the whole story. At fist i didnt belive him, but a couple of years later he told me the same story when we got on the topic again. The story is that he was riding ATVs with his friends around or in ether lost bridge lake of bever lake and he was at the front of the group of 4-wheelers and they were going down this hill that led to a dirt road. Since he was in front of the group he went down first and got on the dirt road and stopped to wait for the rest of the group to come down. before they came down he lokked over across the dirt road on the other side of the hill on the tree line where the evevning sun was shining through the trees and seen the big foot walking. He said it was taking really big steps and apered to be 7-8 feet tall. He couldnt se the color because the sun was shining through the trees and big foot so you know it apeared as a shadow. Then the rest of the group came down and he told them what he saw and they didnt belive him. Thats all he told me. He told me he coudnt remeber every detale. But he still knows more than me, i cant remeber everything. The reason i'm telling you and not him is that i probably coudn't get him to get on here to tell you this. I'm telling you this because im learnig about bigfoot in our biology class at bentonville high school. my teacher is a marine biologist and a cytozoologist. We watched the big foot movie and the legend of boggy creek in class. Plus the sightings in Decator which is write by our town.

I usualy left for work around 5:30am.I would drive the old highway #68 towards Fayetteville-Springdale. One morning I was on my way to work and as I was coming close to where Fairmount road was I could see something by the bridge at first I thought it was a coyote or large dog scratching around the bridge with its back legs as I got closer I realized it was not and that it was a sasquatch, it was a reddish-brown color, I could see its face area had almost no hair and the skin tone was lighter than the rest of it. It looked up at me as I passed on over the bridge, my car was a vw bug and the lights were not very bright, it seemed to be startled. I lokked into the rearview mirror to see it jump up and run across the road. It moved in long strides and very quickly. It was tall maybe close to 7 feet and was thinner than I would have expected it to be.

"This is a late report, but however, it is a valid one. What prompted this report is the fact that I now currently reside in Snohomish County Washington and just read about local sightings in my area, surprised at the number of reports. I used to live in Orange County California, and an old girlfriend of mine and I, were camping up in Dutchman’s Flats area, near Idyllwild. We were out-packing, not in a campground. We were awakened by screams that resembled the sound of a pack of coyotes that had just made a kill right outside of our tent. The screams however had a bit of a deeper tone than a coyote. At the time that is what we thought it was, so we stayed quiet not wanting to interrupt a wild animals meal. The screams and screeches continued for what seemed like an hour, but was probably about 5 or 10 minutes. The screams stopped, but we could hear what sounded like heavy footsteps right outside the door to our tent. We could hear sniffing sounds, and heavy breathing sounds. That is when I got really scared. I know a coyote does not step like a 300+ pound man in combat boots. I was too scared to even turn on my flashlight, and take a look. (Thinking maybe a bear had just run off what we thought were coyotes). We stayed up, paralyzed all night with fear until the sun came up. Even then there was still a dead silence. No birds, no crickets, nothing.  I was still scared to go outside, but did. I could see that something was in our camp, due to the scattering of pine needles and dirt around our tent. But there was no sign of a coyote kill, like no blood or fur laying around. What I did see was a pair of big deep footprints going away from our site down into a deeply wooded ravine. The thing, what ever it was, walked upright, and had a 3 to 4 foot gait.  I followed the steps for a few yards down into the ravine while my girlfriend watched. It was still deathly quiet and I had a very eerie feeling that I was being watched. The footprints led right into a thicket and I could see it was a wide path left by whatever it was. I turned and ran back up the hill, packed our stuff up in a big hurry and left. At that time I was in my early 20's. I am in my late 30's now and take my wife and kids camping all the time up here in Washington, but I do it with a new respect for nature now.","I,m sorry , it has been 12 years.

"I was camping with my 7 year old son on top of Mt. San Jacinto, specifically Round Valley. This was the third year we had done this and the plan was to spent the night at 9200 feet and do the peak the next day. Spend another night in Round Valley and go back down the mountain the third day. The place we set camp was on the south east side of Round Valley with some large granite boulders to give us some shelter if the wind picked up. Surrounding our camp were ponderosa and jeffrey pines and not too far away was a small stream. This was early June and there were still some snow drifts in the shaded places. My son and I had eaten dinner and were getting ready for bed. At about 10:00 p.m. we were in our sleeping bags, but still talking and planning the trip to the peak in the morning. Suddenly without warning we heard a loud, low pitched whooping call in the boulders just above us. The hair on the back of my neck stood up and my son asked me if that was a monkey and I, not wanting to deal with a panicked 7 year old, told him it was just an owl. We did not smell anything or hear footsteps. Everything calmed down and we finally fell asleep. About an hour later I heard a load boom that sounded close to the tent. I looked out the window in the tent and saw a few clouds in the moonlight so I pulled our boots into the tent in case we got a thunderstorm in the night. The next morning we got up and had breakfast, then headed for the peak. We made the peak but by the time we got back to camp my knees were swollen and sore so I put some snow in a sandwich bag for a cold pack that evening to reduce the swelling for the trip out the next morning. That night was uneventful and we slept well in the high altitude air. The next morning we got up and began to pack up for our trip off the mountain. I went up on top of the boulders to make sure none of our trash had blown away from camp and make sure everything was picked up. I then saw what had made that load boom the night before last. 30 yards from our tent on top of those boulders was an 8 inch diameter ponderosa pine snapped off at the base. The tree was still green and fresh and had no rot in it and there was no wind to speak of either night. The only explanation I can come up with is that the animal that made that whooping sound had pushed the tree over. The tree was not aimed in the direction of our tent but rather parallel the direction our tent was pitched. I don't think the animal was trying to do any harm but may have just been expressing it's dominance over us.",S.E. area of Round Valley in the Mt.

"My girlfriend and I where on vacation in Idyllwild for the week and wanted to hike up to Lily Rock to the fire lookout cabin, but we couldn't get to the main trail head due to my girlfriends fear of driving without chains up a black ice covered road, so we stuck around Hemet Lake for hiking and trout fishing due to the factor that the main roads were more recently snow plowed and grinded red lava rock laid for more traction. Plus, I had lived in Mountain Center a few miles north of Hemet Lake, so I was pretty familiar with the area and its wild life inhabitants. I've been Hiking, fishing, hunting, rock hounding, and Prospecting in just about all of California for the last 20 years, from the Cascades to Azusa Canyon. On one of the nights, I think it was the 16th of November; we wanted to go on a night walk around Hemet Lake since the whole city of Idyllwild goes to bed at 8pm and it was about 10:30 at night, so we drove the 8 mile drive from our hotel to the lake. We arrived at the lake at about 11pm and sat on the car next to some big green trash bins about 150 feet or so from the lake; when we heard something 400 feet or so breaking branches in a canyon to our backs. It sounded big and didn't seem to care if it was heard coming down the slope, so I assumed it was just a big black bear until the smell. The only way I could describe it was a dying wet dog. A feeling of discomfort came over us both as we saw nor heard any more of what we assumed to be a big black bear coming down the canyon, meaning whatever came down the canyon was hiding in the tree line 300 feet or so away from where we sat. I got a chill up my spine and had that feeling that we shouldn't be here right now. We got in the car and left to come back just under a hour later hoping what ever it was would be gone, so we could try to finally go on our late night lake walk. We pulled up and backed into to the same spot as before to notice that one of the green trash bins had been pushed over towards the lake, and that there was a 2 foot wide 4 inch deep circular dent like something big had punched it. There was no paint smear like a car had hit it. It was and had been dead quite other than the unknown thing that came down the canyon about an hour before. I had no idea what could have done that to a big steel trash bin and for years until Google Earth Mapping of Bigfoot. I saw that there had been sightings, calls, and smells reported in the surrounding area, and came to the conclusion that might make more sense being a believer in crypto zoology.

I went back to bed, but I could not forget that sound. A friend called the next day and I was telling them about it.

I put on my shoes, stepped out of my tent, and kept hearing them, finally realizing that they sounded like the “knocking sounds” described by people who have reported bigfoot encounters. After about 5 seconds they stopped, and (I don’t know if this was just my imagination or not) I started to hear echoes of “voices”.  I say voices because it sounded like someone talking but at the same time it was gibberish with grunts. The next day my sister in law, who was camping with us, started to give us a hard time about all the noise we were making getting out of the tent and going to the rest room.  So I asked her if she heard the “knocking sounds” she said she did. She described them as someone dropping a heavy rock on a ply wood.  I asked my wife if she heard them but she said she was still half asleep and trying not to wet herself.  I’ve seen the show “Finding Bigfoot” and know what sounds sasquatches reportedly make, but I never thought I would actually hear them.",We were in the Burnt Rancherias Campground in the Cleveland National Forest.,San Diego County,California,Summer,"Report 36070: Possible knocks and chatter at Burnt Rancherias Campground, Laguna Mountain",32.81075,-116.4208,7/22/2012,36070,Class B,9mv4wv0bqx,79.02,68.325,57.63,55.68,0.66,,0.12,0,0,,1010.63,Clear throughout the day.,0,,272,1.21
"I was hunting with a friend for wild boar in the Los Padres National Forest near Lake Cachuma, Ca.  The lake runs on sort of an angle from west/northwest to east/southeast.  Just above the lake when travelling north on hwy 154 is an access road leading into the forest to a point near the northwest end of the lake (probably about 2 1/2 miles from the lake).  Near that point and about 3/4 to one mile away from the ranger station located there, my friend and I hunted along the west side of the road.  We were both armed with high powered rifles (I had a 300 H&H Magnum with 200 grain roundnose bullets).  This is rough country!  We were sitting on a hillside looking down the hill when we noticed what seemed to be movement. After about 1/2 hr or so, and not seeing any more movement, we decided to go and investigate what the movement had been below us on the hillside.  We crossed the trail which led into the area and went further down the hill toward the ranger station which was about 3/4 mile lower on the hillside around a bend.  Nothing was observed. About 5-10 minutes later, we climbed back up the hill and onto the trail only to find some footprints.  The footprints were about 18 inches long and (although we did not measure them) approximately 40 inches apart.  Whatever made the prints was heavy because the prints were deep in the soil, much deeper than any person could have made (especially in that short a timeframe).  The prints lead along the trail going w/nw. and were on top of our footprints where we had crossed the trail going down the hill less than 10 minutes before. We followed the prints for approximately 1 mile, but never saw anything except the continuing footprints.  We finally reached a vantage point  and could view the trail ahead for a mile or so.  It was empty, so we gave up and returned to the car. Whatever made those prints was able to get far enough ahead of us that we could not catch up and it had to be far enough ahead to be out of view when we reached the vantage point.  I do not think a person could have done this even if running. I never did see anything there but that was the last time I ever ventured into that area!",see above,Santa Barbara County,California,Fall,Report 13236: Boar hunters find fresh footprints north of Lake Cachuma.,34.60665,-120.0023,9/30/2005,13236,Class B,9q4sv7byre,86.61,71.785,56.96,41.74,0.34,0,0.91,0,0,,1009.02,Clear throughout the day.,7,9.68,175,0.51
"We have had various incidents over the past few years since 1998-2004 including 3 sightings, one amazing vocalization occasion, wood knocking, and one footprint.  First I must say that I don't think a bigfoot lives real close to where I live but I do think we live within it's (plural) normal range or migration route. The first sighting was in 1998 in the winter, we are not really sure...  My brother was driving home and was on our private driveway when he drove by something that he could not describe.  He walked in andsaid he had just saw a bear or a big black person wearing animal fur, or a cow...  Basically his mind could not fit what he saw into any specific category  and he was very confused.  Upon questioning him he said it looked like a homeless person wearing animal skins.  He said they passed right by eachother going in opposite directions.  Since our road is a graveled one lane road they must have been within a couple of feet from eachother! He told me it had just happened so we went to investigate.  I was thinking there was a homeless person passing through... But then we turned a corner and I saw the footprint from about 50ft away!  I was so amazed that I stopped my truck and got out and immediately took off my shoe and sock to compare sizes...  I was not thinking about a bigfoot, it didn't really cross my mind until a couple of years later actually...  I was still thinking it was a homeless person with huge barefeet!  I'm a size 12, I put my foot inside this track...  It was 4-6 inches longer and 3-4 inches wider than my foot.  And it was sunk into a hard pack dirt road about an inch or more.  Being 200lbs myself, I jumped around trying to make an impression an inch deep in this strata but to no avail.  I couldn't sink my own track at all! I mean no inches, nada!  So now I was thinking about a homeless person wearing animal skins with huge feet and that was significantly heavier than me...  But there were two problems to this obvious bigfoot sighting (in hindsight)... Number one, bigfoot do not live so far south in California (or so I thought), and my brother did not come in and say, ""I just saw a bigfoot!""  So it never occurred to either of us that this was a bigfoot sighting!!!  It wasn't until a couple of years later that I asked him if what he saw could have been a bigfoot and he said,"" oh yeah, that makes sense now...""  It took us awhile to put 2 and 2 together but we finally did with the help of this website.  I found it while web surfing and his sighting started to make sense...  Then I became more aware of my surroundings in relation to bigfoot.  We live in a typical second growth redwood forest with all the typical animals that I see quite often.  But I was never looking for bigfoot until now. 2004 was an exciting year.  We had 2 more sightings and a very loud vocal performance!  So, I was watching tv outside in the covered porch/ gazebo.  If you turn down the tv you can hear all of the night sounds as if you were outside.  Around 11:30ish pm  I heard something so I turned the tv off.  I then heard a very loud screaming roar right in front of my house.  And judging from the location of the first sound I heard that was distorted by the tv, I deduced that whatever this was was walking down my driveway and was very close!  It roared twice more while following the road.  I was dumbfounded!!!  And then I got scared... I've lived in the woods my whole life and think nothing of walking around in the dark with out a flashlight.  You couldn't have dragged me outside at this point!  I'm 6'3, 220lbs, and this thing sounded huge. I compare the roar to the decibel level of a siren!  It just echoed off the hills.  I have compared it to the recordings on this sight and it is very close to the Washington recordings, especially the one from 2005.  I am so glad that my dad and mom both heard this!  It just gave you the impression that it had huge lungs to make such a loud noise!  But interestingly enough the last roar was ended with two very clear dog barks that I presume were mimicked...  All of the dogs in the vicinty were going crazy except the dogs that were the closest to where this thing had traveled... Two nights later was the second sighting.  This time it was in the front yard of my Dads house.  I was leaving in my Suburban.  I was just edging down the driveway when I got something out of the corner of my eye.  I turned and looked at what appeared to be a large pile of redwood bark lying in the yard as if my dad had cut down one of his trees and had raked all the bark into a pile.  Redwood bark is reddish...  As I passed slowly by I realized that my dad had not cut down any of his trees and that there would be no reason for a large pile of redwood bark to be piled there.  What I have deduced is that a bigfoot was balled up hiding from me!  And it semi worked.  There was a fence between us and if I were in a smaller car I wouldn't have seen it, but I was very high up in a raised Suburban so I could see over the fence.  It looked as if it was on it's knees hunched over with its head on the ground and it's arms over it head.  I say semi worked because I kept driving and didn't realize what I had seen until a couple of minutes later.  When I went back my pile of redwood bark had disapeared.  I was so disapointed because I was only about 15 ft away! The next sighting I again missed out by seconds!  My wife and I were driving on our driveway and she said she had just I contact with someone...  I had driven about 30 more ft and stopped. I asked her and she said she saw a dark face with deep inset eyes and a shaggy head looking at her from behind a tree.  The windows of the car were still dewed up from the cold morning so I backed up and got out.  I heard bi pedal footsteps walking away through the oak leaves.  It was a very definitive sound...  I would have followed if I was not in business clothes... So I think a bigfoot or more lives in the area.  There are 60-70,000 acres near by and I believe we are in a corner of their range that they visit every once in awhile since the occurances are not everyday.",,Santa Cruz County,California,Spring,Report 11162: Family has sightings and encounters in Santa Cruz mountains,37,-121.7,10/1/2004,11162,Class A,9q96qxsu87,63.77,54.775,45.78,50.55,0.84,0.53,0.61,0,0,,1016.41,Overcast until afternoon.,6,9.97,282,0.78
"It was about 3AM at Lake McCumber, California. I was with my mom, aunt and uncle, and my uncles son and daughter in law. My uncle and his son stayed up all night listening to the strange noise that was somewhere in the meadow. They had no idea of what animal it was, I did. I had heard this noise before. I woke up my mom who didn't want to hear it at all. I bet that the nieghbors across the meadow seen the creature, or at least heard it more clearer than us.

"Here's what I encountered on 4/19/2003, at least the best that I can remember; at the Jones Valley Campground, Lake Shasta, CA. It was about 22:00, slightly over cast and very calm and quiet. In hindsight I remember how odd it was for it to be that quiet on a Saturday night on Lake Shasta. Not even insects were making any noise.I had been sitting in front of a small, almost-out fire for some time when I heard a large tree branch break about 50 yards away. It was sort of an instant 'pop' sound and the branch never hit the ground. Initially it startled me but after about 10 minutes I had just written it off as one of the normal noises that the woods make at night. Then I heard another branch break in the same fashion maybe 10-15 yards from where the first had been broken, again never hitting the ground. Within a minute or two I heard approximately 10 to 13 VERY heavy footsteps heading more or less in my direction. Then after a few more minutes had passed I heard another branch break about 10 yards from were I was. I woke up one of the other fellows that were camping with me and told him something was coming up on us and I had no idea what it was. We then heard about 3 or 4 more footsteps and that was it. My friend took up refuge in the camper at this point. I didn't see anything as it was very dark and whatever this was was in an area of trees. I have been camping in the woods since I was a very young boy and have encountered just about every type of animal there is, at least in California. This was definitely walking on two feet. I'm confident that it was not a bear because they generally don't take very long strides when they stand on two feet. Furthermore most of the bears that I have encountered in this region are black bears and not very large. I'm submitting this in hopes for an explanation.  Was it a deer in season or a rabid bear or what I don't know, I'm at a loss.","An undeveloped campground in Jones Valley, on the way into Jones Valley Resort.",Shasta County,California,Spring,"Report 14323: Possible camp stalking in Jones Valley, Lake Shasta",40.75,-122.1675,4/19/2003,14323,Class B,9r1pu423fy,71.83,57.66,43.49,28.44,0.38,0,0.61,0,0,,1018.21,Clear throughout the day.,9,10,293,1.29
"Hi, my Name is [L. D.] I am 56 Years old and live in Redding California. Last Saturday evening on January 7, 2006, my wife and I drove from Redding to Shingletown about 26 miles east of Redding to see a puppy that we wanted to buy. It was a very dark night with fog like clouds low to the ground, so I had to pay very close attention to the road.  About 6 miles past Shingletown there is a stretch of road that is straight. About 300 feet up the road from the car, I saw this thing walking across the road.  It looked very tall with big long arms. It had a very large walking stride. It walked like it knew a car was coming, because it went up the side embankment of about 12 to 15 feet. I am just a normal man and I know what I saw.

"I was on a family camping trip. There were a lot of us. I was 13 at the time and I had never heard of Bigfoot. The way our camp was laid out was that all of us girls (two sisters, their friends and a friend of mine) were all staying in one big army tent. My brother and his friend were in a smaller tent off to the east closer to the drop off to the lake. Then my parents were in their own tent at the far west end of the campsite. There had been a lot of trouble with bears that summer so all campers were advised to hang their food high up in the trees. My Dad did that and I remember him standing under the bag of food a good three feet over his head about 10 to 15 feet from the door to our tent to the left. My Dad was 5'10"". As for myself, I really wanted to see a bear. I was a very outdoorsy kid and would have preferred to sleep outside of the tent actually. I had little fear of the dark, or the night, and it was my goal to see a bear. I am quit sure we were there for two weeks that year and as I remember it, my sighting occurred about a week in to being there ... since I spent several days after that looking for traces of what I had seen. I slept closest to the door and somewhere during the middle of the night I heard a little stirring outside. Everyone else was asleep and I didn't wake anyone since I had already been informed (emphatically) that no one else wanted to see a bear. I very quietly and carefully crawled to the door of the tent and cautiously stuck my head out the door. I looked over to where the food bag was hanging and saw something that was unquestionably NOT a bear. What I saw was two dark hairy creatures just standing there under the food bag like they were negotiating how to get it down or something. One of them was a good foot taller than the other. My Dad would have come to the bottom of chest of the biggest one. They were just huge! The smaller one was probably just a head taller than my dad. I had that as a gauge after all since I had seen my Dad standing there in the very same spot under the bag, and he hung the food bag in the same place every night. They were VERY tall and very upright. I had never heard of a Bigfoot at that time, but I knew these were not bears. Bears are pear shaped and standing upright isn't a position of comfort for them. For that matter, they don't just 'stand' next to each other like they are carrying on a conversation. The incident took place very quickly. It was fast, but I was VERY impressed and it was clear to me immediately that I was seeing something extraordinary. What happened was that as I saw them, and saw that they were something unexpected, I did one of those surprised intakes of breath ... a true 'gasp' I guess you could say. They heard that and both turned and looked at me. Then, they turned and looked at each other, looked back at me again, and then ... they were just gone. They made not a sound. One moment they were there, and then they were not. I did not go out of the tent. I did think about it, but ... I laid awake all that night thinking about it. I had absolutely no idea what I had seen. The next morning the first thing I did was go out in the direction I saw them leave to see if I could find tracks, but the earth was very hard and dry there. I didn't see anything. It might be that someone more skilled than I was at the time might have found some trace, but I didn't. I did spend a goodly amount of the remainder of that vacation watching and walking in the woods. I recall I even passed on water skiing a few times to go search the woods. I didn't tell anyone what I saw until a few years later. I told NO ONE at the time. I was the youngest in my family and already endured a considerable amount of teasing on a regular basis ... you know, kid stuff. I was not about to tell anyone I saw a 7 foot (or so) tall hairy man creature in the campsite. It would not have gone well. Oh, what I saw of them ... Hairy, with long hanging brown to black hair. I didn't catch any gender features. I just assumed the smaller one was female, but I have no reason to think that since I was mostly just seeing their height ... and the fact that they looked at me ... they LOOKED at me. Uh ... there just aren't words. I did catch that the arms were quite long and they were very big in the chest, shoulders and upper arms, not so much in the hips.  Nope these were not bears at all. I do not recall if there was any strong scent associated with my sighting. I didn't know what I saw until a year or so later when I saw a picture of the famous movie footage. I was so excited to see something that looked like what I had seen. I am 49 now ... I will never forget.","This was at the McCloud Campsite on Lake Shasta.

"In early June 1991 French Gulch, CA. My son and I took a short vacation to my childhood memories trip area to French Gulch where I remembered an eerie thing that happened back in the mid 60's with my father. I had lived with my grandparents in an small town called Summit City just a few miles below Shasta Lake Dam when my father one day took me to French Gulch way way back deep into the woods North and North East of the French Gulch town. I remember always feeling as though being watched and sometimes herd really eerie sounds. I remember the eerie sound that made this worse for me to be comfortable. I was a naturalist though and always felt drawn to the deep woods and so it was hard to keep me from it. In latter years after retiring from the U.S. Army I took a trip visiting relatives in Redding, and one evening I packed up the truck for an deep adventure back to those woods and was their mostly to get those big pine cone's with delicious pine nuts. We left late that evening, getting their as it turned near dark and I felt my memories would help me find the places I had been as an teen with my dad and park and get some sleep and then wake up at some old cabin. It was as if I could practically reach out to the stars that clear bright night and (as well the moon was out partially) some of the ledges on those high peaks were a bit scary driving by them as it was so dark and far down I couldn’t see how far. Then after about three hours of this turn and that and many miles I had forgot to count, and my son fell asleep; I became tired and stopped. I turned off the truck engine and left the headlights on as I saw so many pine cones about an foot or longer and I began to load a few up. I had a camper shell on the little Plymouth arrow Pickup and could lock ourselves in for the night when time came. Before I stopped, I just happened to turn the truck around on the road as it made it easier to load some of the pine cones and as I got out beginning to loading more pine cones, that is when I heard that noise and it was very close. I was petrified at the sound as it is nothing like the elk calls that sound a bit eerie too. I began to slowly pick up a few more pine cones as these were only for decorating for our Christmas seasons and as in my childhood days, I would get the green ones that made it from last autumn and were still on the pine trees as I was still the tree climber. I had reached down to pick up the fifth pine cone and it was then I just froze up and full of panicky fear. I could hear up the side of the ledge, ridge, to my right clearly a heavy pounding of what sounded like something very large. Only two distant sounds pounding the ground and the damn thing was coming fast. I dropped the pine cones at once and ran up to the driver’s side fumbling in fear with the door trying to get in the truck. Then I started the truck up and was trying to put it into 1st gear and jammed it in just as I let out the clutch awaking my 7 year old son. I had heard the sound coming down behind the right rear of the truck just before I got the truck started. I happened to look back in the darkness behind the truck as it darted forward and in the dimness of the tail lights I seen this awful dark hairy figure standing upright behind the truck. The moon and the stars were out which helped me see this figure form as well. I had been stricken with such fear that I had never known before at this moment and nearly drove off the side of the road when my son said, “Dad, watch out !!”. I then nearly flipped the truck over, just missing a small log. I had no gun with me.  I would have not feared what this was, and would have shot in the air as a warning or at it if I had to. It was that darn eerie sound and the sound of the thing coming down the steep hillside, and at that second the issue of absolute fear of not having any defense, that got my spirit stirred. I knew for sure it wasn’t a bear, as that memory is still just as plain to see today. It took a while before my son got me to say what happened on the way back as I was barrowing down the mountain as fast as I could, and am surprised I didn’t forget each turn I had to make on the roads I chose going out on the way back. We just pulled into French Gulch when daylight was breaking and I had to stop and sleep for an hour or so when my son woke me up whining about being hungry.  I woke up a bit dazed and it came back to me what had happened and I started up the truck and headed back for Redding.  My son was teasing me, “Oh dad it was probably just a bear”. We reached Uncle Bills place on the right side of the road well before Redding where he lived on some property of his brothers wife’s Father; an Italian whom passed away. Still to this day my son teases me at his age 23. I was a ranch care taker a few years back in Flagstaff, Arizona, and I had seen a lot of things and heard a lot of things, but nothing that could ever compare to what I experienced on that early morning above French Gulch, and I surely didn’t want to.  I always carried a gun with me on that ranch just the south side of Rodgers Dry Lake even in the surrounding woods. Their were signs posted before entering that forest North of French Gulch stating to keep out during the evening (Night) and cut firewood only during daylight hours.  I hadn’t been their for so many years and wanted to experience what I remembered as an teen, but I sure wouldn’t have if I had known what I would have encountered that night. I’m very serious, because I've studied the Sasquatch or Bigfoot ever since, and would go with someone else today and be a lot more prepared for such an venture, but never again alone like that night and without some serious protection. I have never herd of where this big beast has come up on some one like me and acting like it did, but it sure did with me. I hope someone does get some physical evidence because I haven’t enjoyed being teased all these years; also we could put an end to the mystery of this beast. I've known what it was like to have big bears visit at night up in the high country of the Colorado Mountains, Rabbit Ear Mountain-Pass area, where I camped with wife and our first born.  I’ve been around the world and seen a lot of things from the mountains in West Germany and in South Korea in the Ming Dung Mountains where the Siberian tiger still remained back in 1975. In all those years I have never had such a scare. My body and hands were trembling and I was scared down to the core of my being. Sincerely, Sgt. M.L.D.

"We had driven from the San Francisco Bay Area to Sierra County for a camping trip.  When we arrived, our usual campground was full and we went to a less popular campground which was a few miles further down the road.  By the time we arrived it was already dark and we hurried to set up camp for the night.   Our intention was to camp at this campground for the night and look around the surrounding area for a better site closer to the water the next morning.  Since we has children with us they had to go to the bathroom and my friend (who had spent his youth camping in the area and this campground) took the girls to the closest outhouse while my husband and I started setting up camp.  They came back and everyone was talking about how horrible the area around the outhouse smelled and we laughed saying it was close to end of season and about time to clean out the vault toilets.  Soon we finished setting up tents and unpacking the few things we would need for the night.  I decided I should visit the outhouse and my daughter (who had already been with our friend) said she would show me the way.  We set off down the trail and my husband decided to join us.  We walked down the trail slowly because it was very dark and I had only brought a small flashlight that I always keep in the jeep since we hadn't fully unpacked.  The outhouse was located in an area that was about 10 feet below the trail from the campground.  My daughter finally found the trail down and I flashed my light down into this gullky to look for the outhouse.  I found the outhouse and also found two red eyes looking back at me.  The eyes which were reflected in my flashlight seemed to crouch down.  I  decided that I didn't need to go to the bathroom after all andmade the decision to walk back to camp rather rapidly.  When we got back to camp my husband and friend decided to go back and look around with a better flashlight but found nother although both noticed that it didn't smell as bad as it had before.  The next morning I got up and decided I had to go to the bathroom no matter what was there!  When  got to the outhouse I realized that the eyes I saw reflected back at me had stood about 7 to 8 feet off the ground.

"It must have been late 70’s; my family and I were camping in a very primitive area near Happy Camp, California on a friend of my fathers land. I was around 8 or 10. We were camped on a river, with no one around for miles, and deer would frequently cross the river at our campsite. We kept our trash bagged up approx 30 yards from our camping area to deter bears from being drawn close to the camp area. We had 2 adult dogs and 5 newborn puppies as well. The female dog had pups on the trip. It was late at night approx 10 pm and my sister and I were in our tents sleeping and my parents were at the fire talking. My father put a few paper bags on the fire which caused it to rise quite dramatically and that’s when it started. From approx 50 yards near the trash area, came the loudest shrillest most powerful scream that my first thought was a fire engine (I was young). The adult dogs, including the protective mother started whimpering. They were medium sized dogs, not huge but not small either. The scream started traveling down river at a rapid pace. It died off to a deep growl. Whatever it was, it was very large, you could feel the immensity. You could hear this thing for what seemed to me was an eternity but honestly was probably a good few minutes. I went to the bottom of my sleeping bag and all I can remember is that I was terrified. My sister was awake at this point and the next thing I remember was my father unzipping the tent asking us if we had heard that, we replied and the next question was if we wanted to go or stay. Now, my father was a forest fire fighter for 12 years and an avid hunter and outdoorsman. He was one of the first people to have been helicoptered into a fire in California, and he had heard just about everything in the woods. This man was scared.  Unfortunately he did not bring his rifle with us on that trip he always had his trusty 30-30, why not this time I don’t know. I remember seeing the fear in his eyes, and I was already scared, so it was unanimous. We packed up that night and drove 8 hours to our home in Ventura California. We had never thought about a Sasquatch up until that point. It wasn’t until we were watching an episode of ""In Search Of"" with Leonard Nemoy back in the day that they had what they said was an actual Sasquatch vocalization. I remember all of us watching it in our living room and hearing that noise on the TV and all of us looked at each other, it was the same noise. To this day I wish to god we would have stayed until morning to see footprints or something. My parents were very no nonsense nonbelievers in just about all questionable things. Now we all believe in Sasquatch. Why did the dogs whimper? What was the huge animal that made that sound traveling so fast? What made my father so afraid that he packed us up and we left at midnight for an 8 hour plus drive home? I wish we would have stuck it out until daybreak.",On a very primitive private piece of land right near a river also were at an active animal crossing for the river.,Siskiyou County,California,Summer,Report 13839: Possible vocals heard by family camping near Happy Camp,41.8111,-123.375,7/15/2006,13839,Class B,9r2mbe3p61,93.51,79.43,65.35,48.7,0.38,,0.67,0,0,,,Clear throughout the day.,0,,229,0.68
"I was traveling from San Francisco to visit my daughter, and since the coast was so foggy along highway 1, I went east from Eureka, Ca. to Willow Creek, Ca.  Since I did not want to travel south again to Redding we decided on highway 96 to Yreka, and I-5 as a shortcut. My youngest daughter was with me, and we had driven a long ways and so we gassed up in Willow Creek and decided to continue to drive. It was late and it was a boring uneventful dark drive up this ""Bigfoot Highway 96”, but finally we crossed a bridge on the Klamath River and got to a campground where we finally saw trailers and trucks and people type stuff. The road then goes up a switchback to a ridge for a mile or so, and I slowed my speed down to 25 mph. So, as I got to the ridge, maybe a couple miles from the bridge, I came around this last switchback, and to the right my headlights swept the left embankment and I thought there was a bear coming down the embankment towards the highway. I slowly crept ahead and began to stop as this bear was shuffling down this embankment on two feet, but it was not a bear. I stopped completely and not over one hundred feet in front of me was this thing intent on getting across the road the road in front of me. If I didn't see it on the bank I probably would've hit it, because it was that close. It got to the center line in three long steps and looked at me and then jumped off the road.  I mean from the centerline on its right leg it jumped clear off the pavement and over a two foot embankment and was out of sight. It was not overly tall probably just six feet or a little taller, but extremely was thick maybe in the 300 pound range this thing was built. It was hair not fur and matted and dark brown but with a rusty auburn tint to it. I was extremely close with high beams on, and stopped in the road. It had long arms like a gorilla or something, and it sort of lumbered forward like a gorilla only fast with definite long strides; it had something it was aiming for and when it looked at me it turned its head back straight and this thing jumped off the road like an elk on one leg. It had extremely thick legs and shoulders, and no man could make a jump like that. If I had a video camera in the dash of my car you would have seen the video of your life. I couldn't make out any genitalia it was so hairy I would estimate its body hair like six inches long and matted and dangly, but not so much on its butt or the back of its legs. I could make out the thighs and they were some guns. I was too scared to get out of my car to look over the embankment, that and my daughter was freaked out. Get the heck out of here. I took a picture of the hillside he came down. I can find the exact spot and in fact am on vacation this next week and I got an infrared camera and a motor drive dslr this time, and oh, I ain't getting out of my car without my gun. Don't get me wrong I ain’t a gun freak but I could have rammed this thing with my car the first time. I don't want to hurt anything, but I don't want to get my head ripped off by something just on the other side of the dark roadside either.  This sighting was at 12:55 am and I was wide awake. I checked my odometer from where I saw him it was forty two miles to the next bridge on the river at a small town before I got to the freeway on 96. I am a recreational hunter in my younger years but this isn't something you hunt; this is something you gawk at. Oh and as close as I was the eyes didn't glow. I must have counted 60 deer along that road and I saw eyeballs everywhere in the road along side the road from that ridge to Yreka. This thing didn't have glowing eyes, and I had the high beams on and watched it cross the road and look at me. It didn't have animal eyes that glowed. It struck me that it was going to cross the road and go down to the river and was aware of its purpose like an intelligent being.",The Seiad Valley area of Highway 96!,Siskiyou County,California,Summer,Report 21354: Multi-witness road-crossing sighting on Hwy 96 outside Happy Camp,41.8333,-123.1668,9/11/2007,21354,Class A,9r2mvr88ts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hello, my name is Thomas G., I live in Medford, Oregon, I travel to the Applegate Region, Del Norte,Humbold regions quite often, mostly Applegate in the Red Buttes Wilderness, I had a confirmed sighting June 3, 2009, and have had strange occurances since 07 in this area.  I'm still very emotional about with what I seen, and can describe every moment. I didn't know what was gunna become of me, because it's weird trying to anticipate what it was going to do, it was 50 yards are closer to me, I watched as it ducked behind some brush by a boulder on the hill, looking down upon me. 6-7 foot tall before ducking down behind brush, ovalish head, Reddish/Dark brown fur, I seen the sulight shining off of it's shoulders which were as big as a linebackers with full gear, amber/brown eyes, flat faced, long hair matted, and big ass eyes staring straight through me, I was crippled in fear until the adrenaline started to kick in, and I ran, and jumped down the hill which was about 8 feet above the road, ran into my car, told my friend who was with me by the river, to get into the car now, we need to go, and I didn't stop until I got home, and out of the woods. I had planned to spend the day there swimming, and fishing the Applegate River, I have to say we were only there for less than an hour, 60 miles away from my house, so it'd be a waste of gas to take that trip for only an hour, I left my house at 9:30a.m. and was back by 11:15, I admit I was speeding the whole way to my house.  If it were a bear, it would of crashed off into the woods before I even would of known it was there, cuz it would of known I was there, or if it were a Mountain Lion, I probably wouldn't be typing this to you. I know what I saw, it wasn't a bear or cougar, they don't walk on their hind legs.

"I grew up in Happy Camp CA in which is a small town where Bigfoot is an icon! However, I have never believe in him. On Sunday April 18th, 2010, we saw a massive ""thing"" walking under Independence bridge. It was well over 6 ft tall and was dark and hairy! It was walking like a human! We thought it could of been a bear, but the way it was walking, there's absolutely no chance it was one! I had posted it on my Facebook, and a friend told me to talk to her husband because years ago, around the same area, he swore he saw a bigfoot! This has really sparked interest in me because as an un-believer, I can't come up with another conclusion of what it could of been!

"On December 3 , 2011 we were heading east on hwy 96. We live in Happy Camp Calif. We left around 6pm we were going to Redding Ca. to pick up my son from the Grey Hound Bus station We passed a few cars coming the oppiset direction so every so often I had to dim my head lights. We were about one and a half hours in to the drive. I had to dim my head light's again and as we just passed,8 mile bridge I figured that I should hit the brights lights as we went around a vary slight curve (thats when) I hit the brights at that same moment a large rock (bolder ) stood up (straight up). It looked at us (me) It was a light grey color and had long shaggy hair. It had big eyes that looked yellow ( from the head lights would reflect off an animal?) I drive a 2001 Jeep Cherokee it was a lot bigger (taller) than my Jeep 4x4. It stood vary still except for its head it fallowed the car. When it stood up my mind went blank and I took my foot off the excelorator, we had a vary good long look at him maybe about 15-20 seconds it felt like forever.  The Jeeps head lights were on him the whole time! He seemed vary startled like we spooked him. To me he looked like he was trying to blend in with the surrounding mountain side I wrote a letter and a map I tried to paste it on this form. I had 4 of my children with me and 3 of them had seen him the 4th was asleep this time of year their are lots of rocks all over the hwy we were almost to the I-5 on ramp. When I came back to my senses I screamed so did everyone else and hit the gas and got out of their quickly we drove to the rest area and I had to get out of the car to breathe and stop shaking we all had to calm down. Now any time we have to go to town my son asks me if we are going to Yreka way if so he gets vary afraid.

"I am a law enforcement officer. I have no reason to lie about what I saw and frankly I don't care if anyone believes me. I have heard of these kind of things here and there but never paid close attention to it or laughed it off.  It's not that I didn't believe, I'd just believe it when I saw it. It was a very warm, almost hot evening just after or before labor day in 2007. It was dark, around 8:30 or 9:00 PM but the sky was still a little lit up in the West that time of year.  I was on patrol, driving W/B on Hwy 128 out of Cloverdale going to an alarm call out at some ranch property.  Those calls are very common. As a law enforcement officer, you notice things out of place.  A car here that wasn't parked there yesterday, a person walking along the road in a desolate area, lights on in a closed business....things like that. Things just catch your eye that other people don't notice. Like I said, I was driving W/B and saw someone coming up out of the ravine onto the roadside. I can't describe it...I just saw the movement in the brush and knew it was someone.  People run from us all the time and I thought I may have surprised someone who might be growing marijuana in the woods or something like that. It happens a lot here.  I saw the outline of a body, the reflection of my headlights in it's eyes and it ducked back into the scrub brush before I passed it. Thinking it was someone trying to avoid or hide from me, I hit the brakes and backed up quickly.  That's when I saw it in my headlight beams.  It was about 6-7 ft tall, thick matted brown fur and walking upright. I did not see the face, it was walking away from me but slowly.  Like everyone else says, I couldn't believe what I was seeing.  It was definitely something I was not gonna put out on the radio. There were a lot of branches and overgrowth in the way, but there was no mistake on what I saw. I specifically remember two things.  One was that it had small leaves and grass matted into its fur all over its back. I saw that as it walked away from me.  I remember that vividly. Second, I remember that it used slow, deliberate movements.  It walked away and used its arm to swipe small limbs and twigs out of its way.  I saw it from the backside for a good 4-5 seconds before it disappeared into the overgrowth again.  I then got out of my car and stood there for about 2-3 minutes with the engine off.  I could hear the same slow movements and crunching of leaves and sticks for a while. I could hear it down there making its way into the creek area.  Everytime I stopped hearing it and would start to walk back to my car, I'd hear a ""Crunch"" in the distance and I'd listen a bit longer. There is a creek down in that ravine which is probably where it went back to. Needless to say, I told no one.  This wasn't something to bring up in briefing or to put in the patrol blotter. That would make for an extremely long and uncomfortable career for anyone. A friend of mine from back East told me about this website.  I didn't know who else to contact. I almost contacted one of our Fish & Game Officers up here but he knew too many of my friends, so I just kept it quiet. I read a lot of other postings on here and it's nice to know I'm not alone. I've never seen a ghost, UFO or anything like that, but this really makes me wonder now what else is out there that we laugh off from time to time. ","East/West Highway.

"I was working in the northern part of New Mexico training to be a Wildland Fire Fighter. In September 2003 (maybe the second week of that month) I was dispatched with 22 other people to the Del Loma Fire in the Shasta/Trinity Forest area, the Northern part of California. Each Crew had about 20 people, our plane that left Albuquerque held 2 crews. For almost the whole two weeks, we were all on standby. On the 4th to the last day of our 2 weeks of Fire call, we were setting up camp close to a river, about 5-10 miles out from the original forest fire. It was close to sun down when, a couple of guys were amazed at something. I heard them from inside my tent, but just ignored the whole thing until one of my crew members came and pulled me out of my tent. I had no idea what I was supposed to be looking at or for. He pointed across the river and I was in shock when he pointed out the biggest, hairiest mammal I had ever seen just walking along the river side minding his own business. It stopped and looked at us. The way he stood on his hind legs was like an ordinary human. He had dark, long hair and stood about 7ft tall with a muscular build. At this point I was the 4th person standing there in amazement. Maybe about 5 minutes of watching him watch us, with more people coming out with flashlights (because the sun was still going down) he darted in to the trees. He was running, taking long strides, and was gone in about 3 seconds.....and was literally pushing trees out of his way (not breaking them, but  pushing them out of his way). The trees behind him on his path up the mountain were swaying back and forth. I was surprised to see to these trees moving because they are thick in width and very tall. By this time it was dark but lit enough to see which way he was headed. Up the mountain a little, there was a clearing, where we spotted him again before he disappeared for good. He made no noise, no yelling or screaming. He was just as timid as can be.

It walked around for at least a minute so I whispered my brothers name to see if it was him but it kept walking around and not responding which made me very nervous.

"My family and I were at The Golden Trout Wilderness Packing Station in the lower Sierra's over the labor day weekend. We were there for horse back riding which we have done for the past 4 years. The time was approximately 4PM when my wife, son, daughter, Sierra(daughter of the owner of the pack station), and myself became aware of a high pitched ""whooping"" call coming from a distance down the forestry access road approaching the station. The kids started to call back in the same manner. We all guessed it was an approaching hiker or horse back rider approaching the station and calling out for fun. The calling continued for the next 15-20 minutes and was percieved as getting closer. My son became bored with the game and went on to something else to do. The calling continued and I observed that it passed the station and finally grew faint towards the trail head entering a section of the golden trout wilderness area. My daughter went to the access road just adjacent to the mule packing platform to greet the caller upon their arrival. The call grew louder and that was the reason for her appearence at the road at that time. She observed a being and was afraid of what she saw. When I asked later that evening whom had come down the road she was timid in her response. I thought this odd and continued to question her. She was afraid to tell us what she saw because she thought we would accuse her of lying. She has just turned eight. Her description was as follows with little lead in by myself or my wife. We are both physicians and trained in the scientific method. We tried or best not to ""bait"" her answers: The thing was bigger than me (>7 foot) and had a long beard. When I asked her what he was wearing she answered nothing. I then asked her what color was his skin and she answered that she could not tell because he was covered with hair. All over I asked, yes, all over. I then asked if his arms were short or long. She answered long. I asked did he see you and her answer was no. I asked if he made the sound we had been hearing and she stated not at the time she saw him. I then described three different gait patterns by example and she picked the long stride and lumbering type verses the noraml human gait or small steps. She stated that he had a big mouth and walked quickly. She was brief and direct with her answers and I believe she saw something not typically human in form. She has no imaginary friends and has been taught that lying will only hurt the one who lies.

"My family and I were camping in Monache Meadows, on the north side of Monache Mountain. Sometime late on May 26 or early May 27, my wife and I were startled by loud, echoing whoops. The whooping came in groups of two, a few moments of silence and then another pair. It seemed fairly near, perhaps 100 to 200 yards south of us, toward the slope of the mountain. The whoops were intense and were soon joined by howling coyotes. A chase seemed to erupt and the sounds began retreating away from us. It was not clear whether the coyotes were giving chase or being chased. But as the uproar receded, it sounded as though something was being attacked, given a series of yelps and high-pitched howls. It sounded extremely violent. ""Whatever it was,"" my  wife said the next morning, ""it was being torn apart."" After a minute or two, the chase faded into the distance.

"It was the summer of 1986 and I was camping with a friend in a small campsite where we had been several times before. It was a few hundred yards off the road before Fish Creek campground, near Troy Meadows area on the Kern Plateau, up the road from Kennedy Meadows. The public campground was about 1 ½ miles as the crow flies from us. I believe it was a Wednesday so there were not many other campers on the mountain, and we were on the first day of a motorcycle riding trip. We had spent the day gathering wood, setting up tents and testing out our old motorcycles. Two friends were to join us the next day. As my friend Bob and I settled in around the campfire, we talked of the loop we were planning to ride the next day. We were camped in a clearing in the trees. There was a large meadow 100 yards on the other side of the trees. Bob’s dog Duke, a large male Irish setter, was taking turns getting petted. It was getting late and we were winding down. Just then we heard it. The sound was part yell, part growl. It was extremely loud and echoed through the valley. Only a very large pair of lungs could have produced the loud, high tones and deep throaty growl. This sound struck fear in me that I will never forget. It continued for several minutes and seemed to be at the edge of the meadow. It is hard to describe the intensity of the sound. The best I can do is to say that it started off sounding like the yell of a howler monkey, fading into the deep growl of an enraged grizzly bear. We stoked up the fire without saying a word to each other. Next we heard a branch break just outside the light of the campfire. I looked at Duke and saw him staring at the area where I had heard the branch break. He was shaking from head to toe. Next we heard leaves move about fifty feet over from the last sound. The dog turned straight at it. Again, it was just out of the light of the fire. Bob and I were scared like never before. Our fear was emphasized by the fact that his large male dog was frozen in fear, fixed on one area in the darkness. By the look in his eyes, I believe he could see what we could not. Several minutes later, the dog slowly broke his stare for a minute. Bob and I were able to talk after this point. All we could come up with to explain the noises was that it was large, not a bear, and very angry by the sound of it. We never calmed down that night. We abandoned the tents and both slept in Bob’s Ford Bronco, Bob with his 357 lying across his chest. The next day, we waited until we heard other cars and far off bikes before we started really walking around. Later our friends arrived and we kept the camp loud all of the next night.

"September 29, 2008 I’m in the mountains above Kernville for opening weekend deer hunting season. I decided to spend the evening on a high mountain ridge so I would not have to climb the mountain in the dark the next morning. I hiked in the afternoon before and pitched my tent just before dark. I pitched my tent on a ridge just down from a high mountain pass. Just before going to sleep I was standing outside my tent and I heard a loud noise behind me. The noise was within forty feet of my position, and I would describe it as a single pop sound. I’ll try to spell out the sound, but there is no way I can reproduce the sound! “Pooeekk”. It could have been a branch being broken off of a tree but it would have had to come off at the base of the branch where it meets the tree trunk. The tree would have to be slightly hollow to get the sound. There was no noise after the initial sound and nothing ever hit the ground. My first impression of the sound was that it was a warning and I thought it was more of an animal sound, because it had a hollow guttural tone to the pop sound. I dismissed the occurrence and had no other problems through the night. The next morning I got up before sun up and started stocking along the tree line heading toward the mountain pass. After about 75 yards I moved into the trees and sat for some time looking over a meadow. Once I finished my time there I walked in the trees for twenty feet and then I moved out of the trees and back in the open. Just as I stepped out of the trees I spotted a large foot print. It was very large and I could make out two toes at the top left of the print. At this point I took out my cell phone and snapped a picture of the foot print. The foot print was as long as my boot, 13” long plus the toes and 2” wider than my boot on the side. I could make out a ridge in the dirt where the ball of the heal and the middle of the foot come together. After taking the picture I resumed my hunting and I moved along the tree line following the foot prints. They were made by a man like biped creature, the stride was longer than mine are, but I could stretch my stride to match the stride. I followed the prints for about another 75 yards they went right through the middle of the saddle between the two mountains.  At that point I resumed my hunting for deer and dismissed the Bigfoot. The only thing I would add about the prints they were all the same, but I could only see the toes on the first print because that print went slightly into the side of the mound. I will send a copy of the picture once you make contact with me. Both the toes and skin fold mound can be seen in the digital picture.",The area is located south of the Sherman Pass Road about a one hour drive out of Kernville.

"I took a trip over the fourth of July to visit a friend in Modesto.  We traveled to Tuolumne County, past Sonora, and camped off of Gargoyle trail above Strawberry on the night of July 4th.  We got to the camp site at about 4:00pm and set up.  My two friends took a nap after setting the tent up but I decided to look around, so I took a hike down a dirt road that lead into the forest.  I was hiking around when my friend came to look for me.  We hiked further into the forest and found a big rock formation and climbed up.  The top was about the size of a football field.  On top we found three stacked rocks and took some video of it.  The bottom rock was big, it came up to my shins and the top two were smaller. Maybe five pounds each. We then went off into the unknown on the other side of the rock formation.  We had to hike down a lot of boulders and the brush was getting pretty thick.  It was now probably 7:00 or 7:30 so the sun was disappearing and it was getting dark.  As we got closer to the trees I felt as though we were being watched.  Just my imagination I thought, so we hiked on.  This feeling remained and I started to think about how long it would take to get up the rocks we were clibing down. Besides if something was watching us it could have been a bear.  I convinced my friend to go back to camp and we did. At about 8:30 or 9:00 my friend heard rocks being clinked together of in the distance and he said they were answered off in the opposite direction.  I didn't believe him but soon I heard the clinking too.  It was fast but obviously not a wood pecker.  My friend commented that the pattern seemed not human, but I thought it could have been. This banging went on for about twenty minutes and then quit.  We went to sleep later and didn't hear anything all night.  I did notice it was a moonless night and the forest was pitch black.  The next morning we got up and I checked for foot prints around the camp fire were I cleared everything within five feet but saw nothing.  As we were packing up we heard the banging off in the distance again so I decided to try and copy the patterns.  I tried using two rocks and the sound wouldn't carry.  So I then tried a rock on a log.  Finally I settled on a small branch on the log because it sounded to me like what was coming from the forest.  The banging was repititious with a pattern on the end.  I mimiced the banging for about ten minutes before it stopped answering me.  I started packing up again and we heard it another time so I tried to answer it.  No answer.  It did it again, I answered, no answer.  There were long pauses in between my responces and its banging.  I got the feeling what ever it was, wanted to continue it's banging but not in response to me.  We finished packing up and left.","Take Highway 108, past Strawberry to the Trail of the Gargoyles.",Tuolumne County,California,Summer,Report 4650: Campers find stacked rocks and hear unusual rock banging near Strawberry,38.24805,-119.9924,7/4/2002,4650,Class B,9qf9tdb5n3,,,,,,,0.81,,,,,Clear throughout the day.,0,,126,5.08
"I was traveling with my father and my fathers friends. Now i should tell you that my father was an active hunter, hiker and outdoorsman. My father was also 6'3 and two hundred and fifty pounds. There where exactly 6 of us including my self. We had traveled to the end of forest route 3n83 and had planned to camp in the general area for the night. Later on my father and told me that all this was planned so i could get used to hunting, and camping, this was a surprise for my 13th birthday. he said that we were supposed to spend two days there. We began to travel east of the end of the road. We walked for about 20 minutes through moderatley dense underbrush and reached a clearing where my dad decided to teach me how to make a fire. After around two hours i finally succeeded in making a fire. At around 4:30pm I finally made a fire. At this time my father decided to camp here, his friends agreed and set about setting up camp. Now as they set up they talked about there other hunting experiances, me being young and stupid i decided to re-enact some of the stories. I decided to walk in a general east direction playing with a stick pretending it was a rifle. I eventually got to a smaller clearing and saw a squirell or some other small mammal and decided to chase it. It ran across the clearing and up the nearest tree. I threw two rocks at it and then became bored. So i continued in the direction i was headed. I came to an area where the tress thinned and i could see a meadow. At this time it had just begun to get dark. I turned around to go back to the camp when I noticed a terrible odor. It smelled like a very large wallowy pig. I covered my nose and continued walking. I began hearing brush breaking about 50 -100 feet behind me. At this time i noticed that me father and his friends had begun to look for me and I could hear them calling. As soon as i could hear the voices the brush breaking stopped so i ran back to the camp. When i got back to where they were they had already started to pass around beef jerky and water. I sat next to my father and awaited the food. That night i was in a tent with my father who was sound asleep, when i thought i heard some brush breaking. We had divided our group into three tents, two in each. I sat there very still not sure what to do but i felt that something was wrong. I quietly woke up my dad to tell him about the sound. He woke up and I motioned him to be quiet and he heard the brush breaking around the edge of our camp. He grabbed his hand gun, and yelled whos there? The brush breaking stopped and then the area got quiet. My dad cocked the safety back and yelled again. This time there was a kind of crashing noise like a branch snapping, and then it got quiet. My dad crept form the tent and checked on the others, they were woken up by my dads yelling and had heard the crash. They lit a fire and remained awake the rest of the night. The food we had hung 6 feet to 7 1/2 feet of the ground was gone. The branch it was on had broken about a foot's length from the trunk of the tree, the branch there was at least 4 to 6 inches in diameter.  There was also the faint wallowy odor in the forest around the clearing. We packed our stuff up and left the woods.

"Christmas Eve 2003, my wife and I spent XMas in Twain Harte, CA with friends.  This area is deep in the Sierra Mountains and has plenty of snow during the winter months. We stayed at our friends’ cabin, which sleeps twelve people with no problem. The cabin is about six to eight feet off the ground and the only way in is by using wooden stairs to climb into it. There was plenty of snow and we were warned about walking on the porch. To get to the porch we had to go through the house.  The cabin was warm with the great wooden heater even though the windows had no coverings. Christmas Eve was upon us and the traditional events came and went.  After midnight, everyone eventually went to bed and retired for the night.  I was sleeping in a room by the porch and the windows like I said before, had no curtains or shades. I could see very little from all the windows except for one, which was near the outside porch light.  I could see a small portion of the porch from that window.  I went to sleep as did everyone else, but was awakened several hours later.  There was a slight movement all around the cabin like a small earthquake.  I turned over thinking just that. Moments later, I felt movement again but this time it felt like someone was walking on the porch.  I sat up to look around and did not see anything or anyone. I decided to use the restroom since I was awake and eventually found my way back to bed.  It was then that I noticed something moving by the porch light. At first, I thought it was a man with long brown hair, but then noticed that it had hair on its arms and back. After a better look, it had hair all over its body, but it seemed more of an orange-brown color.  Frightened as can be, I just kept looking at this thing.  It had its back towards me for several minutes and then slowly turned to look in my direction.  I was about twenty feet from the window so I am certain that it did not see me.  It leaned over to see through the window.  I would estimate it to have been about six foot six inches tall.  Its weight was about three hundred pounds and well proportioned.  I compared  compared the beast to a friend who is six foot two inches tall and weights three hundred pounds.  It looked fairly young like a teenage boy. There was also no odor as this thing walked around.  The face was more like a caveman but very sad looking.  I could barely see its eyes in the dark, but I noticed them when it looked left and right. They seemed to be dark brown. The beast was frightening when it turned and looked in towards the window.  Its chest was like that of a male and I am assuming that it was not quite a grownup yet.  It was searching for something but I don’t know what.  I also noticed that our friend’s dogs were no where to be heard or found in the cabin. After a quick scan of the room, it turned and headed towards the porch rail.  Eventually, it jumped from the porch, which was a six to eight foot drop.  In the morning, I did not mention this event to anyone nor did I go looking for evidence. I believe there are different species scattered around the world.  I always believe they existed but my thoughts were reinforced with this citing.  This is also the first time anyone has heard or read this story from me.",I've only been there twice and there are so many streets to turn too that I still have no idea how to get to the cabin.

"On 7/3/06 around 4:35pm, I (age 42) took my two sons, ages 7 & 8 to a nearby lake while my husband stayed behind to continue building our cabin. It's a hard 23 minute, offroad drive of 4.3 miles, so we were very specific about our departure and return times, just in case my husband would need to come looking for us. After unsuccessfully looking for a wading spot near our truck, (mucky water, underwater plants and drop-offs) the boys and I made quite a trek to a prior favorite point that juts out like a partial island, with fishing nets, swimsuits and snacks. The path has become almost non-existent due to fallen trees, branches and almost no foot traffic. This is a very remote lake, not visible from any main forest service road. Our whole trip consisted of 1 1/3 hours at the lake. We were dipping our toes and talking about the fish, when I said we needed to pack it up. I had just heard a noise in the far distance of what sounded like a single, medium tone ""whoop or yup"" (#1). I told the boys to be quiet for a minute and this time we all heard it (#2). None of us could identify it, so I yelled, ""Hello?"" and waited. It responded again with a single ""whoop"" (#3) which sounded significantly louder.  The boys caught on to this right away, and said, “Mom, it’s getting closer”.  We thought it might be a hurt backpacker off in the distance, so I yelled, ""Is anybody out there?"" Each response was about 30-60 seconds and this time it was very loud and close (#4). I thought someone was playing a joke on us at first, but realized I could neither see, nor identify the sound. The frightening issue was that no other sound was made as it approached us. I expected sticks and twigs to be snapping, so I wrote it off as some curious bird moving quickly between trees (mostly for the boys sake).  There was a golden mantel chipmunk in the distance that was very upset about something, but everything else was eerily quiet. I felt like we were being watched the whole time, but never said anything because I didn't want to spook the boys.  I experienced the same ""watched"" feeling the last time we were at that spot (last year) and remember hearing what I thought was a deer walking around us, but I never saw anything. We packed up fast and bee-lined it to the pickup. I did not want to be stuck on a spit of land with two young kids that are just learning to swim. I could have made it across the lake to the truck, but not the boys. It sounded like a cross between a human and animal that was made by something very large. It was absolutely not a bird (quail/woodpecker), bear or cougar sound. Last year on two separate occasions, we had a young cougar, then a bear run in front of our pickup and we're very familiar with their ""walking and verbal""  sounds. I have been camping all of my life and have never experienced that sound before. I had my digital camera with me and never once thought to put it in Video mode to record the sounds. The whole thing took place over a 5 minute period and we were just focusing on getting back to the pickup. I was born and raised in Port Orchard, WA, so I'm very familiar with Sasquatch and BigFoot tales. I have always felt they could be real, but have never had any encounter with one. I decided to poke around online to see what a Yeti might sound like and read John Bindernagel's research. My hair stood on end and I called my husband at work who thinks the whole thing is fabulous. I also read about the BFRO expeditions in Northern California and Humboldt County, along with a lot of other information and projects. I decided to respond to you with my information for whatever it’s worth.  I can’t explain it, and both of the boys have very vivid and accurate memories of what we all heard.

"I was tent camping with my wife and daughter along Trout Creek about 1/2 mile west of the Clavey River. I woke up early but just laid in my sleeping bag for while. All of a sudden, I heard the ""scream"" which continued for 20-30 seconds and then it started again for about the same length of time. I thought I was the only one awake at the time but when I turned my head to look at my wife, her eyes were wide open. She turned her head to look at me and we both had that ""yep, that's what it is"" look. She was kind of freaked out about it but I was rather excited as I have been interested in seeing or hearing some kind of bigfoot evidence.

"I was just about to go to bed for the night when I took my dog outside for a quick walk. The area around my house is very densely wooded and my backyard is so forested that it's hard to see in the dark more than maybe 20 feet in. As I was about to head back inside I heard what sounded like a person walking through the brush about 80 yards out. Because of the time, I was curious as to who was walking in my backyard and decided to stay silent and observe rather than calling out. After a few moments of silence there was continued wrestling in the trees and what sounded like the snapping and breaking of branches. My dog started a low growl and the movement in the trees stopped. A few seconds later, there was a deep, loud growl in the trees. I told my dog to be quiet, but she barked at the noises causing the creature in the trees to start a progressive scream which at its peak was so loud I am sure it was not human. I went back inside immediately, but my dog continued to growl at the noises for quite some time. I didn't have a view of the yard from my room because of a stairway in the way, but I continued to hear the creature vocalizing over the next ten minutes.

"I was up off old strawberry road on sunday afternoon about 4pm. Take left before you get to strawberry proper off 108. I was getting the dogs out of the truck. Its a one lane old road, there was a turn about 300 yards away. I caught something out of the corner of my eye, looked up and saw the top halves of what I took to be two people walking across the street very quickly with their hoods up (I assumed hoods because of the peak on the head). They were almost across the street and at the point in the curve where I could not see them anymore... when I looked up. I figured they would be coming toward me or I would be able to see them going away from me as there is no trail up the hill from where I saw them and they crossed at a turn in the road where I could not see, but could see the road before and after the turn.

"I was camping with my dad at Bear Lake in Emigrant National Wilderness. I had just woken up from a loud strange sound, I put my boots on and got out of the tent and heard a very loud howling noise comign from the top of the cliffs nearby.

"The town of strawberry is about 10 miles from Beardsley Lake. Myself, my ex, both of her parents, and some friends (who happened to be in another car ahead of us) were on our way up to Beardsley Lake to go camping. It was just after dark and our friends (who are very catholic) had just crossed the bridge saw something cross the road from left to right just ahead of them. We (in our car) were just behind them maybe like a minute and as we got to the other side of the bridge I was facing my ex talking to her and just over her should I saw something about 9 or 10 feet tall walking like it was walking through the brush. It turned and looked right at the car and I got a very good look at it and realized it was a Bigfoot. I wasn't scared. I instantly got excited and grabbed my camera and start telling my ex's mother, who was driving, to pull over so I could get pictures. She refused. We continued up the highway following our friends and I watched as they pulled over. I though maybe they missed the road to turn off to go to the lake so we pulled over too. Our friend's husband rolled down the window leaned out and screamed, ""What the hell just walked in front of my car?"" What I saw was about 9 or 10 feet tall, covered in dark (like black or dark brown) hair, long arms ( longer then a normal mans) its face was like every picture i have ever seen and it walked down towards the river and up into the woods. It walked like it was moving the brush out of its way. And when it looked at the car its eyes were red. I think that was due to the headlights and other few lights around. We then finally got to the lake our friends and myself talked about it and I told them what it was. Nobody else in my car saw it but both people in the other car saw it.

I made the mistake of reading a bunch of your stuff prior to the trip, and I admit that I was on ""high alert"" that first night. However, around 2:30 or so in the morning of Friday, July 25th, 2008 (just three days ago), I heard some kind of vocalization that was not familiar to me. I was not happy to hear this, honestly. I suppose I ought to be since I have held an avid interest in this subject for years, but there is a whacking big difference between sitting safely in your home reading about this stuff on the net, and listening to something make funky noises in the dark woods of a forest. As my best friend said, ""I used to really like the cabin..."" I got out of the tent to wake up my husband, who was sleeping on the ground by the unused fire pit. We both sat and listened to the sounds for about an hour and a half, or so. To the best of my ability, this is what we heard: Loud, clear, not-shrill sounding (to me, the Puyallup calls sound somewhat metallic and shrill), medium-range, and smooth sounds. They began lower in pitch and would rise smoothly to end at a higher pitch, but not like the whoops that you have recorded. These didn't have that ""lilt"" at the end. It was just a smooth ascent from low range up to a higher range. There was another call that sounded like what a contraction looks like. (Forgive me, I'm not sure how to describe it but it made me think of what my contractions looked like on paper when birthing my kids), beginning low, smoothly rising up to a higher level, and then smoothly descending down again. There was also a kind of a hiccup sort of sound that would directly follow some of the calls, but I was literally shaking and too freaked out about it to really pay attention to what kind of call it followed: the upswing, or the contraction call. Anyhow, as I said, this went on for over an hour with the two of us listening. Sometimes it would sound like it was moving near to us. Other times it sounded further away. I am not sure if there were two animals, thus accounting for the near/far sounds, or one. If it was two animals, they sounded identical to me. After this happened, we both tried to explain how big/far the sounds were to us. We both agree that it sounded somewhat distant, but find it hard to tell since sound might carry really well in a dead-silent forest. We agree that it sounded to be between a half a mile and a mile away. We also agree that it was a large sound. Whatever made it sounded effortless on its part, but was a very large sound. We believe that it is a sound of ""size"" similar to, say a very loud moo of a cow across a field. I'm digging here because I've never had any experience like it so I don't have much I can truly compare it to. I grew up in Washington State, west side. I'm a Biology minor with a Life Science teaching credential, so I am familiar, at least, with what wildlife looks like and sounds like in videos, if not in person. But most of my personal encounters with wildlife have been animals of the smaller variety: coyote yips and howls things like that. I've only heard larger animals on wildlife programs and I am holding out the hope that one of your specialists will call me back and explain that what we heard was just a ""such and such"" and often is confused with a Big Foot call. I'd be able to enjoy the cabin a lot more if you could do so. But, I know you won't, because this was a very strange sound, and even my mathematician-husband, who is grounded in science and wasn't afraid like I was, stated that it sure was loud, and that it wasn't like anything he'd ever heard before. It sounded like an animal, but it also sounded enough like a person to think it could have been a joke, but not exactly. I do not think I could replicate the sound.","Big Preather Meadows, a private preserve and association.

"An unknown ape-like creature walked upright out of the thick patch of bushes and stood looking, for several seconds, up and down the fire lane.  I cocked the hammer back on the .32 caliber carbine, shouldered the weapon, and began to press the trigger.  Something in my mind ordered me to not shoot the creature!  I call it Devine intervention. I asked myself if this was a bear?  No, I instantly decided that it didn’t look like a bear because there was not a long, protruding snout jutting out from the face.  Besides, bears were not legal game in this area of California.  It certainly was not a buck, never mind the fact that if it was a deer there were no horns on this animal.  I immediately told myself it looked like a “monkey man”.  I can hear myself today saying these words out loud:  “What the hell is a monkey doing out here in the mountains”?  In the meantime, as I made the move to shoulder the carbine, and spoke those words, the big animal turned towards me from the waste up.  Looking over the sights of the little carbine, I observed this being to be about 7 or 8 feet tall, with well-muscled, long hairy arms hanging down to the waist. The hands looked almost human; I remember noticing these things as I slowly put down the gun.  This creature was completely covered in long dark, brown hair, from head to feet and appeared to have a huge, barrel chest.  Some other striking features that I noticed were a flat, square jawed face; a flat, dark looking nose; no noticeable hair on the face; and a “sloping fore head”.  I don’t remember seeing any sign of ears on the animal – too much long hair around the side of the head – and there was no discernable neck.  Since I had no idea what this creature was, I’ve always been glad to have instantly decided NOT TO SHOOT IT!  Thank God for protective Angles?  The other thing I thought about, at the time, was this could be some idiot in a “monkey suit” playing a prank on some hunter like me.  But, then, only a “village idiot” would dress up in a monkey costume and roam around the mountains during deer hunting season.  As I contemplate the incident today, I realize now that this was a Bigfoot!  And, it had both seen and heard me.  I could not tell what sex it was because of all the long, dark hair around the body.  However, now that I have seen numerous showings of the Patterson film in which “Pattie” was documented, I must guesstimate it was male in gender?  Within 10-15 seconds, as quickly as the creature had entered my field of view, it calmly made about two strides across the open fire lane, parted some tall bushes with well-muscled, uplifted hairy arms, and disappeared into the thick bushes. Right away I noticed that it was now standing inside the screen of thick brush along side of the fire land like it was watching me.  I could readily discern the huge dark shape, as it stood there for possibly a minute or so.  Apparently, it was looking at me sitting up the hill on the ground.  I didn’t know at the time whether it was going to attack me or leave.  I kept the little carbine in the “ready position” across my chest and slowly stood up to get a better look at this unknown animal. I decided at the moment when I stood up that, that if this thing would “charge” me, I was going to run back up the hill to my dad - unless it got too close to me.  Then, and only then, would I consider shooting the animal!  I admit it – I was scared fit to wet my pants.  I now recall seeing the bushes shake violently and the dark shape stepped out of sight.  I slowly sat down again and listened to its rustling footsteps as the huge “ape-man” descended down the hill away from me.  Boy was I glad it was gone.  Now the shakes started.  If I had been smoking in those days, I would have lit a cigarette and probably smoked the whole pack.  Finally, after about 15-minutes, when the stillness was broken by singing birds and scurrying chipmunks, I got up enough nerve to carefully go down to the spot where I had seen this creature.  Was I dreaming?  No, because there, in the loose dirt, I saw a couple of huge, human-like, barefooted tracks where it had crossed the fire line. Then, a raunchy odor hit my nose.  I remember thinking it smelled like a horrendous fart.  In fact, at the time, I decided to call it the “Fart Creature”.  I know, that is not a very endearing name for such a marvelous being, but that’s how my scared brain was working that fateful morning. Deciding that now would be a good time to leave the area; I quickly walked back up the hill to where I had been sitting and stood there for a few minutes.  Clearly, I had seen something unexplained.  Now I had to decide if I should tell my dad or just keep quiet.  To tell you the truth, I was afraid to tell my father because I knew he would never believe me.  I thought he would most certainly take my hunting privileges away for seeing “buggers in the hills”.  I began slowly walking back up the firebreak towards my father in the piney flats above me.  I remember now that he had asked me why I had left my deer stand so early.  I think I replied that I was hungry and bored at not seeing a buck right after daylight.  He probably chewed me out for leaving so early, but, at least, I didn’t incur his wrath for telling a “bugger” story! Honestly, for many years I forgot about this incident.  I had to go back to military school the next week and the ensuing years later my life was filled with other things.  Of course, I really never did totally forget about seeing a Sasquatch!  It was only later on in life, after getting married, serving in the military, and leaving California for Florida, that this sighting began to trouble my conscious. How I kept this a secret for this many years I will never know.  I guess I was frightened that people would think I was crazy?  Usually, I’m the blabby type, sharing plenty of secrets with almost anybody, especially family or friends.  But this deal, oh no – I kept these cards close – too close for too long, really! I swear to all persons reading this report that the facts documented here are recalled to the best of my ability after 44 years and one month in the past! ____________R.R.R._____________  Friday, September 12, 2008  p.s.

"I was hunting with my close friend Chris R. in Sonoma County, CA on our family property that is adjacent to Pine Mountain.  We were walking along an old camp road that had become overgrown with brush and scrub. It was obvious that bear had been using this trail as there was a considerable amount of bear sign along the old road.  We got to a point in the trail where there was an overhang of pine limbs over a slight depression on the right side of the old road.  Upon inspecting the depression we noticed what appeared to be a left foot print, and a right leg outstretched in the pine needle cover on the ground.  We continued to survey the area, and noticed what appeared to be more tracks leading away from this overhang and depression.  I took photos with a disposable camera.  I have the prints, but they did not come out very clear.  Which was a disappointment, but something to look at nonetheless. We finished poking around, and continued on our way.  We got just a bit further down the trail, and we walked through an extremely strong smell of skunk, or wet dog-like odor.  No sooner had you smelled it that is disappeared, but if you took a few steps back it was extremely strong again. I have been hunting and recreating outdoors for many years, and I am very familiar with skunk spray, and how it seems to permeate a large area.  This was not simply the spray of a skunk.  It was very centralized.  It was literally like you walked through it, and it disappeared, then you could turn around and walk through it again. The two of us spent a few moments looking around, and we noticed, something very peculiar.  In the middle of the trail and not far from this smell, and the foot prints we had seen, was a large pile of oak acorns.  The strange thing was there was not an oak anywhere near this pile of acorns!  They seemed to have been placed in this location.  They were not a collection of shells from squirrels, they were fresh dropped acorns.  Enough to hold a hungry deer, or two for a little while. We theorized that whatever had been hunkered down under the pine overhang in the depression may have placed these acorns, then set up under the overhang off of the trail in ambush. Our intent was to walk to the back of Pine Mountain, then still hunt our way up to the top of the mountain.  We had used this road for years to access the back of the mountain, and we were very used to the topography, so anything out of the norm would be noticeable to us. Chris and I team hunt very well together and after a short strategy chat, decided to use a 50 step method: one of us would go 50 steps, stop and whistle to let the other hunter know it was their turn to take 50 steps, and then just watch and listen.  We were approximately 130 yards apart. The ground was covered in heavy and dry leaf litter so the going was somewhat noisy.  I had gone nearly three quarters of the way to the saddle at the top, and I heard what sounded like a whistle, but not the whistle I recognized as Chris'.  I also heard what sounded like a very large boulder break loose and roll down the back of the hill.  I had assumed that Chris had rolled it down hoping to kick something out, but based on the last whistle, this rock was rolled from that area, and seemed to be 60 yards to my right, when Chris would have been twice that distance away from me.  I though that maybe he had gotten closer to me as we made our way up, but that would not have been the case in the past.  We work very well together and spacing is everyhting on our team hunts. We got to the top of Pine Mountain, and we had a discusion and he told me that he thought I had rolled the boulder, and vice versa.  I told him about the whistle, and he told me the exact same thing.  He also had this overwhelming feeling of being followed up the hill.  Like something was timing it's footfalls so as to not be detected.  I have to admit, I felt this way too, even more so after the discussion about the boulder.","Dry Creek Road comes off of Highway 29 out of Middletown, Dry Creek Road goes into the back country through much privately owned land, to our ranch.

"During the last week of June, my girlfriend and I decided to take the dogs on a long walk. We were driving up the coast planning on a beach walk when I decided to go to a area on redwood creek where my friend had heard some unusual and scary whistles and screams. He is a very experienced hunter and outdoorsman with a degree in wildlife biology and he had never heard anything like it. Anyway, we were walking up the north bank, where the trails are, when I decided to cross to the south bank to check out some sandbars. I loaded up my girlfriend on my back and waded across. We then continued upstream a shortways when we came across three distinct footprints. They were approximately 14 1/2 inches long. I measured them with a stick that I saved. I compared them with my own barefoot track for depth and they were nearly twice as deep. I weigh about 280 lbs. I was surprised that they weren't wider, they were almost narrow for their length. I at first thought they were human because of this.  The best print had 5 very distinct toes and was flat, no arch at all, with toes straighter across than a normal human. It appeared that it had just leisurely walked into the creek. I scoured up and down for an exit point but the terrain wasn't suitable for tracks other than the odd sand bar. The strides were about 4 feet. It had come across a packed gravel bar leaving a few faint impressions.

"Last Sunday (November 16, 2003) My friend, my dog and I traveled from Portland, OR to Northern California for some late season backpacking. We stopped at the Aikens Creek campground (West of Orleans, CA and just west of Bluff Creek on HWY 96) at approximately 6:00pm, as it was too late to hike in anywhere that evening and the Six Rivers NF website listed it as one of the campgrounds open through November. As we neared the pay station a sign deferred us to render payment directly to the campground host, and as we approached the host's site it became clear that the site was vacant with just a few small items left behind. So, we took the liberty to drive in and explore the portion of the campground that was open. Driving near the Southern edge (nearest to the Klamath river) we smelled a pervasive ""skunky"" odor, but thought nothing of it at the time. Eventually we pulled into a campsite (second or third from the entrance at the foot of a large hill). Our intent was to get out of the pickup (leaving the dog inside), get on our rain gear and set up the tent as quickly as possible, as it was already quite dark and raining. Just after donning my rain gear, however, I heard some distinct ""hoots"" from within the woodline which were decidedly not owl-like nor quite human-like, but could be most accurately likened to those of an ape. I asked my friend if he had heard that, but he had not, as he had two hoods pulled up over his head. I quickly scanned the woodline with my head lamp, seeing nothing out of the ordinary through the dark and rain. We began setting-up the tent when I heard it again. ""There."" I said, ""Did you hear it that time?"" ""No."" he responded, but he did pull his hoods down. Shortly thereafter we both heard another set of ""hoots"". ""What do you think that is?"" he asked. I have had a casual interest in the Sasquatch phenomenon since childhood and find its existence to be scientifically plausible. I am also quite comfortable in the wilderness, having spent much of my life in the outdoors from Alaska to Costa Rica professionally, academically and recreationally, but I never honestly expected to experience anything first-hand with such a creature. So, being educated and reasonable, I declined to respond. As we continued, we began hearing other noises. First we heard ""whacking"" sounds of wood against wood (more probably stick against tree). Perceiving this ""hooting"" and ""whacking"" as a less-than-friendly display, we became a little nervous and contemplated leaving; but curiousity and the dread of packing up, moving to an unplanned location and reconstructing in the dark, while already soaked; compelled us to stay. So, we continued constructing the tent between periodic scans of the area. The ""whacking"" continued and we noticed it would come from different locations in short sequence (too short for one individual to move from point A to point B). Again my friend asked: ""What do you think that is?"" I gave the guarded response: ""I'll tell you what, I've spent alot of time in the woods and observed alot  of animals, but I've never heard anything like this."" I assume he read through the evasion to the meaning of my response, given the ubiquitous usage of the word ""Bigfoot"" , and images thereof, in the surrounding communities and some casual conversation we had had on the subject during our drive. Shortly before turning in for the evening, I heard a short series of what sounded like heavy footsteps on the rocky terrain of the hillside, in the rhythm of a two-legged walk. Turn in we did, however, with senses piqued and dog tucked securely within the tent. We slept intermittently and restlessly hearing sounds throughout the night.  Most frequently we heard the ""whacking""; most regularly a rather hollow-sounding report originating from a point some distance to our Northeast and up the hill. We would, however, periodically hear closer and clearer ""whacks"" from varying locacations to our general Southeast; once hearing a disturbingly close and firm ""whack"" from our South/Southwest. I awoke, once, at approximately 3:00am and heard distinct, single-note ""whistles"" from the general direction of the distant, hollow ""whacking"" which were, again, decidedly unbirdlike, yet not quite human. Soon thereafter we were all startled upright by a ""crack"" followed by loud rockslide, terminating distressingly close to our location. My friend informed me he had heard two other, smaller slides earlier that night. After all was quiet for some time (except the perpetual ""whacking"") we eventually slumbered down again, awakening to sunlight and (finally) quiet surroundings. In the daylight we observed that the hillside was quite steep, rocky and slightly parabolic in shape, and the rock slide ended up in our South adjacent campsite, leading us to conclude that: 1. Inspection of the hillside would be dangerous and turn up little or nothing in the way of footprints; 2. Sounds could have originated from well up the hill and carried down the ""amphitheater"" hillside; 3. If it were people playing a prank, they must be extremely dedicated to risk their lives negotiating that hill in the dark and rain and to wait in the woods any given night for the off-chance campers might come by in November; 4. Though rock slides may naturally occur there on occasion, they certainly must not occur on the order of three a night or someone would implement measures to ensure no one camp in that location; 5. Maybe that ""skunky"" smell we had encountered just previously was not a skunk. At any rate we drove on the next morning to the Willow Creek Ranger's Office (making no mention of the events) to inquire as to open trails. We were instructed that much of the back country road system (and corresponding trails) was closed due to the Port-Orford Cedar Root disease, but that we could drive into the Horse Linto Creek area and hike along the closed roads. We took that advice and spent the next five nights uneventfully. We decided to return to Aikens Creek for the final night (Saturday, Nevember 22)  to take advantage of the open, flat space to dry wet equipment and see if we could observe anything further. We picked an open site midway between the foot of the hill and the highway, layed out equipment for drying, then decided to day-hike somewhere nearby. We drove up Bluff Creek Road to its closure at the road junction to Fish Lake then hiked 1.6 miles down that road.  I payed close attention to the steep clay roadsides, and once noticed what could have been a partial footprint of a large, humanlike foot from the heel (about 4"" in width) to a point about 6"" forward (and perceivably midway along the length of the foot. I found, however, no other footprints or enough context to draw any real conclusion about the impression. That night, back at the campground, we kept a large campfire and kept some down and dead cedar boughs nearby to throw in for quick brightness if needed. At one point , my dog suddenly barked and charged towards the trees at the edge of the campground just  below the freeway. I halted him and went to investigate, but found nothing unusual. Though better prepared we neither saw nor heard anything further that night. We returned home however with a new awareness.","Aikens Creek campground, immediately West of Bluff Creek on HWY 96",Humboldt County,California,Fall,Report 7452: Campers Hear Unusual Evening Sounds,41.23528,-123.6581,11/16/2003,7452,Class B,9r24d4duvm,51.63,49.66,47.69,45.18,0.84,1,0.74,0.0178,1,rain,1017.86,Light rain throughout the day.,2,6.86,150,0.28
"I have spent a lot of time in the woods. I was a climber for ten years and I have heard it all out there. This was different. I was with my sons. We all wanted to camp in a bigfoot area, so we we went to a campground near Bluff Creek.  We were all in the tent and in our bags, the camp had settled down and all of a sudden there was a whoop! They were loud as if behind us, in succession whoop whoop bah-whoop!! And it seemed that there was more than one, I estimate three, one to the left of us, one behind us, and one off in front at a distance.  Also, something either took a large step or jumped off something, and it was big. The one behind us would call first and the one off in the distance would call back. The one to the left would whoop once, but the one behind would whoop three times and the others once or twice. At the start of the whoops would be almost a pucker or click sound. I figure the one behind us was the lead because he would call out and they would answer. After about ten minutes the lead creature started to move off with the one to the left towards the other. I wanted to look out the tent but my youngest was with me who is 6 and was real scared, because the calls were so loud. I stayed with him and did not get to look till it was over. I found no evidence in the morning, but earlier that day I noticed there were markings on a tree that was not made by a bear, almost as if the bark had been picked off.

"NOTE: Please see the following included sections for elaboration of details.  Two of us were driving home from a day of skiing at Mammoth Mountain California. The road was a two lane highway (opposite directions) with a soft dirt shoulder. We were in an open convertible (because the skis did not fit otherwise). The moon was full and the lighting was un-obscured and visibility was (near daylight) excellent. In the distance (well beyond the reach of the High beamed head lights) two of us could see a very large and (completely out of place) thing running ahead of our approaching car.

"This was a vocalization by an unknown animal. The following event happend on the second night of a two night deer-hunting trip. The woods were alive with animals and fresh sign -- scat (bear and deer); prints (bear, deer and cat). We were both in sleeping bags and in a small two-man tent since 2000 (mainly because the temperature dropped so quickly and it was the warmest place to be). Sometime after 0000 and before 0400, my hunting partner and I were woken out of a sound sleep by these sounds. The clear, cold air in the mountains makes it difficult to estimate the distance of the vocalizer (s). I would guesstimate .5 to one mile -- far enough away that neither of us felt ""threatned"" enough to get situp with our pistols. Number of vocalizations: 5; within seconds/minutes of each other. First vocalization: from the northeast. Second vocaliztion: 5 seconds or less after the first vocalization; from the northeast. Third vocalization: 10 seconds or less; farther away (fainter) than the first two vocalizations; from the east/northeast. Forth vocalization: 5 seconds or less; farther away (fainter) than the first two vocalizations; from the east/northeast. Fifth vocalization: 1-3 minutes after the forth vocalization; closer (slightly louder) than first two vocalizations; from the south. Description of sound: Unknown. Myself, hunting partner and other hunters spoken to the following morning are undecided as to what made the sound. Possibly a cat, bear cub (why would it be out at night?)...sound variously described as resembling a seal, though higher pitched and faster; somewhere between a coughing growl and a scream. We joked that it could have been bigfoot, except we were too far south. After checking your site, I find I am in error! After the trip, and having just watched the special on Discovery Channel (?) I checked out your site and some of the recorded vocalizations -- they were enough to put the hair up on the back of my neck; very close to what we heard.

"I am a long term seasonal with the US Forest Service.  I do know the different tracks the wildlife leaves behind. What I and a co-worker saw was not a typical wildlife track. On this day, we decided to go to the Piute Mountain to cover illegal OHV trails.  As the day was going we covered 5 illegal trails around the Landers meadow area then decided to head for the Weldon and Woolstaff meadow area.  As we were heading towards the Weldon Meadow area a rancher stopped us to ask if we saw some of his cattle.  Are reply was ""No, if we see them we'll let you know.""  Never found them.  At Weldon meadow we stopped for lunch and this was are next area to work.  During lunch, the co-worker went to do a little exploring.  After about 10 minutes the co-worker yelled to me to come and see and ID some wildlife tracks.  These were not wildlife tracks.  We saw what looked something like a human foot track but, it was way to big with a slight distortion in the toes.  The tracks measured about 16 inches long and 7 inches wide.  The tracks looked like the ones I saw last year at the Six Rivers National Forest.  I snapped a picture of the track and looked to see wher the tracks were going.  The tracks followed the barbed wire fence.  The meadow area is used for cattle grazing.  The co-worker asked me what it meant.  I said, ""It's possible that Bigfoot was looking for food or was heading for the spring at the end of the fence.""  We then proceeded to do are work so that we could finish this area and head for the other area.  We finished and headed towards the Woolstaff Meadow Area.  Once down there we proceeded to do are job.  While working on the project, I spotted the same tracks that we saw earlier.  The tracks cut across the trail and headed towards some rock outcroppings.  This was enough to spook my co-worker and so we left the area.  Back at the office the co-worker told what we saw and was laughed at.  I didn't tell them that I snapped pictures of the tracks.  I too would have been laugh at.","From Lake Isabella - head east on hwy 178 to Kelso Valley Rd.  On Kelso Valley Rd - travel 17 miles to a dirt on the right hand side.

"I lived in the High Desert of California in Ridgecrest, CA in Kern County from 1980 to 1985. I did a lot of hiking in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. I never saw or heard anything unusual during that time. MY Mom, Sister (& Family), and Brother and his Family still live there. My 19 year old son and I were visiting various family members from Sept 17 through Sept 27 2007 in Ridgecrest, CA. My sister took me and my son up to the Siebert family gold mine, cabin, and mining equipment on the 24th of September. We had spent about an hour at this location and we were preparing to leave. My sister was in the Port-a-Potty and my son and I heard this high pitch scream like a woman hollering, and it sounded just like the ones we heard on your sight. Just like the sound that was reported in the BFRO Report # 9426 (Class B), which is only 7 miles from that site. We yelled back thinking it was a woman in trouble and there was no reply. I asked my sister if she heard it she said no.

She has lived and in this area since 1980. I asked her Husband who’s an avid hunter, horseback trail rider and hiker in these mountains and he said that he knew of no animal that made a high pitch scream in this area.

"My name is J. M., and my friend's name is R.S., and we were hiking about a mile above Sand Canyon, near Tehachapi, California, he lost his prescription sunglasses, and we split up to search for them. As I was hiking, I saw a very strange track. It looked human, but it was larger than any human foot print. Also, unless a human was walking a mile from the road barefoot through rough terrain, so it couldn't have been human. I met up with R.S., and on the way back I showed him the print. He is an Army veteran from Iraq and an avid hunter, and he was simply shocked by that footprint. He said to me, ""J. look, you can even see the toe prints!

"I cannot say this is a Bigfoot event.  I did not SEE what was happening - I only HEARD it. I was outside early one morning in June, 2005 - around 0600 - when I heard perhaps three dogs start to bark.  They were perhaps two or three blocks away (the forest is very near there) when they began. This went on for a couple of minutes until the dogs began to bark louder and more fiercely.  Then I heard a very loud howl, which certainly didn't sound like any dog I've ever heard.  It reminded me of a Gibbon call in the zoo; more ape-like than dog. The dogs continued to bray, and the howler got louder and tended to drown them out. It did not sound like a fight but rather, a bunch of animals having a verbal argument over their respective territories. This went on for several minutes - perhaps 5 - until the animals grew tired of their noisy discourse.  It presently stopped. I did not see any of my neighbors out and about so am not sure who if anyone else heard this. I am not a believer in Bigfoot per se, but since being up here and that episode, I have to wonder.","I live near Susanville California in a small community just off Eagle Lake Road (which branches off Highway 36 about four miles west of Susanville proper) surrounded by the Lassen National Forest.

"This is what you might call a stretch, but here goes anyway: About 15 years ago, when I was 17-18, I went on a hike with a friend trying to reach Smith Mountain, on the edge of the San Gabriel Wilderness. We made it up to the saddle where the trail goes downhill into the wilderness, and where we were supposed to leave the trail and go south up the mountain, and decided we didn't feel like going any further. I'm assuming we rested for awhile, and I remember just talking and hanging out. As we were getting up and ready to go, we heard a strange noise coming from the bushes nearby. We stopped talking and listened, and it was a very low sort of growl/snuffling sound. My first thought was that it was probably a bear, but that ultimately I had no idea what it was, and it sounded like it was growling at us. The bushes along the trail there were very high, such that we couldn't see through them. It scared the hell out of us and so we quickly hoofed it back down the trail. I'm not sure if we ever spoke about it again, except to maybe say I wonder what it was, that was scary, etc. But afterwards I actually looked through field guides trying to figure out what was making the noise. I knew that bears, mountain lions & bobcats are relatively prevalent in that part of the San Gabriel Mountains, so assumed it was probably one of those. But, after browsing around your site, and seeing several sightings near the SG Wilderness listed, I'm beginning to wonder. In retrospect (although it could be my overactive imagination), it sounded a bit apelike. VERY low-pitched, so that we almost couldn't hear it at all, and had to ask each other, ""Do you hear that?"" Take it as you must; I just think it's interesting in the context of the other sightings in the area. I only wish I could remember any more details, and that we had had the cajones to hang around longer and check it out further.","It was on the trail leading into the San Gabriel Wilderness from the east, at the saddle on the wilderness border.

"Me and a friend at the time were hiking in the Angeles National forest. My friend was just out of boot camp USMC and we started hiking as often as time would allow. We were hiking down a small stream bed that went down hill. The stream was all dried up and it was mostly rock hopping until we got to the bottom of the hill, at one point there is a small section off to the side that is just dirt and makes for a much easier walk down to the bottom. When we got to the bottom we hiked a bit more but as the sun started to go down, we headed back up the same hill/creek bed. I followed my own boot tracks back up as I was tired of rock hopping, while going up, the smell in the air was horrible, like rotten eggs or portable toilet, I then noticed on one of my tracks laid a dead ground squirrel, right over my boot track. I pointed this out to my friend and as soon as I did this, a loud banging over a short hill side was heard, it was coming from about 35-50 yards away from us. It sounded as if it was a large log being hit against a tree. I looked at where the noise was coming from and noticed the tops of the trees were swaying back and forth; all this time of the swaying of the trees the pounding on them could be heard. Then the pounding stopped and a loud groan/scream was heard from the same area as the pounding of the trees. I have never heard anything like it. I’ve heard Mt Lion, Black bear, this was nothing like that, and was very-very loud, to the point is was damn scary. My friend asked if we should look over the small hillside to see what was making the noise. I said no way, and he agreed. When we started walking away the banging and screaming would stop, but as soon as we stopped it would proceed with the groan and screaming and the trees would start swaying. We finally got out of there and my friend did not want to talk about what had happened.","It was up the Angeles Crest Hwy, Not sure on exact mileage, but I would say about 10-15 miles maybe a little bit further up Angeles Crest Hwy, this road can be reached off the 210 Freeway up foothill blvd.",Los Angeles County,California,Spring,Report 14953: Possible intimidation in the late afternoon reported by hikers in the Big Tujunga Canyon area.,34.25,-118.225,7/30/2006,14953,Class B,9q5fvep0ty,73.51,66.265,59.02,62.77,0.91,0.81,0.17,0,0,,1013.11,Mostly cloudy throughout the day.,6,9.88,223,3.55
"First, as a matter of background, I want to tell a little about myself. It will help explain the delay in ever having reposted this incident. The sighting occurred about three months prior to my entering the United States Army. I served for three years as a Paratrooper with a Top Secret Clearance. After my time in the service, I became a Los Angeles Police officer. I did that for thirteen years and am now a Federal Agent, working for an O.I.G. out of Washington DC. With that background, you can probably understand my reluctance to discuss this sighting with too many people. It really boils down to a potential career killer. That being said… the incident DID occur and I remember it vividly. Many many years after the event, I reconnected with my friend (the witness) and asked him to tell ME the story as he recalled it. I wanted to check my memory and see if his matched mine. It did…. To a T! Only a few months ago, I spoke with my brother in law, a witness after the fact. I asked him if he remembered the event…. He did. It should be known that he is not the kind of person that would ""buy into"" such a story, had he not been semi involved. Anyway, this is what happened: My friend Craig and I were both 17 years old and waiting to leave for Army Basic Training. He was due to leave in June and I would go in August of 1980. We were staying with my Sister and Brother in Law at the time. They lived in a cabin in Green Valley California. Craig and I enjoyed our last months as civilians in that area, and used it to train for the difficult training ahead of us. We ran every day along the mountain roads and hiked the hills, trying to get into prime shape. In May, we decided to test ourselves and camp out for a full seven days. We knew the perfect place for this would be what we called ""The old campground"" because of its isolated surroundings and terrain that would be perfect for climbing and hiking. So, we packed up a weeks worth of supplies and, though my sister Cindy and her husband Tom offered to drive us, we decided to act like soldiers and walk to the location. We did this with full packs. My sister and Tom advised us that they would check on us at least every other day and that they would bring us food and lemonade and such. Tom also, offered to provide us with two weapons to be used for protection against any strangers that may try to harm us. After all… this was before cell phones and we would be on our own big-time. There was also a heavy rattlesnake threat in that area, so we happily took him up on the offer. Tom met us at an area near the mine shafts later that day and gave us an M-1 rifle and a 12 gauge shotgun, with ammo for both. The dirt trail that leads off of the main highway goes very far back into the mountains. In fact, were you to traverse it to its end, you would end up on top of what is known as Grass Mountain. Craig and I decided to get about three miles in and away from the highway, which was about a mile past what once was an old 1920s campground, and live deep in the bush like soldiers would. We found a great spot, next to a clear running creek and set up our tent in the clearing that was there. This clearing was completely surrounded by thick woods. Then…… night fell. As we lay in our tent talking by the light of flashlights, we both heard the very loud snap of deadfall in the woods behind the tent. We sat up, frozen and listening. We heard what sounded like a very large and heavy person, slowly walking around our site, making no effort to conceal his presence, judging from the loud sound of breaking sticks and brush. We were both scared believing that someone was out there. We exited the tent, Craig with a shotgun and me with the M-1. I started yelling very loud. ""Hey! We know you are there. We have guns and will shoot!"" Again, we heard the sound of someone walking slowly but methodically around from our left to right. We shinned our lights in the direction but could not see anything but the trees and brush. We talked amongst ourselves, wondering if it could be a bear or something, but we decided that it was a person and not an animal. After much yelling and warning that we would shoot, I decided to fire a few rounds in the direction of the noise (how crazy that sounds now) and I did just that. I fired about three rounds into the trees and the sound was unbelievable. The weapon blasted and the sound echoed into the night, roaring into the canyons and fading off into the night air. We stood in silence. To our utter disbelief and eventual horror whatever it was, began to move again, still left to right, in a circle around us. What we both thought and discussed later, was that NO animal would have stuck around after the horrific noise of the M-1. Most normal people would not have stuck around either! Whoever or whatever was out there not only stuck around, but appeared, from the casual sound of the slow walking, to be less than concerned about our weapons. We made a decision to vacate the area post haste! Grabbing our coats, we climbed the embankment up to the dirt road, and carrying our weapons, we ran the entire way, about three miles more or less, back to the main highway, San Francisquito Canyon Rd. We spent a very long night, curled up in a concrete drainage ditch, waiting for the sun to rise. Every hour or so, a lone truck would come by and the sound of that brought us comfort. Again, it was a long night! The next day, we hiked back to the site, expecting to find our tent and all of our supplies missing. To our surprise, everything was as we had left it. Nothing was out of place. We gathered our things, and hiked back to the open area of the old campground. We decided not to sleep in the tent because it limited our vision, and instead, laid our sleeping bags out in an open area, above the creek. After a day of climbing cliffs and cooking and such, night fell again. That night, just as the sun set and darkness was beginning to fall, Craig and I were walking in the direction of the main road. We were looking for rattle snakes, because we had shot one earlier on the dirt road in the same area. As we walked side by side with me on the left, both holding weapons, we saw it. Standing just on the dirt road, facing us was a Bigfoot. There can be NO DOUBT at all about what it was. We could see it very clearly. He was about eight or nine feet tall and stood with his left shoulder even with the edge of the trail. He was covered with dark hair and had long arms. We did NOT smell anything unusual, as I have since read about other sightings. The strange thing about him was the absolute indifference in his expression. He did not look threatening. He did not look scared. He just stood there looking at us….almost bored. I instinctively brought my right hand up against Craig's chest and we both stopped dead in our tracks. We never took our eyes off of the Bigfoot as we spoke. I said, ""Do you see that? Are we seeing this?"" Craig said, “What do we do”? “What should we do?"" We both started to walk backwards as we spoke, very slowly and involuntarily. The Bigfoot just looked at us for a few moments. Then, and I will NEVER forget the detail of this…… he just slowly and very casually turned to his left, and began to walk into the forest. When he did that, Craig and I stopped and started talking over each other. ""Do we shoot it? Should we shoot it? What do we do? Do you want to follow it?"" As we talked, we heard a sound that we both immediately recognized from the prior night, the sound of the Bigfoot slowly walking deeper into the woods, breaking deadfall, twigs and branches as he went. We never did fire a shot or follow him. We stayed up late and slept in shifts at the campground and did not hear from the Bigfoot again. The next day, Tom came up with food and supplies. We ran to him and told him the details of what had happened. It was very clear by his expression that he did not believe us. We took him to the exact spot where we saw the Bigfoot and we discovered a trail of giant footprints leading from the trail into the woods. Tom smiled and told us that we did a good job making them. We were so frustrated and begged Tom to follow the tracks with us. We all followed them and they went into and across the creek. On the other side, we found a large red ant hill with a footprint right on top of it. I asked Tom, how could we have done that? He just shook his head and smiled. We followed the tracks to a point where two large hills formed a valley that sloped upwards into the mountain area. The ground turned rocky and the prints stopped. That is what happened. I have lived with this memory for many years. I am now Forty Five years old and am less concerned about what people think of me in terms of this incident. It is a fact and because of it, I know for sure that Bigfoot lives or at least once lived in the area of Green Valley California.","Going North from Santa Clarita, get onto the San Francisquito Canyon Rd. for approximately fifteen miles, then take the dirt road on the left which would be the South Portal Canyon Rd. which is just a couple miles before you get to the Green Valley turn off.

"I left my parents house on my way back to NAS Lemoore, Ca.

"On a day after the snow had fallen, we went hunting up in the Lake Hughes area in California. There were 4 of us hunting that day; my dad, and myself and 2 good buddies. Well, the deer hunting was not that good that day so one of my buddies said to us, my wife's uncle is gone from his cabin and won't be back any time soon, so why don't we visit his land and all and just hang out and all and have some lunch. Well, he lives by Lake Hughes's road and close to where we were. We went over there and unlocked the gate as he had a key. We went in there and we had brought some apples for our lunch and all. We seen he had hogs and started feeding them these apples. After about 1/2 hour of doing this, we heard the horses behind the house or cabin, running around and making all kinds of noise. We could not see what was going on as; the house was in the way. But, man were they going nuts!!!  So, we all said to each other, let's get over there and see what's up. We did and could not see anything but the horses still going nuts and running in circles. We then looked over this fence and threw a gate and seen these huge foot print's and smelled something like a dog that's been wet and rotten egg's mixed. Well, the gate was locked and he went inside the cabin or house and got a key for the gate. We went over to the prints, and I'm 6-5 at that time, and weighed 275 lbs. I have a shoe size of 15 4-E. These tracks were much bigger than my shoe and they were made, with some of them in the snow.  I stepped next to them and could not press down and going that deep! I could go maybe 3/4 - 1 inch down. These prints were 4 inches deep!! They were also, 2 to3 inches longer than my foot and much wider. Then I tried to step that far with my step, and no way could I. Then we followed the tracks until they came to this really steep hill. There this thing went up this hill on 2 legs and stepped high enough that, even my good buddy who was a body builder and in great shape, could not climb. I could not even lift my leg that far, and I was 16 years old and pretty limber. No man could lift there leg that high or step that far! No man!!!  Nowhere did we see bear tracks and even if we did, they don't walk that far on 2 legs. Whatever this was, it walked along this fence and turned and went back into the woods, and then up this very steep hill. It must have looked at the horses and maybe seen us feeding the hogs. I never seen it, but we got scared and left that ranch. I have told this story to a few people, and they look at me like, it could be, but you can tell, they don't think this is real.  But, when you see things like this, you just know something is out there. Nobody could change my mind on this one as, I know what I seen and it was not set up as, nobody knew we were going to his ranch, and the next ranch over, nobody was home there either. So, the only thing that could be is, this was real and not faked. Nowhere did we see any human foot prints by any of these tracks or up that steep hill. I know something is going on up there. N.

"Last night, Jan.16,2005, I took my dog outside for a little walk. We live on 2 acres in Redwood Valley, CA.  It was dark and about 6:00 with a mod. overcast sky, the moon peeking through the clouds. We have a small dog that will usually bark in response to any other dog barking in our area.  Houses are well-spaced on our rolling hillside that's covered with a mix of oak and pines. From Hwy. 101 looking west, you see very few houses on our hillside. Anyway, as I was walking I could hear this very unusual ""animal"" sound unlike any I've heard before. It was NOT a dog howling and I'm not even sure how to describe it. We have coyotes and mountain lions and the sound would not fit the description of their cries or calls either. It had a yelling/howl quality that lasted about 5 seconds , would break off and then resume about 15 seconds later. I went in the house to get my husband so that he could hear the sound. My dog was not barking which is really unusual because he's inclinded to bark at dogs or other unfamiliar sounds.  None of the dogs on our hillside were barking either which seemed odd to me. I was kind of scared .  My husband came out and listened. His initial response was, ""Anyway, it's on the other side of that hill."" I said, ""It's not a dog, and our dog is not barking at it.""  He agreed it was strange but wasn't concerned. Soon thereafter, a dog could be heard barking and our dog started in with his typical barking response. The unusual sound stopped and I didn't hear it again. This is not the first time we've heard  unusual sounds that we can't identify. We woke up one night hearing whooping sounds outside the house that I can't connect with any animal I'm familiar with. My daughter has also heard whooping sounds on the same hillside where we heard the unusual sounds last night. My teenage son heard whooping sounds last summer in the manzanita to the north of our house. We had an odd experience last summer. My college aged son and his friends were imitating ""Big Foot"" sounds that they'd heard on the internet . It was about 11:00 at night when they were fooling around , loudly imitating the sounds.  About 1:00 AM, that same night, we were watching a video and we heard a scratching at the window. We all thought my son was outside trying to scare everyone. All of a sudden , water was splashing all over the side of the house. A water sprinkler pipe outside the window had been snapped off, and water was geysering out of the pipe. My son walked out of the bathroom and it turned out he'd been in the house all along. No one had been outside and we still wonder how the pipe was snapped off. Whatever had been scratching at the window had apparently broken the pipe.  We all wondered if it was a response to the Big Foot calls that the guys had been making. Anyway, here's a synopsis of a few incidents.

"Re: Our Bigfoot encounter in California My wife and I have had two incidents over the year, including vocalization and wood knocking. We are San Francisco City people, artist; not hunters. We are not used to the outdoors or accustom to the forest and nature and the shock of fresh clean air. The first encounter was on Tuesday evening, 8/16/05 at 5:17pm on highway 128 in the Redwood forest. We were on a vacation, driving west on 128 and heading towards Fort Bragg, CA. Once we entered the state park, we stopped and parked to smell the fresh air. I marked the time, because I was shooting with my digital camera. We walked into the forest, on a trail, and were having a great time, enjoying our time alone. There was little traffic or noise from the road. The forest was quiet and powerful. We have lived in the center of San Francisco for 15 years, and were stunned and amazed to experience the silence and peace of the Redwoods. As we got deeper into the woods, about 20 minutes, I started to get uneasy; feeling like someone was watching us. The digital photos my wife took of me show my concern, the longer we stayed. Then we heard it.  It was a growl-grunting. Just above the hearing of my ears. I would described it as “infra-sound”- a deep sound that was low in pitch, deep, almost inaudible. My body felt it more than my ears. It threw me in a panic. The fear in me rose fast. I looked at my wife and she was feeling the panic. We both looked around. We could not tell the direction. We could not see anything in the thick woods around us. It could have been a bear or a wolf. But my instincts said no. I did not know what it was. But, the ""vibe"" message was becoming clear- GO AWAY NOW! Predators do not warn-they ambush-right? My wife looked at me and said “Did you hear that?” I said “Yes”. She said, “Let’s get back to the car”. I said “Good idea!”  It was a weird feeling. We were stunned and mystified as we ran back to the car. We drove away nervous and excited about what happened. On our way to Fort Bragg, CA, we were talking about the experience. Was it a bigfoot? Did we have a Bigfoot encounter? We felt something special had just happened. We had to learn more about bigfoots. Over the year, I became obsessed with bigfoots. I read as mush as I could about the Sasquatch, Yeren, Almasty, and Yeti as my time permit. My wife became obsessed also. Together we decided to go back to those redwoods and try to make contact with the forest giants. We made it back to highway 128 on Monday 9/4/06. Something told me to pull over at a different spot. As soon as I got out, I had the DV video camera running. On the camera my wife tells me to make my “Whoop-Whoop” Bigfoot call, into the redwood forest. As soon as I did, the camera records wood knocking and tree breaking. Soon the smell of a dead animal/skunk filled the air. The sounds and smells go on for about three minutes,  then stops. I could tell he moved away after my calls to him, inviting him to be photographed. We left the redwood forest, excited about our contact. My wife wants to see a bigfoot. I do not want to see him.  I hear that many people die or have very bad luck after seeing a Bigfoot. Remember Dr. Morbius from the movie Forbidden Planet? Maybe Bigfoot is the ID, coagulated from the quantum soup of our collective unconscious mind.

"Id like to do it this way, still not sure exactly what happened. Im with a paranormal invest group, earlier this monthwe went to Round Valley (Covelo) In calif. One of the investigations was a night time walk up a hill at a rancher's property in Covelo; earlier in the week, from what I remember hearing, was a Bigfoot had been interacting twice with his horses, which he chased off, so we hit that spot. Except me, I stayed in the car with a video game and a flashlight onhand. Maybe 10-15 mins after everyone else took off up the hill, I noticed a movement by the rear passenger window at the driver's side of the car, something a gold-tan color was standing by the back window. Turned off the interior light in the car and sat in the dark a little while, maybe 4-5 mins, then turned it back on. Whatever it was came back to the window again; this time I heard what I guess has to be described as 'patting/palming' the door of the car. I about lost it then, ( I dont scare, so this is really strange), and turned off the light, didnt turn it back on till everyone else came back down the hill. Just before people returned, I saw something run past the car really fast, up toward the front of the car line ( we had 4 cars there, I was in the last one). No one else saw the running whatever, they checked the door but didnt see any muddy handprints or anything on it. Im still frazzled, been dealing with all types of wild animals  since I was a kid ( aunt worked witha  zoo and Ive done wildlife rehab since I was a kid). Heard from someone in town there that BF's have a way of sort of mentally 'fear-paralyzing' animals; this sort of explains why I tried to turn myself into a tall thin stick when I was sitting there.

"We (my husband, my son, and myself) were in Mono County this past weekend, Sunday August 21st, 2005, for a day hike to Roosevelt Lake and its twin.  We arrived at the lakes at appx. 11 a.m. and fished until 2:30 p.m., at which time we decided to head back down the trail for home.  There were quite a few hikers in the area over the course of the day, appx. 13 hikers and a pack train consisting of 4 riders and 8 horses and a dog. Some coming in, some going out.  Anyway, we headed down the trail following the pack train.  We stopped on the way down to read the sign about the wagons that tried to use that trail way back in the day. I heard a noise like some one else coming down the trail behind us and told my family let's get going.  The trail was pretty dry and dusty and my husband kept insisting that we give the hikers ahead of us some time so we could avoid walking in their dust. The next section of trail was slightly up hill so after cresting the top and going a short distance down the other side we stopped for a water break.  We heard what we thought was a shout, my son shouted back and something answered, but the echo was pretty bad, so we couldn't make out what was being said.  We continued on down the trail and had just approached the south end of Leavitt Meadows, when my husband says ""What is that?""  Both my son and I stopped and looked across the river toward the meadow.  From the beginning it was a strange sight, because this large black thing appeared to be floating across the meadow.  At first I thought it was a backpacker perhaps riding a bike, because it was moving so quickly across the meadow. It was moving quickly and smoothly.  It didn't make sense.  If it was a back packer, to be moving that fast, he would have to be running and running with a back pack is anything but smooth; if he was riding a bike, then why couldn't I see the bike and its arms and legs were in line with its body, not bent at an angle like it was sitting on something.  Also the color, I couldn't figure out why a backpacker would be wearing black, black cap, black backpack, black pants, black coat.  It was at least 80-85 degrees.  We stood and watched silently for a time, perhaps 10-15 seconds.  The speed and smoothness with which it traveled was mesmerising.  Then my husband and son took off running further up the trail to another vantage point; they continued to watch it silently, then just shortly after I caught up to them, my son yelled, and the thing stopped and turned toward us.  It didn't turn as a human would turn, even one wearing a backpack.  Then it began moving across the meadow again.  Not faster or slower, just the same floating type pace. We were on the trail above the meadow, looking down and appx. 500-800 yards a way from the object.  My husband believes the thing was following the pack trail. We left the trail and went down to the meadow.  We stayed on the trail side of the river.  The thing was on the opposite side of the river.  By this time it was gone or hidden from us.  The best way to describe it is like this.  The thing had a head that sat directly on its shoulders.  It did not appear to have a neck.  That is why we at first thought it was a backpacker.  It went head, broad shoulders or backpack, no neck, large body.  We could not discern its legs or arms due mostly to the angle at which it was leaving us. The grass in the Meadow obscured some of the legs. We have spent many hours in the woods, my husband was raised in Plumas county, neither he nor I have ever ever seen anything like this.  It could not have been a bear, they can't walk that far on 2 legs, nor that smoothly or quickly.",The trail goes into the Hoover Wilderness beginning at Leavitt Meadows Camp Ground.

"I used to live in Bishop, CA on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada mountains.  I have spent lots of time camping, hiking, fishing, and skiing in the Sierra backcountry.  I am familiar with many kinds of animal sounds and signs in the mountains. Last weekend, we were camping at the Sawmill Walk-in Campground on the east side of Yosemite National Park.  After sunset as dusk was deepening, we were sitting around our camp table talking.  From the direction of the forests that line the canyon floor towards Mt. Conness in the west, a series of whoop-howls rang out from the distance and rolled down the canyon.  My sister was talking and immediately stopped, turned around, and said, ""What is that?!""  The calls continued for a few moments and then ceased.  They sounded most similar to the Snohomish and Puyallup calls on the BFRO website.  When the calls started, all other normal background wildlife noise stopped and didn't resume until several seconds after the calls ceased.  There were no answers to the original call, nor did it repeat. That area of Yosemite is relatively deserted, and the Sawmill Walk-in Campground only has a few sites that are scattered widely.  The trail that runs through the campground eventually leads to the top of Mt. Conness and branches into the back country.

"Two years ago, I went with my Uncle to stay at a cabin in Mammoth Lakes to hike, fish, and just enjoy the nature.  We had a cabin right on the border of Lake Mary and he had brought his two sheep dogs with him to the cabin. Every night he and I would take turns taking the dogs out for a walk. We would bring a flash light with us each time we went out to walk the dogs. One night when I was walking the dogs, one of them started growling and I listened closely and could hear the rustling of fallen leaves and the breaking of small branches. I shined my light right at where I heard the sounds. Now both of the dogs were growling and pulling at the leash trying to get at whatever was in the forest. I looked around closely with the flashlight and then I saw something. A huge figure about 200 feet away from me was watching me and the dogs. It was kind of swaying between the trees and just staring right at me and the dogs. It looked like a very tall ape, but it looked more built like a human. I was scared stiff and I must have stood there for a minute or two holding the dogs back and staring at the creature when it turned around and started walking away.

"When I was very young I saw a pair of Bigfoot tracks with my father. I’m guessing I was about 9 years old. I’m now 22. My father and I used to go rabbit hunting all the time. We always went to the same place and always saw dozens and dozens of rabbits. We would get up very early in the morning, about 1AM, so that we could get out to our spot about an hour before dawn. So it was a few hours outside of Bishop, CA. We would make sure to get there early so that we could sit in the car and wait for dawn to come. Just as the sun would start to rise and there was enough light to see we would normally see tons of rabbits running about, but that day was different. There was not a single rabbit in sight. That had never happened before. We stayed in the truck and waited until the sun was fully up before we decided to get out and take a stroll around to see if there was anything to see. Just before we left the truck my dad asked me if I wanted to bring the camera and I told him ""Na, we aren’t going to see anything out here."" Ha-ha! Boy was I mistaken. We took off from the truck and went into the wilderness. There was nothing to see at all. No animals anywhere. We were walking along and suddenly we came upon the giant footprints in the sand. There were two sets of prints, one right next to the other. They were barefoot and looked just like human feet. Right away we knew what they were. It’s a natural thing that goes through your mind. When you see them you say yourself, ""Those are bigfoot tracks."" The first sets of tracks were HUGE, and thee times as big as my fathers feet, and he is about 6' 3"" with a good sized foot. (He is very thin though). The second set of footprints was the same size as mine. Right next to its parents tracks. The tracks dug deep into the ground and my father and I talked about that. We tried to stomp on the ground to see if we make an indention as deep as theirs but we couldn’t, even with our shoes on. We followed the tracks and we came to a barbwire fence. On the other side was a paved road. On the other side of the road was a hill that went up and overlooked a valley. I was too young to notice anything about how the tracks crossed the fence and got to the road or if there was a piece of fur on the barbs, so I’m sorry that I couldn’t tell you anymore about that. On the other side of the road there were no tracks and we couldn’t find any more around. My father decided that we needed the camera, so I stayed at the fence while he went back the way we came to get back to the truck. It seemed like it took forever for him to return and being a little kid I was getting a little scared. But, he finally came back and told me that he could not find the truck! So when we were done looking around we took the road that we had found to see where it would lead us. It took us to a small town that we had passed to get to our spot. So we knew where we were form there and were able to finally get back to our truck and once we were there we decided we had gotten enough walking done for the day so we headed home.","After some questioning, it was determined that these two hunters went north from Bishop, Ca. on Hwy. 6, and then went a short ways west on Hwy. 120.

"On May 18, 1991, while on vacation in the Mammoth Lakes area in Northern California, my family took a short day hike to Mono Lake to do some sightseeing. It was overcast and very cold with a strong wind blowing. There was still snow on the surrounding peaks. Mono Lake is at the base of the Sierra Nevada mountains. I do not recall the location at which we parked the car to begin our hike, but I do remember that ours was the only car in the parking area and that the spot was quite desolate. It was a cold Saturday morning and the area was deserted. At 9:17AM I began shooting VHS video footage of our trek, and after a short period of time we finally decided to leave because of the wind and cold.

The tape went into our family home video collection and for 17 years, from 1991 to 2008, it has been watched countless times by family and friends. So much so that my kids have the dialog on much of the tape collection memorized. On April 19, 2008 my daughter (6 years old in the video and now 22) was watching the tape in the downstairs family room when she suddenly screamed out and began yelling for me to come downstairs. I thought something bad had happened and after racing down the staircase, found my daughter and my ex sitting in front of the television telling me to watch a segment from the tape. What I saw when we played it back made the hair stand up on the back of my neck. And it was something none of us had ever noticed in almost 17 years of watching this tape, In the final few seconds of the Mono Lake segment just before I turned the camera off I caught something very large and black moving between two rock formations a short distance from where we had been hiking. It was completely black with no differentiation in color or texture and walked upright like a human but with a gate more like a primate. At first I thought it was a bear, but after going over the video many times and finally digitizing and sharpening it I am now unsure what to think. From examination of the footage of my family whose distance from the camera was comparable to that of the creature it is easy to see the distinct details and variation in clothing, hair, face and hands. In contrast, the creature caught on tape exhibits none of those distinctions.The shape of the body does not resemble a human. The head is too large and the arms are too long. And although it does resemble a bear at one particular angle in the clip, the stance and gate don't add up. It is an intriguing mystery. That we were able to go for 17 years without noticing this event on the tape seems unbelievable, but in retrospect it actually makes some sense. The segment lasts for only a couple of seconds and the focus is on the lake and mountains which is what I must have been filming at the time. I didn't see it when I shot the tape and it has since gone unnoticed because one must really be looking for it to see it. I am not a person who is prone to believing in conspiracy theories, alien abductions and bizarre events such as a purported Bigfoot sighting. I've seen various footage and photographs of Bigfoot/Sasquatch sightings over the years and have always been extremely skeptical of their authenticity. As an engineer who now teaches high school physics, I am highly educated and very level headed. If I see something I don't understand my natural reaction is to analyze it rationally using the scientific method. I do not jump to conclusions based on faulty hypotheses. So in this case, I will suspend judgment pursuant to further investigation. But having shown this video to family and friends whose opinions I trust, the overall reaction seems to be a unanimous ""Bigfoot!!"" Wishful thinking? Maybe. Maybe not. Either way it is very intriguing and definitely warrants further investigation. Your opinion and assistance in this matter would be appreciated.","Maybe 20 yards from the waters edge on a section of beach at Mono Lake.

"I have spoken verbally with an investigator about this incident, but never filled out a report. The more I think about it, the more relevant it seems. So this is my report: I had been camping on family property for two days waiting for others to arrive. This property once had a cabin on it that was destroyed in the late sixties by an avalanche, but the concrete slab is still there, and we park RV's on it. I had been sitting in a folding chair reading for a couple of hours when I heard a very large branch snap. It was loud like a gunshot, or at least seemed that way with all of the quiet. Immediately after the snap there was a commotion as some of my nearby items (gas cans and trailer dolly) fell from their spot behind an old wooden shed about 35 feet from me, and something very large moved through the trees for about 30 feet and stopped. As soon as the branch snapped, I shot out of my chair and then heard the rest of the commotion. It really scared me, and I looked around for the dogs. They were cowering at the door to the trailer, which is strange because they usually go after anything out there. I wanted in the trailer just as bad as they did. As I approached the door, I got the feeling that the animal in question was a short distance away watching. It was very unnerving.

"A week ago my family and I went on a vacation to the Double Eagle Resort and Spa in June Lake, California. We stayed at one of the furthest cabins at the resort, which backed up to a forest at the bottom of granite rock formations. These rock formations separated the Inyo National Forest from the town of June Lake. The first night we stayed at the resort, June 30, 2010, my brother, my father and I were watching TV in the front of the cabin and at around 11:30pm we went out on our deck to look out at the amazing view we had. Within five minutes the silence was broken when we heard a howl in the distance, which sounded like it was coming from the granite formations, which over looked the resort. All of us froze. The sound scared us because we had never heard a sound like that before. The vocalization lasted under a minute. We waited for another 10-15 minutes out on the deck to see if whatever made the howl would howl again. But it did not howl again so we went back inside and I took a shower. While I was showering my brother and father continued to watch TV, but this time they opened up all the windows in the cabin to see if they could hear the howling again. When I got out of the shower ten minutes later, my brother and father told me they heard the same sound again when I was in the shower and this time my mother who was in bed with her window open heard the howling too. This time there were three howls, which were all shorter than the first howl we heard on the deck and there was only about 20 seconds in between each howl. My family and I stayed there another night but did not hear any more howls.","The location of the howl was near the Double Eagle Resort and Spa located South of Lee Vining and Mono Lake off HWY 158, which is a two-lane road, which makes a C connecting back to HWY 395.",Mono County,California,Summer,Report 27966: Possible howl heard by three family members while on vacation at June Lake,37.79337,-119.118,7/31/2010,27966,Class B,9qer12hfm6,74.32,62.37,50.42,30.65,0.3,0,0.68,0,0,,,Clear throughout the day.,11,10,222,7.05

"After reading report 7804, I suspect that my son may have seen a bigfoot in early December, 2003.  His mother and I are divorced and where she lives outside of Grass Valley. There are houses out there that are close together but also big areas of wooded lots. He told me that he thought he had seen Bigfoot while walking home from his bus stop. Normally, my ex-wife picks my son up at the bus stop, but he had asked to walk home this day.  It is about 1/2 mile from the bus stop to his house.  As he was cutting across the woods, about 100 feet from the bus stop and 20 feet off the pavement, he jumped up onto a stump.  Below him he saw a black figure, taller than 5'10"" (my height).  It was about 15 feet from him and breathing very heavily.  It had its arms to its side and was rocking slowly, side to side.  My son was afraid, but didn't want to scream in case the animal reacted badly to the noise.  He just slowly backed up the hill, keeping his eyes on the creature and when he got to the pavement, ran home.  He said the creature turned its head to follow his movements, but otherwise didn't move. When my son got home, he immediately told his mother and then later, me.

"First of all I am a 55-year-old male former Marine, fireman and state police officer just recently retired. I have been all over the world in the military and an avid camper. I have often heard of big foot and thought possible not likely. Although I didn’t believe they existed I kept an open mind. I have seen many things in my time that were hard to explain but were not as vivid as the following. I was driving on Rte 80 e/b in California at 14:30 hrs. on 08/16/04 and I had just passed the truck inspection station and State Work yard which was west of the Donner Pass. As I was crossing over a bridge which crossed over a ravine with a river through it I looked down into the ravine and saw what looked like (about 7 to 8 foot tall) broad shouldered possibly male, all black from head to toe form stepping from the tree line on the west bank approx. 300 to 400 yards south of the bridge. I immediately pulled over to the side of the roadway on the bridge and slowed so that I could see it better (traffic was extremely light -two other cars.) When I looked down I was able to see that the form had no identifiable clothing or demarcation lines or hat. It then was walking in a lanky movement with arms swinging as it crossed the stream/river. I then noticed a slightly smaller (6-7 foot tall)(pos male due to no obvious breasts or femine movements) come out from the tree line behind the other male trailing him by about 30 feet and slightly south by about ten feet. They both continued across the stream and into the tree line on the east side and disappeared. I sat there trying to evaluate what I had seen. I then concluded that these forms were not any animals I've ever seen. They were one solid color from head to toe with no discernable clothing. They had nothing in their hands or on their feet. I could not come up with any possible concept as too why these individuals would be out there. The temperature was extremely warm so the clothing if it was clothing was way too much. Their faces and hands were the same color as the body. I then proceeded e/b with no further sighting.","As you pass through on the east bound side on Hwy 80, just before Donner Pass, there is a truck inspection station.

"Me and my fishing buddy went camping at French Meadows reservoir to get in the last days of the season.  In the campground we were alone and everything was shut down, nighttime temps were 32 and 29 the second night.  We were in the last campground on a dirt road a mile east of the lake.  Very few hunters were in the area because it’s a game refuge and no other fishermen were in the area.  We got in camp around 9pm because the fishing was great and it took time to clean our fish.  As soon as we got there i gave out my whoop whoop whoop whoop, hoping to hear a return call.  This went on every hour and my buddy all the while half cracking up looking at me like I’m nuts.

I was shocked to get my first return call ever, it sounded to be a good 300 to 500 yards out and with a two D-cell flashlight, Ii was not going to investigate.  The direction the sound came from there were no roads or camps.  I knocked on my buddy’s car and got him up hoping he had heard it but all he said he heard was me.  From now on I will take a recorder.  I’ve been hunting fishing and hiking all my life and that was the only time I heard this sound. It was not a coyote, a cat or an owl [I know them well].  In my heart I believe it was either a person or a bigfoot.

"ok. this story is happening right now...went out with my kids, my sister & my girlfriend to the park in auburn ca. after that we went driving through a very rich housing development to see the address signs that i made for the houses at my work, we were close to a lake called lake arthur. it was about 7pm? sunday, today, sept 30? we walked along the trail there about 30 ft. came upon a large tree branch or small tree, about 13 ft long, 12"" in diameter. i picked it up on end and tumbled it down the small hill side/river bank, then again to get it in the water...very heavy. no apparent reason for it to be lying across the path at all. continued on deeper down the path about 1/4 mile or more to a dead end. by this time it was very minimal light, started walking back our dog took a crap in the path ahead, and you could see it darker on the yellowish oak leave covered dirt path, and we could see to avoid it, when we got to the area that i moved the tree, my son said to me, watch out there is something dark and smooshy there, i stopped and looked at it, he said to me, it looks big though. it was a freshly wet imprint of a foot shape, and there were more leading from the lake up into the woods up a steep hillside. there was one great print, and a half a dozen others about 3'- 4' stride. and one like a slip or slide on the hillside. i said it looks like a small bigfoot print, because of the heel, and ball of the foot and a strange toe pattern. like pinky toe on the side of the foot. my kids got scared after that....i walked up the hillside where the prints lead about 20' into the woods, very minimal light, i saw 2 large black shapes laying down, one very large, and one about my girlfriends size about 5 feet away from the big one. both lying down.----girlfriend is about 5'1""heard noises, and backed off. as we walked the path the next 10-15 ft, we heard bipedal walking 2-3 steps, stopped when we stopped, and then continue. took my kids home, got my pistol, for protection only of course, and went back with my girlfriend. we took photos of the prints and measured them approx. 8"" long. not very big. indentation, approx. 1"" in pretty hard dry dirt. prints were wett and the rest of the ground was dry every where. my thought-maybe a curious smaller one came down and checked out the tree i pushed into the water and left the wet prints on the way back up? i have more on this, i hate typing, you can tell with my shortness in descriptions, i went back and heard an actual deep breath/slight grunt and more bipedal steps, scared me, even though i know they dont tend to harm people, i totally believe in bigfoot, and i have never seen or heard anything before. i am extremely skeptical, and i study  these kind of things. give me an email address so i can send the photos. i am going back in the morning. i am very excited about this. i have the photos, and 5 witnesses. my son found the tracks....they were almost crying to go home after the walking we heard. it was very heavy...not a bear, atleast the tracks were not. small human foot print with pinky toe on the side of the foot. not like your typical bigfoot print.this is within miles of sugarpine area, and foresthill. i have seen alot of stories in these areas on your site.","take I-80 east bound toward reno from auburn, take meadow vista exit, cross over overpass, take frontage road left which i believe is still drycreek, you will hit a lake on your left. lake arthur",Placer County,California,Fall,Report 21808: Possible sighting by family walking their dog near Auburn,38.95285,-121.0479,9/30/2007,21808,Class B,9qcvt7psg3,74.74,64.085,53.43,36.21,0.44,0.01,0.65,0,0,,1015.49,Mostly cloudy overnight.,6,10,179,1.47
"It happened a couple nights ago. I was watching a movie in my room when I heard a noise outside. This was about 1 in the morning PST. It sounded like a long blowing horn, so I turned my TV on mute thinking it was a siren. I knew it was not a siren when I heard it again, and I knew it was coming from something alive. I went outside and the noise was so disturbing that I actually felt scared of it. It was more like this cry but in a howl, like it was hurt and moaned in pain by an injury. I have a few dogs, and each of them were very disturbed by it too. They refused to come near the front or back doors. It was like they didn't want to come outside. I assumed it must be a bear or a mountain lion, but the one thing that confused me was I don't think animals like them sound like that. The day after this happened, my friend came to pick me up around 8 at night. We enjoy going to casinos, and there is one about 35 miles from where I live. The sun had just set, and we drove maybe no more than 4 miles down the road when I heard the noise again. I rolled the window down more, and my friend heard it too. It was close to where we were, so we slowed down to get a better hear. The noise stopped, so we started driving again. About no more than ten seconds later we saw what looked like a 10 foot man, covered in hair. This is not a joke, and when the headlights shined on his eyes they glowed. Human eyes don't do that! He was pretty far from our vehicle, and no I didn't see his face. His hair was black maybe dark brown, and yes his eyes glowed by light! The first thing we both thought was bigfoot, but neither of us agreed. I did a little look-up on my computer and found information on bigfoot. The howling, and the sight of that animal could not have been a human, and if it were then he had some massive eyes with big contacts to make them glow like that. I am pretty sure the car behind us saw it too, because they slowed down and stayed behind for about a minute after we drove away.

"My father and I were elk hunting in October 2005 in the White River National Forest near the Flat Tops Wilderness.  This area is in Rio Blanco county outside of Buford, CO.

The slide is an open area that extends up the side of a mountain about 1/2 mile.  It is steep and as a result has a central corridor that is devoid of trees.  It is surrounded on both sides by dense forest growth.  It is rocky and very rugged. I met him one morning at about 1030 am to help out.  When I arrived he told me he had heard a series of very loud knocks sometime before I arrived.  He said it was up the slide toward the rim and the flat tops area on the top of the mountain.  He said that they were very loud and sounded like a man hammering on a tree with a hammer.  He said that the knocks were so unusual, he thought I was up above him messing around with him.  I told him that I had not been, and then jokingly commented that bigfoots are   said to make sounds like that. Anyway, we started working on the elk and I was there about a 1/2 hour when we heard the knocks again.  This time, they were to our left (south), at the same elevation on the moutain we were on.  They came from dense growth and seemed to be no further than 100 yards away.  There were 8-10 knocks, very rythmic, and quite loud.

I turned and looked back and noticed a large black bump sitting where I waited just moments ago. Then it stood up and walked right at me. Then I said “Hey you” in a loud voice. Then it turned and it walked or ran very fast directly to the north into the timber. No noise, but it looked to be like a bear due to the heavy coat. But when do bears walk like humans? And it had a large swinging motion on the torso area. Very weird. So I'm afraid really to tell this story because I do not want my friends or family to know about this. It's such a weird thing to tell people.",The sighting location was about 7 miles east of Aspen at the top of the  Hunter Creek drainage of the Hunter-Fryingpan Wilderness Area.,Pitkin County,Colorado,Fall,"Report 7036: Elk hunter trailed by large biped in twilight, finds tracks the next day",39.45824,-106.625,9/17/2003,7036,Class A,9xh0mxnhcm,59.46,38.61,17.76,28.12,0.53,0.48,0.72,0,0,,1003.01,Mostly cloudy starting in the afternoon.,8,10,257,4.42
"My girlfriend (now wife) and I were snowshoing in the mountains above fish creek falls outside of steamboat springs, CO in the winter.  We were off trail and decided to attempt to shortcut down the mountain to get back to the trail head.  We miscalculated and found ourselves in a very steep ravine just above fish creek and we were trying to find a way back up the steep incline as it was nearly humanly impossible to scale the side of the canyon.  Ahead in the snow we saw a set of tracks heading straight up the side of the ravine.  Initially we though it must be an elk or deer, but looking at the spacing of the tracks they appeared to be created by a bi-pedal creature with a gate much larger than I could span (I am a little over 6 foot tall)  The tracks appeared to have the basic shape of a human foot and toe impressions could be faintly seen in a couple of the tracks.  The tracks were postholed - 16 - 24 inches deep and most impressive was how this creature powered it's way through this deep snow up a slope that was over a 45 degree angle.  A deer or elk would have left long dragging skids through snow this deep, but there was no dragging, just deep, large, single steps that would look just like a humans gait, except maybe a foot more between each step.  We pondered it at length and I have a couple of digital photos, although honestly not much showed up with the whiteout action of the snow.  I spend a lot of time outdoors and I have seen countless elk, deer, and bear tracks.  This was none of thsoe for certain.  A friend of mine who is active in your organization told me I should post this despite the lack of credible proof, so here it is! I can provide the actual month and date when I dig up the digital photos...",Take the fish creek falls main trail across the bridge (passing the falls) and continue up the trail about 1/2 mile until you are past the switchbacks and the trail straightens heading WSW.

Decend towards the creek until your about 150 feet above the water and then follow the creek back towards the bridge and falls (heading approx wnw) and you will pass over roughly the same area we did.

"We were hunting third split rifle in section 26 of Flat tops in 2005. I had not seen many Elk in area this year. I hunted an area I had seen Elk before in the early morning by myself and saw nothing. My brother Greg got up late and went to same area. He said in open grassy area on side of hill was a large group of Elk in plain sight. Greg took a shot at about 200 yards from a fence. He shot at a large bull in group. He thought he was successful, but nothing dropped. He walked accross Derby creek down a big canyon chasing them, but to no avail. He came back and got me from camp excitedly after looking all afternoon. I have confidence in my brother shooting, so I said lets go back and look some more. After, we got back, we went to side of the open hill and found two separate blood trails. Not one, but two, which is strange. You could smell what I thought was Elk heavy still in area, so I thought. I followed blood trail down the ravine towards Derby creek. As I got about 1/3 down on Elk run at a very steep angle the huge bull Elk from the group came running crazed up the trail and was on me in no time. It about run me over and I jumped to get out of the way and I fell down. Then after I got my wits back from nearly being gored. A bout 30 seconds later we heard the loudest angry howl or growl I have ever heard come from the hill below me from the heavy woods. It made my hair stand on end. Everyone heard it, it was a 100 times louder than an Elk bugle and sounded like an angry animal or human of some kind as it echoed through the ravine. It really was something. In fact, it was the most awesome sound I have ever heard in my life. It spooked the horses from our other hunters and the guides horses as well as the hunters. In my mind, we may ruined a another hunters hunt. This is why the second blood trail, and the foul smell and the angry yell. I will never forget that day and my brother and I speak of it often.",The area is the Derby Creek drainage system near Stump park.,Routt County,Colorado,Fall,Report 23305: Hunter hears loud vocalization and is nearly trampled by a spooked Elk north of Burns,39.879,-106.6735,11/7/2005,23305,Class B,9xh4uef8p2,58.17,49.495,40.82,20.61,0.41,0.15,0.2,0,0,,,Mostly cloudy in the evening.,3,9.82,226,1.81
In about late June of 2008 I was hiking the crater Lake trail outside of Durango Colorado with 3 of my children. They had run a little ways ahead of me and I was just admiring the view when off in the tree line about half way up the trail I noticed a large hairy figure approx. 7 to 9 feet tall walking just behind the tree line at about 50 to 100 yards. It was walking upright and took long strides. I only saw it for a minute maybe and didnt say anything to the kids so not to alarm them. I never really told too many people about this but after watching a bigfoot special on tv about a year later I realized I wasnt the only one to ever see something like that in this area.,Up 550 past Durango in the San Juan mountains.

"My husband and I were camping in the Eagle Nest Wilderness CO early June 2013.  While hiking on the trail we had encountered a larger then normal amount of snow due to the late snow storms.  We were a few miles up the trail from Surprise Lake when we heard a low growl.  We thought this must be a mountain lion and due to the snow and inability to travel quickly we double backed to surprise lake and set up camp for the night.  While sitting at the lakeside I saw a large, brownish red animal across the lake.  The animal was large and appeared to be walking upright.  My rational mind said its just a deer or another large animal that lives in the wilderness and disregarded what I thought I saw.  Later that evening around dusk my husband and I were sitting in the tent when we heard what sounded like a knock against a tree.  We looked out the tent door and didn't see anything.  Again I assumed this must have been a woodpecker, another animal, or a hiker.  We continued talking and heard the knock again, it was a three knock pattern, along with something that sounded like a rock against a tree.  We got out of the tent and looked around.  I told my husband it sounded like a rock thrown against a tree and said let me show you what it sounds like.  I picked up a hard sound rock and threw it against the tree.  Immediately a similar sound came back.  I assumed it was an echo and I did it again.  Again a similar sound came back.  My husband then asked if I saw something moving up the hillside and explained where he saw movement.  A large, brownish red animal was peeking out from behind the tree.  The animal was swaying back and forth from behind the tree.  The animal appeared to be squatted down swaying/peeking out from behind the tree.  It had a large head with a large brow line, large shoulder, and nose.  The nose and upper lip appeared to be a lighter color than rest of the animal seen.  We took our sport camera and tried to take pictures of the animal but it was about 40 feet up a hillside.  (We have a blurry picture but it appears to have a large animal head in the picture.)    As we watched the animal sway back and forth we heard a large knock behind us to the left, towards the lake, then heard a knock up towards the animal we saw then back behind us.  The feeling was very odd and made us feel very uncomfortable.  My husband wanted to hike out but due to the late evening I suggested we stay and hike out first thing in the morning.  We carry a large knife, bear spray, and a gun with us so I felt somewhat safe.  It was a very restless night and first daylight we packed our bags and left.  After hiking out and getting in the car to drive off we discussed what we witnessed and both could not explain what we saw.  This has taught me not to throw rocks against trees! I would be willing to send the pictures we took.  Two are extremely blurry due to my hand shaking, my husband took two other pictures, one you can see the head if you zoom up and the other it appears it moved.",Campsite at Surprise Lake in the Eagle Nest Wilderness.

"My family (5) and I go on vacation every year. One year we decided to go to Colorado on a camping trip. We also would always our dog and this year my brother took his rat.  After a long trip across Kansas, we finally crossed the border to Colorado. We headed to Colorado Springs. We were going to stay at a camping trip, but as usual we found a place to set up camp away from any sites or towns. It was pretty secluded where we were. Our camp site was surrounded by woods except to the east there was a long field. Now it was the very first night and we had two tents. In one tent was my Parents and my sister. In the other tent was my brother his pet rat and I. We ate a good meal of hot dogs and s'mores. A sitting around the fire for a little while, we went to bed. It was a very clear night and I remember how bright the moon and stars were. I really ever heard of ""bigfoot"" or paid to much attention to it before. It seemed like I hadn't had much sleep before I awoke to find my brother's rat digging around in the bag at the top of the little pup tent(my brother let the rat run around in the tent). Its rustling is what I think woke me up. So I got up to take him out, but I froze as did my blood. I was suddenly wide awake. I just stared because to the left of me I saw the silouette of a tall two legged creature through the door( we had zipped up the screen and left the cover off ).  I was and still am sure that it was not a bear or any other animal, and I am especially sure it was no human. Its arms were shorter than its legs and it was covered with hair. I got the feeling it was alarmed because right when stopped a jerked its head and walked speadlily away. My eyes were glued to it and I watched its every move. It walked away towards the field, turned around, and I lost sight of it. I can still remember thinking about the way it moved. It definatly was not normal. It bent at the knee and when it turned, it seemed like its whole upper body moved around. Of course the next day when I told my family no one believed me, but I know and I have known that it is a fact that sasquatch is real and is a living breathing animal. I also believe that it is not a threat. I definatly encourage people who are trying to bring sasquatch into reality for others for the right reasons.

We heard something we can only speculate about but I can still remember clearly the sound.  It was the middle of the night and I was awoken by the sound that started low and went to a high pitch scream.  I'm sure my hair was standing on end.  Then I heard it run off.  It was right outside our tent.  We were camping at Lost Lakes by Blues Lakes.  Our altimeter read about 8400 feet. There were no other people in the camping area around the lake and it was very quiet. It was a week night and the nearest campers were down at the Upper Blue Lake Campgrounds.  My husband is a very sound sleeper and did not hear it and said I must have dreamt it. He almost had me convinced when the next morning our friends who were camping with us and had their tent a little ways away asked if we heard the strange scream. He said he got up and went out side the tent to see what it was an was and saw nothing but there was a terrible smell outside.  We still cannot give credit to another animal and our family are hunters and have spent many hours in the wilderness around the country.,Hwy 88 to Blue Lakes Rd. You go back to the PGE Campgrounds.

"My family and I were driving in a remote area of the Sierra Nevada mountains last Tuesday looking for a place to ride our sleds. The sites we were seeking were few and far between as the area had no significant snowfall in over 3 weeks.  We were above the 7,000’ altitude marker along Hwy 4 and it was a mild, sunny day.  The ground was covered in snow. We had exited Hwy. 4 at the snow-play area west of Bear Valley and proceeded along the road to Spicer Reservoir despite patches of shallow snow still in the road. We were driving slowly along the road and, approximately 1 mile from Hwy 4, we noticed deep impressions in the snow along the right hand shoulder.  We stopped to examine these “prints”, although I am hesitant to use this term as no details - like toes - were present.  These had obviously been here quite some time and had melted and frozen several times. They were large and deep, measuring 16"" long.  What impressed me the most was that these prints were in a straight line. I recalled this was an attribute of bigfoot track trails, having read this in Dr. John Bindernagel’s book and in other texts.  I retrieved my tape measure and discovered the distance of the step (that is, the distance between one impression to the next) was 60” in the first measurement and no less than 56” in the others. I am 6’ tall and was not able to match this step, especially not in shin-deep snow. I decided to submit a report of a possible track trail along with this photograph.",1 mile south of Hwy 4 along Spicer Reservoir Road.,Alpine County,California,Fall,Report 9898: Family finds trackway near Bear Valley,38.45799,-120.0491,11/23/2004,9898,Class B,9qfdu1nfj0,42.89,33.165,23.44,24.13,0.78,0,0.41,0,0,,1019.69,Clear throughout the day.,3,9.83,271,0.17
"My wife and I were hiking for the afternoon in the Mokelumne Wilderness in Alpine County, California.  Our destination was Granite Lake, two miles from the outlet of Upper Blue Lake.  We reached our destination, had lunch and were returning, following the trail back the way we had come.  When we reached a pond, about 1/3rd of the way back, I expressed a desire to my wife to take a hike southward across the same elevation level as the pond, to another lake called Evergreen Lake. There is no trail or pathway to this lake, and I thought it would take about 20 minutes to reach it.  My wife declined to accompany me, so I told her I would return in a while.  I began walking, trying to keep my position along the same contour line as the pond.  The forest was fairly dense, and generally well covered with pine needle duff, generally underlayed with decomposed granite.  After a short walk, I realized that very likely few people had ever gone where I was headed, as there were no signs of previous travel, and the going was sometimes difficult.  I tried to stay on the contour, but kept slipping lower down I went.  After a while - more than 20 minutes, I realized that I wasn't going to find the lake, so I started back.  As I walked back I took a different route, trying to regain the elevation I had lost on the trip out.  I came across a section of forest floor where there was mostly decomposed granite, and as I followed this - which was a bit easier to travel on - I come across two sets of footprints.  The first set looked almost human, except they were wider and longer than usual.  Noticeable were the toes, and a definite arch.  The second set of prints were from a larger creature, and left a deeper impression, especially in the heal area.  This track was wider still than the first, and looked similar to typical casts of Bigfoot prints. There was no noticeable arch, and the toes were not especially evident. Both set of tracks were superimposed at points, indicating that one creature was directly following the other, stepping in the same spots at times.  The tracks quickly were lost in the pine needles further ahead. It had snowed two days before, and the ground was damp, but most of the snow had melted.  These tracks were fresh, likely less than 24 hours old.","There are no other directions to give, aside from what was given inn the narrative.",Alpine County,California,Fall,Report 12818: Hiker leaves main trail and finds two sets of footprints,38.6167,-119.9501,10/15/2005,12818,Class B,9qfewmzn84,41.9,37.165,32.43,27.95,0.68,0.23,0.44,0.0017,0.5,rain,1010.17,Partly cloudy overnight.,5,10,243,0.76
"Three of us went on a deer hunt that morning. We had a hunter at the top of the hill and he went up there in the dark before sunrise. At dawn my uncle and I went up the hill together parting ways half way up. There were two other hunters not in our party camped by us about 200 yards away at the base of the mountain. We did not know them or their plans. Anyway halfway up the mountain my uncle went to the right (SE) and I went left (NW). The southside of the mountain (which I was on) was open with sage brush and scattered cypress trees. In the gulches of the face, were thick timber groves of mainly large pine trees, clustered, only to be seperated by the openess I just described.My plan was to stay in the tree groves working my way to the peak driving the deer to the top of the hill where the other hunter was positioned. I worked the grove until it ended forcing me to cross a clearing to the left to enter the grove located under the peak. When I got to the right vertical edge of the treeline to the grove, I found the first blind. It was made of a broken branch that was placed up side down and leaning against a tree. The branch was interwoven into the branches of the larger tree. At this time I had a feeling I was being watched and assumed it was the other two hunters that weren't in our party that were camped a couple hundred yards from us at the base of the mountain. I continued left into the grove and found a 25 foot tree placed upside down next to another tree well over 50 feet high. The base was about 18"" and had been snapped not sawed. Some branches had interwoven into this tree just like the little blind I first discovered on the groves edge. I'd guess the elevation was 8,500 feet, as the top of the hill was 10,000 and our camp was at the base of about 7,000. I now had an increasingly strong feeling of being watched again at this point. As I left the second blind/upsidown tree working my way up and to the left I saw the silhouette of a bipedal primate about 8 feet tall standing still looking at me. It was perpendicular to me, faced up hill in almost a runners stance, and looking over its right shoulder, at me, slightly with its wide muscular torso turned to me. It's brow was extremly pronounced, its forehead was small with the back of it's head slightly pointed. His head (assuming a male as it did not have breasts,) was proportionatly small in relation to it's body. It's arms were extremly long, hairy, lean yet muscular, It's hands had very long palms and long fingers that curled back with a thumb that curled forward forming a backward capital ""C"" type shape. It then sprinted up the hill and vanished behind the trees faster than a deer bolts into a dead run from a standstill. It was on the left edge of the grove with a clearing behind it. This all happened in a second or two. I went to the place I saw it (60 yards) and found no footprints as the ground had at least a foot of pine needles that cushioned footprints and would spring back up when you walked. I used a tree that was close by gauge it's height. It was of dark color but not sure if dark brown or black as it was shady in the grove with sunlight behind it in the clearing. I was in a state of kind of shock and almost not believing what I saw but knowing I did and simply just amazed. Because of this when I got home, later that week I decided to consult a hypnotist. I had never seen one but figured since they help witnesses recall a crime and descriptions of accounts that happen quickly or under stress it would probably help me confirm what I saw. The hypnosis confirmed my sighting.

We stayed up late talking and what not and had gone to sleep about 1:00 AM.  Some time later, it was still dark out, I heard what sounded like a tree branch being wacked against the trunk of a tree, it had specific patterns and rhythms...but the interval of time between ""episodes"" was random...I heard similar noises from another spot in the area. I would estimate that these noises were about 300-400 yards away, maybe more.  My friends who heard it, who don't believe in anything they don't see, said it was a woodpecker.

"It was dusk my friend, his girlfriend and I were relaxing and swimming at a launch ramp off of Vinton Gulch Road near Oroville CA. When we got there we heard faint sounds like there were two, what we thought at the time, mountain lions calling each other off in the distant. My friend fished while I explored and his girlfriend swam. When all the other anglers that we fishing too me and my friend started making very loud sounds just to hear the echos off the surrounding canyons of Lake Oroville. Then I remembered hearing on one of the sound recordings off of this website and how there was sort of a whistle at the end of the recording from bigfoot so I started trying to imitate the whistle. Well after about five minutes I heard something ""running"" through the treeline of thick bushes above the lake line. It was coming towards us. I asked if anyone heard that and the said no. Right after I said that we heard the same sound earlier but within I'd say 200 ft from us at the bush line. We jumped in the car and turned around so we could make an escape in case anything attacked. My friend shined his light along the treeline and seen some eyes low at the tree line. So I stared whistling like I did before and it would make its sound softly. Well after three times I started mocking it and to our surprise and what made us leave was it whistled back to us. We took off. I tried finding sounds of mountain lions off of the internet that sounded the same but to no avail. Then I listened to monkey and bigfoot sounds and the only thing that came close was a Black Howler monkey. It had almost the same cooing sound.

"In the early morning hours of Tuesday, September 21, 2004, I drove towards Lake Oroville (approx. 25 miles from my house) to see if I could get any photographs of the lights of the Valley before sunrise. As I drove, I stopped a couple of times to take photos. It was extremely dark at the time, since the sun was not yet up and the area is against the mountain side to the North and North East sides. I turned my truck around stopped with my truck pointing toward the South West looking out over the Valley. My passenger side window was rolled all the way up but the driver side window was down. I had only been sitting there a couple of minutes when I heard a loud, very angry sounding ""roar"" coming very rapidly toward the back of my truck on the passenger side. I was quite startled (to say the least.. I think I might have screamed) and immediately looked back toward the direction of the sound but could not see anything but blackness. I then threw my truck into gear and took off rolling up my window as quickly as possible. It has been less then 48 hours since the incident happened and I am still very upset and more then a little traumatized. What frightened me the most was that the sound came from above the height of the cab of my truck and nowhere near the ground. It began behind me near the far edge of the road and lasted about three to four seconds then ended abruptly right at the back of my truck near the tail light on the passenger side. I could tell that whatever was making the sound was approaching very quickly. The sound was quite loud and very angry sounding and can only be described as a cross between a lion's roar and the sound a tire makes spinning in deep gravel. I have never heard anything that sounded like it before in my life. I do not know whether it was a bigfoot or not, but if it was a bear it had to be standing upright and at least 7 feet tall. I have since found out that the only bears in that area are small black bears that are not aggressive. I am a 44 year old mother of four and Grandmother of two.

"This happened yesterday: My wife and I were exploring some forest land northeast of West Point, Calaveras County, CA yesterday in our 4x4 and on foot, scouting for deer. Near dusk we set out a picnic next to a creek.  About 15 minutes after sunset a long howl came up the canyon from downstream.  It was loud enough to hear over the noise of the creek five feet away.  In between the howls there was deep toned ""jibberish-barking"" noise, almost like two deep voiced men talking at the same time.  It did not sound like humans, but we couldn't rule it out, until another howl answered from up on the ridge behind us.  Howls were exchanged from the creek valley to the ridge us and we were in between!  This ruled out humans making odd howls and ""jibberish"". The next thing we noticed is the cows that were grazing downstream all started heading upstream, away from the howl.  We could monitor their movements from their cow bells. We decided to pack up and high-tail it out of there, leaving right at dark.  Our departure route followed the creek downstream towards the source of the first howl.  As we neared where the howl came from, a buck bolted across the logging road in front of us, fleeing the creek bottom where the howl came from.  It was bolting up the hill before it noticed our vehicle. There are a few undeveloped creek access areas along the road and we looked at each one as we drove out, confirming no one was in there. A week earlier (last weekend), as we were leaving the area during a previous trip, my wife stopped her 4x4 because someone/something whistled from the woods.  The whistle was loud and nothing like any birds she'd ever heard.  The kids heard it, too.  (I was following her in a Jeep). Upon arriving home we listened to our ""Sierra Recordings"" CD's and the audio files on the BFRO site.  The howls were just like the Ohio recording and the distant ""ridgetop"" howls on the Sierra Recordings CD, and the whistling was just like the whistling on the Sierra Recording's CD. i also noticed lots of (dozens) broken trees and photographed some a few weeks ago.  I'm undecided as to the cause of their breakage. This area is very easily accessible, with logging roads through-out and only about 25-30 minutes out of West Point, CA.  Parts of the area are currently being logged, with miles of fresh, very fine dust perfect for finding prints.  Much of the area has been gated off for about 4 years and is now open due to the logging.",,Calaveras County,California,Summer,Report 9051: Family hears strange sounds near West Point at dusk,38.39917,-120.5264,7/24/2004,9051,Class B,9qf63q777k,94.92,79.665,64.41,44.09,0.29,,0.24,0,0,,,Clear throughout the day.,0,,255,0.39
"We were on our long vacation from Missouri, in Crescent City, California, staying at the KOA campground. This was our second night at this campground. We were camped at site 401, way back in the isolated section of the campground, far from anyone. I had just finished cooking our supper on the portable propane barbeque pit, which was located on the picnic table. We both went inside to eat. During the time I was cooking, I set up a camp fire, but didn't light it yet. After we finished eating, I started the campfire. After the fire was burning for about 15 minutes, I kicked it into the fire pit from the grate. At that time my wife got a very strong feeling that we were being watched from behind our camper. She said it seemed to move (the feeling) from behind the trailer, from one end to the other. There were trees, and dense foliage behind the trailer. I started to look around with a flash light to see what it was, and after not finding anything, I started the car and plugged in the 12v spot light. Looking around for about 5 minutes, I thought I saw something move in the distance, behind a tree. This was in the opposite area from the trailer, where no one was camped at all. We both were shaken up, and went inside the trailer for the night. After 10 minutes my wife heard 2 whoops, coming from the area that I thought I saw something move at. She was in bed lying next to the window. I didn't hear the sound. One more thing to add, is that the night before we heard dogs bark in the distance, this night it was all quiet no dogs at all. The closet camper was about 100 feet away towards the main office. There was no smell.","KOA campground located just off of Highway 101, 5 miles north of town.",Del Norte County,California,Fall,Report 24929: Husband and wife have a possible encounter in a KOA campground north of Crescent City,41.84998,-124.1417,1/28/2009,24929,Class B,9prwp4dcb9,52.14,47.97,43.8,40.58,0.78,0.53,0.08,0.0044,0.97,rain,1034.88,Overcast until afternoon.,2,6.64,343,1.37
"My husband and I were out quading up by Stumpy Meadows, that is up out of Georgetown, California.  I have lived in that area for roughly 40 years.  I have smelt some awful smells up there in the woods.  This day my husband and I rode down this one road and found out it didn't go anywhere, so we turned around and rode back out.  I went out ahead of him, I got far enough ahead that I couldn't see him when turned to look to see if he was following.  Anyway I stopped to wait for him. I thought I smelt someting dead, or  like something peed there more then once. It was a really strong smell.  My first thought was a bear.  While  I was sitting there looking around I got this wierd feeling that some one was watching me.  I was really getting scared, I always carry a 44 mag with me, so I figure I can be pretty much safe when I'm out there, but not this time.  I decided to go find my husband, as I started my quad up I heard a branch break.  I'm still thinking bear, but the smell was awful. I started to pull away and I looked down and there over the tracks we made earlier going down the road were the biggest footprints I have ever seen, then I knew that was no bear. I took off, I got about ten feet down the road when my husband pulled up.  He looked at me and said what's up?, you see a snake? So I showed him the tracks. Now my husband is the type of guy that would have to be knocked down by a bigfoot before he would believe.  Then still he would say it was something else. He said that because the road was so dusty that the prints  looked larger then they actually were.  He said he didn't smell anything but a faint smell of something dead.  I wanted to believed him.

"My wife, my two children, and I were driving on Hwy 50, west bound, leaving South Lake Tahoe at 9:55 PM.  We just passed the agriculture inspection station in the town of Meyers, CA, when both my wife and I saw simultaneously a large animal crossing the road about 100 yards in front of us.  I thought it was a bear but wasn't sure.  So I asked my wife.  Her response was most unusual. She said that she saw it walking on two legs and that it looked like a monkey, about 5 1/2 feet tall, with light brown fur.  She has better eye sight than me so I questioned her further.  ""What else did you notice,"" I asked, very curious.  She said that it had walked rather slowly, across the road, and that it was definately an animal, like a monkey, and walked like a monkey would walk. It disappeared into the trees, before we could get close enough for a better look.  I wanted to turn around and look some more but my wife didn't want to.  So we kept driving.  That's when I had a chance to question her more. My wife has had Laser surgery on her eyes, and I wear corrective lenses, which, most unfortunately I wasn't wearing at that moment.

"The weekend of August 16th my family and I went camping on Union Valley lake.  We had three tent sites about a 100 yards from the shore. On Saturday night my 2 year old son had trouble sleeping and kept me up.  I'm guessing it was around 1 or 2 am because of where the moon was.  About 200 yards to the south of our site in the woods this very loud and drawn out scream rang out.  I immediately stopped moving to try and see if I could hear any movement.  Then, from the west across the cove, the same sound responded.  The scream from the west continued at least 15 to 20 times.  There were other campsites and I remember seeing someones shadow as they walked to the bathroom.  The screams got louder and the individual hurried to the bathroom letting the door slam behind him.  The screams stopped and did not return.  My wife and two kids slept through the whole thing which surprised me considering how loud the scream was.  The next morning I asked my father-in-law and my wife's uncle, who were in the other sites, if they heard the screams. Both them and their wives heard them as well.  My father in-law, and my wife's uncle thought it might have been a group of coyotes, but we all agreed that we never heard anything like that before in our lives.  I can usually immitate any sound, but this scream was impossible for me to mimic. It was too loud for me to do.  I have listened to all of the audio that I could find and the recordings in Pallyup Washington are similar.","Campground on Union Valley Lake.

"I am posting this report after several months of trying to dismiss what I saw as a bear or other common animal. I have come to the conclusion that what I saw could only have been an unknown animal such as Sasquatch, as the behavior and curiosity of the animal does not match any animal I am aware of, yet is consistant with Sasquatch descriptions I have read on this and other web sites. I had heard recent reports of black bear sightings becoming more common in the Pollock Pines area and that the bears are extending their range from the Rubicon/Desolation Wilderness area south to Pollock Pines. Two black bears had recently been hit and killed on Highway 50 about 3 miles north of my encounter. All this talk of bears in our area is what led me to initially conclude that what I had seen was a bear. Approximately 5:30am sometime in early fall I was travelling northbound about 45mph on Sly Park road heading toward Highway 50. It was almost completely dark, there was some light starting to become visible, there where no other vehicles. I rounded a sharp corner to the left going downhill when my highbeams hit a large animal on the left side of the road, it was standing on two legs and was facing to the left. It appeared to be grabing at something in the trees in the front yard of a residence. As soon as my light hit the animal it quickly turned 180 degrees to it's right in a twisting motion going down on all fours and proceding to run on all fours to the other side of the road. The right side of the road had thick brush which at that time appeared to be about 3 feet tall. The right side of the road also opens into thick forest land. Upon first seeing the animal I slowed down to about 25mph to be sure this large ""bear"" got across the road without me hitting it. As I drove past the location where the animal had entered the brush I looked out the passenger window and to my surprise I saw it's face in the brush looking right into the window only a few feet away. I saw large reddish brown eyes, a large brown head and a dull black (not shiny) area that would have been the nose. I did not see ears and since it was looking straight on, I was unable to discern a flat or pronounced snout. In retrospect the face appeared to convey an emotional look of concern or panic. During the encounter I did not consider the animal to be anything other than a bear until several minutes later when I thought it was odd that the animal would cross the road to escape then stop just inside the brush to watch me pass. I would think a Bear would continue to run into the forest. Even with this curious behavior I continued to assume it had been a bear. I was shocked into reconsidering my expanation a few weeks later when road crews cleared the brush away revealing that the brush was growing on a drop off that was 5 feet lower than the road, making the brush 8 feet tall. This would rule out the animal being on all fours while looking into my passenger window. The animal had to have stood up again immidiately after entering the brush to reach the hight required to look into my window, that would place the animal at approximately 8 feet tall. Is it likely that all the behavior I have described can be attributed to a bear, not likely in my opinion.",,El Dorado County,California,Fall,Report 8595: Man has early morning sighting near Sly Park,38.72139,-120.5836,9/1/2003,8595,Class A,9qfk2118qq,92.39,77.83,63.27,41.29,0.3,,0.18,0,0,,,Clear throughout the day.,0,,106,0.08

"i went fishing with my girlfriend at stumpy meadows last winter. we been up their about five days out of the week. early in the morning we would arrive try to get the line in the water as much as possible. the rest of the time i would be looking for gold. we mostly stuck around the dam and the spillway. my gold fever and wanting to catch a trout with my fly poll got me to wonder down along the spill way. the hole time i couldn’t shake the bad filling i had well we had. it was the hair on the back of your neck being watched felling. i was at the vary bottom of the spillway in the middle of the stream standing on a rock fishing. my girlfriend was about twenty feet away panning. she said something lick lets get otta here something’s watching us. i told her i was catching it for awhile now to. so we climbed out of our little spot and onto a service rode that ran along the spillway. the hole time rubbernecking left right and especially behind us .some thing was putting the creep on us and was getting closer. we were walking as fast as you could without running or looking like you were scared sh**liss .but we both knew if one or the other broke and made for the car you might be last. so we held our ground and walked as casually as could be. i informed her that something was up on the other side of the spillway the hole time we were their watching us. and it was keeping pace with us as we made our way up the steep road. the thing behind us came from down bellow us on the same side of the stream and it was following just far enough not to be seen. we would stop it would stop. im a native american from auburn, and some of my relatives live in foresthill. and ive spent many nights with my cousins hunting though hills.

"I used to live in Camino, CA and would go up into Desolation Wilderness as often as I could. The trout fishing was really incredible and it left a wonderful lasting memory with me. Since moving from the area, I hadn't been there in several years. I talked to a friend of mine about going up and camp overnight and do some stream fishing. He agreed and also invited another friend along for the ride. We got up there in the early afternoon and hiked upstream from Wright's lake and then set up camp. A couple hours later a ranger came by and informed us that we hadn't actually made it into Desolation Wilderness yet, and that we needed to keep hiking for a while. We broke camp and then the 2 guys that were with me, suggested that we go into Placerville and get a room. Apparently they weren't up to camping and fishing after all. I said no thanks and that I wanted to come up here, to come up there and fish, not go party somewhere in town. So they left and I went up the hill farther. The ranger had suggested a great camping and fishing location, but because it was starting to get later in the afternoon, there was no way I would make it all the way before dark. He gave me a general location of where it could be found and what trails to take to get there, but when most of the area is large (football field size) sheets of granite, the trails are only marked with stacks of rocks and they are few and far between. I ended up getting lost a bit, but I could hear the stream flowing over rocks to the north of me. I walked in another half mile or so and located the stream. Below me about 35 feet down a granite cliff was a stream that did have a pool in it, right on the tree line. I thought what a beautiful place that would be to have a campsite and then picked my way down the steep cliff side. I set up my camp directly next to the pool and also with the treeline and some very dense woods about 6 feet away to the north. The pool was on the east side of me. I started fishing as soon as my tent was back up and had a gorgeous finish to a very nice day. Then after it got dark, I climbed into my sleeping bag looking to the east to the Crystal range, I think it is called, and watched as the glow of a full moon worked it's way up over the top of the granite mountains. Once it was over, my day was complete and I decided to go to sleep. That was at 10:30 pm. As I started to drift off to sleep, I heard what can only be described as a very low rumbling growl. When I go into a wilderness area, especially a place I know has bears really thick, I always carry a handgun with me. On this occassion it was a .45 compact. When I heard the growl, it really scared the crap out of me, because it was so close. I jumped up, with my .45 in hand and looked out the top of the screen mesh on the tent. I could see a dark mass about 4 1/2 feet tall, right at the edge of the tree line, 6 feet from my head. I yelled some really loud obscenities and started climbing out of my tent. Once I was clear of the door I brought up my pistol and fired into a dead tree a few feet away from what I thought was a big black bear. As soon as the pistol went off, it turned and ran back into the brush, but it didn't seem to go very far and that concerned me. Bears will usually run like heck and for a long time when they get a shot that close. This seemed to go maybe 50 feet or so into very thick brush. I could hear it thrashing about as it moved deeper into the trees, but then it just stopped. It all went quiet for about 15 minutes or so and then I tried going back to bed. Shortly after I started hearing what sounded like somewhat large rocks, hitting in the water, just above the pool I was camped beside. It would happen every couple of minutes or so. It was the sound of not only the splash, but also of the rock hitting other rocks, submerged in shin deep water. That ""cracking"" sound. This really concerned me, thinking the ""bear"" may be circling my campsite and trying to get at me from a different angle. I got out out my tent on several occasions, and was trying to see if I could make out any movement on the other side of the stream but nothing. I usually keep a small flashlight in my tackle box, which I had, but it was one of those small ""shake it"" and it charges up the cell and lights up for a few minutes. Not much of a flashlight really and worse yet, the handle is clear and so when I would turn it on, the handle would light up too, actually making it harder to see. I had a full moon though and the area is surrounded with stark white granite slabs, and so except in the darkest of the woods, I could see pretty clearly. This went on like this until 2:00 am. That was when I got another ""visit"". I didn't get to see it, this time, but I heard movement really close to my tent again, same place as the first time, and when I yelled at it, I got a return of something that sounded like an ""Ooof"" ""Ooof"", but really deep sounding. I jumped out of my tent again thinking I was going to see it again, but didnt. Still, I put another shot into the dead tree and off it went crashing through the brush again. Again it only went about 50 feet back. There was something odd about the way it sounded when it was running too. I didn't catch what it was though until I listened to the footsteps of a bipedal walking from your site here. It was only on two feet!! It concerned me enough to realize that it didn't sound like a 4 legged animal at the time, but I didn't know what was different until I heard your recordings. Anyway, still thinking I was dealing with a rogue bear, I started trying to figure out what it wanted with me. Was I camped on it's trail to the water? Was it used to finding food in tents? Desolation is a very high traffic place. This particular place was a ways off the trail and it didn't appear to have much in the way of hikers. Hikers usually leave some kind of sign, trash, fish hooks, something to say that they were here before, but this place was very clean. So I decide to take my sleeping bag out of the tent and move over to the middle of this big slab of granite that I am on. There is about a 4 foot tall ledge facing the woods where all the activity was going on. But now the treeline is 50 feet away and not 6. Figuring this would give me some advance warning if I got charged. The rocks kept flying, and I kept trying to sleep with one eye open, hoping the sun would come up soon, and checking my watch all night long. Then ""she"" showed up. It was 4:40 am and something woke me. I heard movement at the tree line again and I looked to where it all started from. I didn't see anything but then I looked at my tent. Standing right next to my tent was the ""creature?"". My tent is about 4 feet tall maybe a little less and what I saw was more than twice as tall. At first I couldn't see any features, just the outline. Then it took a couple of steps towards me. I almost pee'd my pants right there. I picked up the .45 and took a shot off to the left of it. It stopped and looked at me. Then it started walking towards me again. It was very fast. I don't mean that it was running, it's just that the steps were so big, the distance was closing very fast. Had it been a bear, I would have shot it immediately, but honestly, I don't think my .45 would have been able to stop it. One shot would definitely not killed it or stopped it in its tracks. Then as it was approaching me, I took another shot, but this one much closer. I could see it very clearly at this point and yes I did pee my pants. The second shot made her stop again, and then she took off running to the northwest through an area of mostly granite slab and dotted with scrub pine. This was the last time I saw her. She ran off out of sight at great speed. I stayed up the rest of the night until it got light enough for me to hike back towards Wrights Lake to the South West. For the remainder of the darkness I pretty much stayed put with the ledge to my back and my gun in my hand, and shaking in my skin. I have not been able to sleep right since then, and for the next couple of months after the incident, I couldn't sleep at all. Everytime I closed my eyes, I would hear the growls and the rocks splashing and then see her coming at me. I would be willing to take someone back up there to show where it happened, but only during daylight hours. I have been a hunter and fisherman most of my life and have seen what I thought, was every animal in the woods at one time or another. Nothing like this has ever shown it's face before, and I hope it never does again. There was another incident however.

"After fishing small stream off Ice House Rd. and driving back on Wentworth Springs Rd. just past Stumpy Meadows campground I stopped at the overflow concrete runway on the dam.

"Last weekend my girfriend and I went to join her family at Sugar Pine Point in El Dorado County next to Lake Tahoe for a camping trip. On the early morning hours of Saturday July 22nd I was awakened by a strange whoop/howl. I immediately woke my girlfriend up and asked her to listen with me. We were sleeping in a tent. The howl we heard was not close to us. It was at a distance but was very loud. My girlfriends' aunt and uncle were sleeping inside a camper trailer about 50 feet away from us and they said they heard it pretty clear. They have been camping there for years and we all agreed that it was something none of us have ever heard. The whoop/howl lasted 3-4 minutes with short intervals of rest. At one point during the whoop/howl, it almost sounded like there was two ""animals/things"" making this strange noise.","It was at Sugar Pine Point camp ground, right off of Highway 89.

"Today, August 23, 2007, I was hiking off-trail in El Dorado County, California in the forest 60 feet north of the Bryan Meadow trail, when at about 10:30 a.m. I saw a tall dark figure peering around a large red fir stump. This was from perhaps 100 feet away, I quickly walked up to the stump, but there was no one there. It would have been possible to move uphill away from me using the large stump as cover, but only a very athletic person could have managed this in the time available. Moving then uphill and to the SE, I regained the Bryan Meadow trail and there noted a large footprint, which I photographed next to my two-way radio. It is about twice the length of my foot, (a size 12 boot size). I do not know the source of this print, but it was where the rapid retreat occurred. I had just parked at the Sierra Ski area (Short Stuff run), and begun walking up the forest north of the trail to Bryan Meadows. I was moving quietly and slowly, crossing from the north side of the stream to the south without being on any trail. Another biologist was still moving up the canyon on the north side of the stream, but was well ahead of my position. It could have been a human, but the person would have to have been wearing all uniformly dark clothing and had a dark complexion or been wearing dark paint. Head to knee, the figure was a uniformly dark hue and no other detail was discernable, except that the shoulders were slightly more narrow than the average person would be, and the height was at least 6'-3"" to 6'-5"". The figure was peering at me from the west end of the stump, leaning forward, so that all above the knee was visible. The figure was of a uniformly dark color, perhaps black.","From US Highway 50, turn south at Sierra at Tahoe Rd.,  enter the Sierra Ski Resort and ask permission to 4x4 to the ""Short Stuff"" run.

"Camped at Jackass Meadow just below Florence Lake.  I was tired from a long day of fishing and driving to Lake Edison, so I ate and fished a little more and retired for the evening.  It was a full moon out and everything was really calm for a campground.  I went to bed in my tent fairly early and woke up several times during the evening.  Every thing was quiet and I got up to store my food in the bearboxes around camp.  I didn't hear anything or see any thing when I was awake.  I went back to bed and nodded off.  I awoke again from my sleep to a noise that I had never heard in the mountains.  It was late, and everyone to my knowledge was asleep.  The noise was coming from the east of the campground i'd say approx. 1/2 a mile to a mile.  I would say that it sounded the same as someone blowing through a conch shell mixed with and large mammal of some sorts.  I heard the noise two times after I awoke in five second intervals, right after one another, and then silence.

"I would like to start with my background as a backpacker and hunter.  I go to the Sierra Nevada Mountains about 1 and a half hours outside of Fresno, California.  Last summer around the time of the sighting, I made about 11 trips to numerous places. This is what I do.  I feel I have a good knowledge of the outdoors, and I have becomes quite at home in the wilderness. On Friday, July 14, 2006 my friends, Jason and one other person who has asked me to exclude his name from this report, started out on a backpacking trip to Hobler Lake in the John Muir Wilderness. We started off our hike a little late in the day, about 5:00 pm, on the Maxsom trailhead, just on the east side of Courtright Reservoir. We were hiking for about an hour, this being about 6:00 pm in the day.  It was dusk when we noticed something moving parallel to us in the woods.  It was hard to make out what it was because of the terrain consisting of dense wooded areas with evergreen trees.  It had a reddish brown color, and in the distance you could tell it was much bigger than a person was.  We assumed it was a black bear so we moved on. Whatever it was seemed quite interested in us.  Every time we stopped, it would stop moving as well.  This continued for about an hour until it got too dark to see clearly without a flashlight. We continued hiking to our destination for a while when I started hearing a crackling of branches to my left about 50 feet behind me, maybe less.  When I turned around, I saw a black outline of something looking at me from behind a tree.  I froze for a second because I was in such shock over what I was seeing.  Out of all the animals I’ve seen at night in the mountains, this had no resemblance.  It was standing on two legs, was about 7 and one half feet tall, and was 4 feet wide at the shoulders.  It had hardly no neck, and very long arms that hung down by its mid legs.  It also had a fluffy appearance like it had a thick long coat of fur. Then I whispered to my friend Jason to shine a flashlight on it.  As I said that, this thing must have heard me, because it turned around and started walking off somewhat fast.  At this time we decided to load our firearms, which weren’t much because all we had was a 40 caliber pistol and a 22 pistol.  For a time, whatever it was seemed to have left the area. We arrived at Hobler Lake around 10:00 pm.  We set up our camp, cooked some food, and rested for a bit.  I finally fell asleep about 11:30 pm, but Jason and my other friend stayed up. When I awoke in the morning, Jason told me that he and bob were by the lake having a cigarette when they heard large objects crashing in the water about 100 yards from them.  He described it a like something very large was jumping and thrashing in the water. The next day we were staying close to camp because of all that went on.  We walked about away from camp to explore the area when we heard noise from camp like the clinking of pots and stuff.  We ran back to camp to find nothing out of place, but when looked closer some things were slightly moved, but not very far away from where we left them.","You take Highway 168 east out of Fresno to Shaver Lake.

"It was late October 2006. My hunting partner and I were deer hunting near Heart Lake, which is located off the John Muir Trail behind Florence Lake.  We'd been back there for almost a week looking for the elusive Big Daddy Buck that we've hunted religiously for the last three years. We were high up on this ridge just before nightfall.  We were hiking back to our base camp and heard a loud bellowing howl that sent a shiver down our spines.  We looked at each other with confused looks on our faces, not knowing what that sound was.  We decided to hurry back to camp, but we heard another howl, but closer this time.  We saw Big Daddy Buck running down the opposite ridge side, and busting through brush, not caring if hunters spotted him.  Then again, we heard that bellowing howl, and saw on top of the ridge a dark silhouette that looked like a bear standing on its hind feet.  I brought my rifle scope to my eye to take aim on this so-called bear.  As I looked through the scope, I realized it was no bear.  I thought it could have been a really tall man in some kind of camouflage suit, but it looked like no man that I have ever seen.  It ran down the hill and disappeared into the brush, like it was chasing the deer.  So we decided to go and track down this creature.  Once we arrived at where it was standing, there was a footprint in the dirt that made my footprint look like a child's footprint.  It was four times the size of mine. We never saw the creature again and never heard that howl, but then again, I've never gone back since then.",,Fresno County,California,Fall,Report 18325: Possible sighting and howls heard by deer hunters in John Muir Wilderness.,37.28675,-118.8741,10/26/2006,18325,Class B,9qekngye09,50.21,36.675,23.14,11.23,0.43,0,0.15,0,0,,1026.43,Clear throughout the day.,5,10,233,0.55

"My wife and I were elk hunting. We went up to our favorite area Beaver Meadows. We had decided to try a different area the next week. We went back up Beaver Meadows road and went off on Bear Creek road. We went down an old logging road. My wife and I had gone about 100 yards when my wife said do you smell that. I smelled the air and said no. I left her on a stump and I went a ways further. I found a place for myself. Looking over a meadow I started to smell this fowl wet musty odor. Then I heard a loud crack, not a gun shot, not an ax, but more like a log hitting another. I walked back to my wife and explained the smell and she said that was what she smelled. We started back toward the truck when my wife tripped. I looked down to see what she tripped on. To my surprise a huge track, not a bear, it was about 16 inches long and 6 inches wide no claw marks. There were two tracks. I am six foot tall and could not even match the stride.

"It was in 1978... My former husband and I had taken our children for a picnic at Wellington Lake, just south of Buffalo Creek, Colorado.  What I saw was not the same as what I've seen in photos, however, what I saw was a bipedal creature with white fur.  This may sound strange, but, I was talking with my former husband when the creature stepped out from behind a boulder.  I told my now exhusband, to look.  He turned around but the creature ducked back behind the boulder.  My exhusband turned back to me and said, ""I didn't see anything."" At that very moment the creature showed itself to me again.  I told my ex to turn around.  He did, and the creature ducked behind the boulder again.  This happened four or five times, and then the creature was gone.  The creature was partially bipedal and then would stoop like an ape and touch the ground. It had a human-like feeling about it because it was obviously playing some sort of a game with me.  I have never told anybody except for people I trust not to make fun of me.  I was a resident in the area for many years and I knew what wildlife was there...nothing came close to this creature.

After hearing nothing for a few minutes I decided to call, when I bugeled from the ridge opposit us we herd what seemed like part elk, part cat, whining, but it sounded like there was 20 or 30 animals on the ridge across from us all making this moening/whining type noise. It lasted about 15 seconds. I wasent sure what I had just heard so I bugeled again we heard the same noise again. I didn't recignize the noise and the hair on the back of my neck was standing up so I decided to leave.

"My son and I were turkey hunting on BLM land near Fort Carson, CO. We arrived in the area around 0930hrs. My son is only 3 and 1/2 years old, so we were moving slowly to find a good spot to set up. We were approximately 500 yards off the west side of Sate Hwy 115 in the Table Mountain area. We found a decent site to set up on and started our hunt. I called a few times with my diaphram calls and we heard one turkey gobble about 100yds away. My sun was busy playing with rocks right next to our site. At about 1030hrs I noticed a truck driving down a dirt road that runs through the area. I watched the truck drive through the area and as it turned down a left hand bend in the road, I caught some movement out the corner of my right eye. The movement was approximately 600yds away. I picked up my binoculars to get a better look, hoping it was a turkey coming in to my calls. When I got focused on the object, it definately appeared larger than a turkey, so I checked it out more and focused the lenses better. What I saw, I don't know for sure, but it appeared to be walking upright on its hind legs and and was covering a great deal of ground in a short span of time but was not running. I estimated the being to be approximately 6-7ft in height. It was walking northwest from my location. After about a minute or two it disappeared into some high brush and thickets. That terrain went up and over a little rise. I did not see anything else after that. We left the area about an hour later.

"My boyfriend and I were on the last night of a week-long vacation/road trip.  In the past few days, we were just driving through SW Colorado, driving through areas we had not seen before. We had driven over Spring Creek Pass (going South).  We drove West on a dirt road, into a high valley with a stream.  We parked during sunset/moonrise, just off the road and near the stream (a pullout-type area).  My boyfriend wanted to get some fishing in before it got too dark.  So we quickly started to get a quick dinner together (soup) and get our gear ready for the night.  We were not going to put up the tent, but instead took some gear out of the truck bed (truck has a topper) and we were going to sleep in it.  We were moving pretty quick to get this stuff done so he could fish, so I guess we weren't paying much attention to other stuff.  We did stop to take a few pictures of the rising moon. He went over to the stream to fish, and I started to eat my soup in my camp chair.  The bushes near the stream were very tall and thick, and I couldn't see my boyfriend at all.  There were more bushes on the other side of the truck (between the main road and truck).  I was just eating my soup, when I heard loud crashing through these bushes (between the road and truck).  It sounded like something very big with very long legs stepping through the brush, and it was coming right towards the truck.  The brush came very close to the truck (less than 10 ft). At first, I thought this might a moose.  (We had seen moose in the Northern Colorado mtns earlier in the spring, and we had seen a sign posted near the road warning a moose had been seen in the area (""Hunters, be sure of your target..."").  So, I first thought this could be a moose.  It was definitely very big and had long legs (much bigger than an elk, and not a bear).  (We have also seen bear in Colorado, so I've seen the size/movement of bear.) The last thing I wanted was a big moose (or anything else) to step out of that brush (and on me)!  I was very scared.  I quickly made room in the front seat, which were now filled with gear, and started honking the horn.  I wanted it to know I was there (because it sounded like it was going to pop out of there pretty quick).  The crashing continued but seemed to move off a bit.  Then it stopped.  I couldn't be sure if it had completely moved away or just stopped.  My concern was also for my boyfriend.  I didn't want a moose to come across him in the bushes by the creek.  My boyfriend heard the honking, and I could hear him coming back.  The bushes were very thick and he was swearing, struggling.  He returned, I explained the situation.  Irritated and with fishing pole in hand, he walked up to and down the road a short ways and didn't see anything. If it were a moose we felt we would have seen it (he from the higher road or I would have seen it crossing the pullout to the stream).  My boyfriend would have been able to see if a moose was in/near the bushes near the truck, from that higher position.  At this point I heard very low growling, faint (very deep, very low).  It seemed to come from the tree line across the road and part way up the hill.  It was brief (seemed like 4 growls), and over by the time my boyfriend came back.  I didn't tell him at that point, because it didn't make sense, and I didn't want him getting irritated for my being spooked. He went back to the creek.  I sat in the truck and ate my soup, window half down to listen.  I heard more noise from the same area as before, this time loud splooshing and splashing (there was a drainage with water that was coming down from the hill to meet the creek).  The noise was very loud and distinctive, not at all like natural water sounds.  It sounded like something big splooshing in the water. My boyfriend came back, saying it was getting too dark to fish.  He sat in the truck with me and ate.  I started to tell him about the splooshing (which stopped when he came back) and the growling from earlier.  He was disturbed and said we should leave. We both knew it wasn't a moose.  We felt he would have seen it from the road.  We also knew a moose would have not have just hung around making more noise once it knew we were there.  I thought it was too big to be an elk/deer/bear.  We felt something was still there and we couldn't see it. We quickly put all the stuff in the truck and drove off. I was surprised that he was so scared, very unusual for him.  He finally told me that he had found big footprints by the stream, in the mud.  He said they were huge, much bigger than his print, and much deeper (the thing would have to have a large foot and be extremely heavy).  He had seen other tracks by the stream, from other animals and from a person earlier in the day (sneaker-type print).  He said no man could have made those bigger tracks.  He said the tracks also went into deeper brush.  When he was working his way back to the truck, he would try to follow these tracks out, but would only end up in deeper brush (thats why he was swearing). He said he was wondering at the time, ""Where is this idiot going?  Why is he going into the brush?"".  He thought there were tracks from more than one, at least two, and from that day. I asked him, why didn't he say something the first time when he came back. He admitted it took some time to process.  He also said that it felt like something was in there with him, in the brush. He said it took him time to put everything together, the crashing, the growling, the thing not leaving, the giant footprints, the uneasiness.  We both concluded it was likely a bigfoot.  Giant footprints like that are hard to argue with. The noises were made from a big animal , but he didn't see anything from the road.  My boyfriend said these things must have been intelligent.  They seemed to be watching/waiting/hiding.  They knew when he walked away and came back. When we drove away from the pullout, I had a good look at the brush between the road and truck, and it amazed me how small an area it was.  If something big was in there, and it didn't leave, it would really have to hide in there. I've always believed in bigfoots, but my boyfriend has always been skeptical (even despite the visual sightings by his step-dad, his friend, and his own odd experiences).  But he thinks it was a bigfoot.  I wish I had seen the tracks, but there was no way! Also, I don't think I've ever seen my boyfriend that scared.  He just kept driving.  When we finally pulled over somewhere. He wouldn't get out of the truck.","A little South of Spring Creek Pass, to the West of highway 149.  Don't know the name/number of the dirt road we took.

"I was determined to summit Mt. Elbert, the highest peak in Colorado. I had made 2 previous attempts in 2001 and 2000 and on both attempts I was turned back at 13,000 ft. by weather. I have always gone solo. On this day May 29th 2002 I left the Black Cloud Trailhead at 7:00am solo. I summited Mt. Elbert at 1:45pm. The weather was perfect and unseasonably warm. There must have been very little snow during the winter because there was very little snow left even at summit. I stayed on top for 10 minutes took pictures with my digital camera. My sighting occured around 3:30pm at approximately. 11,500 feet. I was decending and very tired.The trail is not very popular because of its steepness and because it's very rugged in spots. I did not see anyone the whole day. I was traveling on the trail through the only level portion which is a high mountain plateau that lasts maybe 300 yards. The trail hugs an avalanche area to the left and to the right is a pine forest which is moderately dense. As I was walking I heard a fairly high pitched but gutteral cross between a scream and a growl. It must have been heard for miles. I froze in my tracks and unsnapped my holster. I scanned in the direction I thought it originated from but it's hard to tell in the mountains because of echo. I looked to the right first into the forest and saw nothing, then slowly did a 360 scan and now I'm looking back to the forest. At 50 yards I spot the bigfoot. It is standing still facing me approx. 7 feet to 7 1/2 feet tall. I was wearing army camo and I think it had a hard time figuring me out for a few seconds. I was so scared and astonished at what I was looking at I could not move.Then suddenly it turned and ran with a huge stride and it was fast. Its color was black and brown mixed and its fur or hair was thick and matted in spots. It ran like a man except with a slightly haunched upper back and a much bigger and more powerful gait. I lost sight of it in about 10 seconds after it began to run. At this point I pulled my pistol and immediately started cautiously down the trail. My heart was beating so hard I thought it was going to come out of my chest. I could actually hear it beating in my ears.I was no longer tired and the adrenaline was pumping. All the way down the trail I was doing looks over my shoulder and scanning everything. My camera was in my light backpack and I didn't even think about it till I got back to the cabin I rented. I know what I saw and nobody can take that away from me but I didn't dare talk about it until I accidently stumbled upon this website. I hope this helps your research.","At 14,433 ft. (4409m) Mt.

"The BFRO Colorado Expedition was conducted in a remote area in the same part of Colorado as some major ski areas -- Vail, Ski Cooper, and Breckenridge. The area was heavily forested and had plenty of water. The expedition was well planned and was executed well. The majority of the participants arrived at the initial base camp location on 8 Sept and individual camps (groups of two-three) were positioned along the drainage. We had all been briefed on the history of sightings, tracks, and vocalizations in the area,  and the methods we'd use to determine their presence. We spread out that evening, stayed in touch via walkie talkie, and conducted wood knocking and calling in an coordinated manner. We had night vision devices, recording devices, and IR detection equipment.  We worked well into the early morning hours (2 AM). Nothing was heard.  The next morning (9 Sept) the guides said we should move the base camp to another target area, because we would have heard any sasquatches the night before if they were in that drainage. We drove a few hours to a new location across the Continental Divide. The night of 9 Sept was spent in canyon near the new base camp.  Participants were positioned a half mile to quarter mile intervals (I think) with the sound blaster positioned in the middle of the group. The calls and wood knocks announced and timed so as not to be confused with a response. Nothing was heard. The next day (10 Sept.), the focus moved to a different canyon, near where some possible vocalizations were heard the night before by one of the guides. A group of five or six worked the top of the drainage from well above the timber line and hiked down in the direction of the base camp.  Two others worked the road on ATVs above the valley, and a few others worked the hillsides above the drainage. I hiked up the same drainage starting from the base camp. As I was walking up the trail next to the creek, about a mile or so from camp, I was in radio contact with the group above me. We would announce when we would call or wood knock. We could hear the knocks and calls between us, but just barely. I proceeded to a fork in the trail and found an old hunting camp site that had been used in previous years but had shown no signs of recent use.  I started to take an old trail that went through the camp site when I heard two distinct and clear wood knocks to my left approximately 150 - 200 yards away at most – close enough to startle me significantly as I was by my self. I stopped and immediately got on the radio – no one was within a mile of two of me and no one had said they were knocking.  The sound was much closer and more distinct that those made by the guys way up on the ridge above me. After about two minutes, I picked up a large stick and made two or three loud wood knocks in reply.  I got an immediate response of two knocks that appeared to be a little farther away (maybe 300-400 yards) but still very clear.  The knocks were similar to the first I had heard but just a little farther away. I responded again with knocks and then a whoop or two over a 30 minute period but got no additional replies.  I was alert to any movement or smells in the area but noticed none. Eventually I decided to return to base camp.  After arriving at camp I linked up with a few other guys. We road ATVs to the location where I heard the knocks to investigate further.  One guy took the ATV further on the trail that forked to the left at the old camp site. He went for about .7 miles in the direction where the sound came from. He later said he noticed a musty smell in that area.  The group that worked the drainage from the top had found a couple of sets of tracks (which they photographed). I saw the pictures and thought they were pretty clear. As they moved down the valley they also noticed a distinct smell about 500 yards to the left of the above referenced wood knock incident. This is the same area where Lee picked up the smell and turned around on the trail. Some things happened later that night around the base camp. I'll let the others describe those incidents.  I recommend that as a prerequisite for attending expeditions, each attendee should listen closely to the Sierra Sounds CD.  I bought it after the trip and wish I had heard it before the trip. It gives a good understanding of what they sound like, the wood knocks, the vocalizations, and all.  The expedition guides from the BFRO were very informative and helpful. They brought a lot of experience to the event. The guides from Colorado had extensive knowledge of the encounters in this area, including some of their own. Other attendees were witnesses from Colorado. I hope to work with the Colorado guides and the other newbies over the next year (may even be up for a trip to Wyoming). I now have a working sound blaster, and a couple of digital trail cams – enough to be dangerous.  I hope to attend some of the other expeditions over the next year (Oklahoma, Arizona or Oregon) and work with this group again. My wife thinks I have lost it. I have to get her involved.

"(Job title edited at witness request for privacy).  I am currently on a contract in Rifle Colorado.  My home is 5 1/2 hrs south of Rifle so I stay in my camper 5 days a week.  This morning, I left my home at 0245 as per usual.  I stopped in Buena Vista to fuel up and get a coffee.  As I came thru the little town of Twin Lakes, I was just feeling tired and the more I drove, the sleepier I got.  So before I started up Independence Pass, I thought I would pull over and get some fresh air.  (I had just noted that it was 36 degrees on the truck temp. gauge and even took a picture of it on my phone, to send to my brother in Virginia).  I pulled over to the left side of the road.  As I got out of the truck, I noticed movement in the meadow directly in front of me.  Not more than 3-4 miles below here, I had just seen a buck deer so I was thinking that I had probably flushed another deer.  As I walked to the rear of my truck, I continued to look out in the meadow and that is when I saw this thing move.  At first I thought it was a bear but it rose straight up and that is when I knew it wasn't a bear.  A bear's front legs hang in front of their belly when they stand and these did not.  The ""arms"" hung to the sides just like a person.  Only if this was a person, he was really tall.  It was furry and a deep brown/red in color. I was so frightened that I thought I would throw up.  As I moved back toward my truck door, it tipped its head back as if it was smelling the air.  When I opened the truck door, it turned, bent over and picked something up and began to run on two legs across the meadow away from me. Not running like sprinting, but running at a pace that he could probably continue for hours. Honestly, the thing that struck me most about this was the way it picked up, whatever it was, and carried it with both hands clasped together in front of its torso. By now I was back in my truck, shaking and tearful. I live in my camper 5 days a week.  I move from State Park to State Park.  I see wildlife daily.  I just saw a black bear Sunday evening and I know what they look like when they stand, how they grunt and grumble.  I know how they lumber and run...this was not a bear.  It was like nothing I have ever seen.","Base of Independence Pass.  This is the border of Lake and Pitkin County.

"While hunting in Moffat County, Colorado, my wife and I both heard a sound that was inexplicable to either of us. There is no doubt in my mind that what I was hearing was a vocalization of some sort. I have spent my entire life in Colorado, and spent quite a bit of time in the outdoors, and this sound was unlike anything I have ever heard, and I can not imagine any animal in Colorado that would be capable of making this sound. It started as a very low range roar, of sorts, and built in volume and range to a high pitched, very primal scream. The sound was very, very loud, and very ""large"", for lack of a better word. The sound came from an area closed to vehicles, and it echoed from the surrounding hills. The duration was about 6-7 seconds, and it was repeated 4 times in the course of about 90 seconds. This sound was so primal, so intense, so big, that it raised the hair on my arms and the back of my neck, and I was chilled as I have never been before in the wilderness. I know what bear, elk, raptors, and big cats sound like in Colorado, and I assure you, this was nothing like I have ever even imagined.","At the southern end of the Danforth Hills, on private property known as the Morgan Creek Ranch, owned by the Colowyo Coal Company.

"Possible footprint observation, FR 578 near Hermosa Peak, Dolores County Colorado, Friday, June 20, 2003 We were staying in a cabin northeast of Vallecitos on Middle Mountain, just off of FR 724.  I arrived in the area Tuesday the 17th of June.  We had spent several days in the area, including trips to Mesa Verde, horseback riding on West Mountain in the Weminuche Wilderness, and fourwheeling up FR 724 on Middle Mountain. Friday morning (the 20th), we drove into Durango and rented a couple of late model Jeeps.  We drove out to attempt a drive on FR 682 but found it closed due to a recent fire.  The Jeep rental folks had suggested FR 578 as an alternate if we found 682 closed, so we proceeded north on US 550 to the Purgatory\Durango Mountain Resort area and picked up FR 578.  At the junction we followed FR 578 and took it up through the Graysill Mine and Graysill ghost town, over Bolam Pass, and then west from the junction with TR 638. We followed FR 578 until the trail terminates at a berm installed on a spur of FR 578, presumably installed to close the trail to motorized traffic.  While my wife and daughter and I stopped to eat lunch, my sister, brother-in-law and father hiked towards the base of Hermosa Peak (12,579 ft).  I estimate we were at approximately 11,500 to 12,000 feet, near the timberline. When they returned from their hike (about 3 PM), my sister (age 28) reported that she had noticed what she thought looked like a large bare human footprint on a closed portion of trail, approximately ¼ mile WSW from the berm. Having been interested in the Bigfoot phenomenon for some time, I though she might be pulling my leg but I took my video camera and we walked down the path together, looking for where she thought she had seen the footprint.  We noticed a large amount of Elk sign in the area, and what appeared to be motorcycle tire tracks. We had not noticed anything and had actually started back towards the area where the Jeeps were parked when she found the print.  I videotaped the print, and compared my hiking boot (size 12) to the print.  The print appeared to be perhaps 2 inches longer than my hiking boot which measures 12¾ inches, and about 1 to 2 inches wider than my hiking boot which measures about 5 inches wide, making the print approximately 14½ or 15 inches long by about 6 to 7 inches wide.  The print had what appeared to be a clear heel line, foot shape, ball print and toe marks.  The print appeared to be a left foot. As we continued towards the Jeeps, we found another print, much more clear than the previous print about 3½ to 4 feet away.  When we first observe this print I am clearly heard on the tape to say “Oh my God” because the print was so obvious.  This print appeared to be a right foot.  Relative size compared to my hiking boot was similar to that noticed on the first print.  This print had more definition of the heel print, arch and ball print, indicated flexibility due to a sharp rock that would have been near the center of the foot, and had five very distinct toe marks.  The rock appeared to have been displaced either by whatever made the print, or subsequent to that by the passing of Elk or my family.  My sister joked at this point that “he stubbed his toe” due to the shape of the print and proximity to other rocks. About 3 or 4 feet further along the trail (heading back ENE) we found a third print that was not as easy to distinguish but which approximately matched the distance from the first to second print and was again similar in size.  The ground on the trail was getting progressively harder and more stoney, but this appeared to be a left foot again. No further prints were observed as we made our way back to the Jeeps, but we continued to observe Elk prints made in the muddy sides of the closed trail (evidenced by curling and ridges on the prints). I initially took the whole event in a rather non-serious way, even though I have been a real student of Bigfoot stories and research for sometime, especially during my teens and early twenties.  In hindsight, we could have marked the prints and tried to take more accurate measurements of gait, print size, even sketched them, as well as heading back down the trail (towards Hermosa Peak) where the ground was softer and more likely to have recorded additional prints.  We also could have looked around the area for other signs, there were several nearby stands of trees, snow and other fresh water sources. I do have several minutes of video that includes the surrounding area to verify my location and for reference, and this includes some clear images of all three prints.  I weigh about 180 pounds and made very little in the way of tracks in the dirt, with only occasional traces of boot tread showing in the same area.  I do not recall noticing ridges on the prints indicating they were not likely made while the ground was overly wet or muddy. I am 33, do not drink or smoke, work in management at an aerospace company, and am married with a 7 year old daughter.  Having had several days now to think about this event, and to have gauged the reactions of the few folks I have told about our observations, I am still not exactly sure what we saw and what I taped, but it definitely appears to be large humanoid footprints, made in varying terrain, showing a 3 to 4 foot gait and a foot that is somewhere near 14 or 15 inches long and about 6 or 7 inches wide. I am not a great outdoorsman but I am aware that some bear prints can appear almost human, but the video shows what I believe to have been clear human or humanoid footprints with no evidence of claws as on a bear. Honestly, the thought now that we might have seen footprints of a large animal such as Bigfoot is quite unsettling, and made me uneasy at night, both while in the cabin near Vallecitos, and even at my home in Rio Rancho, near Albuquerque.

We watched the boxing match and after it was over we started to head back to Pagosa Springs on Cromo Rd and we were almost to Highway 84 when about 20 yards in front of us this thing or big foot crossed and went quickly, almost as if we were seeing things. I didn't know what to think, so I asked Sammy if he saw it, and he said, What was that?  We got up to where it crossed and I opened my door to look down on the road and saw a foot print and Sammy opened his door and saw a track too. We both freaked out and I drove as fast I could to Pagosa Springs. We didn't tell that many people, only the ones that would believe us.

"Two friends and I went camping in the San Juan National Forest just east of Lake Vallecito on 6-1-04. DC and I were from out of state but JG was a regular camper there. We went 12 miles up the forest service rd. and picked a campsite. We saw no one else that day and it was a dead-end road. JG said it was the first time he'd been there alone. We spent the day hiking around and cooking meat over the campfire. We did not see or hear anything unusual that day other than a partial horse skeleton. At about midnight, we were winding down when we heard three, 2-tone howls to the hill approx. 1/4 mile to our north. We knew it was not a coyote but almost sounded like a person trying to imitate a coyote because it had a deeper bass tone. About five minutes later, we heard the same thing again. Then I heard something like a gunshot in the same area but there was no sonic crack. It was like something hit a tree really hard. Both sounds came from the same place as the first set of howls. We were all standing around the fire wondering what it was. JG had his shotgun in hand and we were all starting to get a little edgy. We all are police/former police/former military so it takes a lot to get any of us ""edgy."" We all have camping experience and none of us had ever experienced anything like this before. About five minutes later, directly to our west, was a very loud 2-tone howl approx. 100 yds. away. It howled again and it was closer so it was closing in on us. DC and I drew our pistols and flashlights and all of us focused on the logging rd. that it/they would have to cross to get to us. There was a bright full moon so the open areas were well illuminated. It howled one more 2-tone howl before stopping at what we estimated to be 50 yds. away in the woodline. It seemed like it covered at least 50 yds. going through the woods while howling three times. Whatever it was was BIG and LOUD! There was a lot more bass to the howls than a dog/coyote/wolf has. Each time it howled it was 2-tone, in a series of three and it seemed unemotional or intelligent. About a minute later, another series of three 2-toned howls came from the hill to the south approx. 1/4 mile away. It seemed to be answering the one hiding in the treeline in front of us. Then the one in the treeline let out three more of the same howls. Let me stress again, this thing was LOUD! We were all pretty shaken. We felt that we had aroused at least three, big things that were communicating among themselves and closing in on us. We were all facing out from a dying fire with weapons and flashlights drawn. We didn't know if we were being studied or they were getting in position for attack. We decided to leave. After some debate, we decided to pack the trucks while one of us took turns watching with flashlight and gun. A few minutes later we were packed and headed down the mountain to the main rd. We did not see or hear anything while packing or leaving. When we got to the road, we stopped to unload our guns and stow them legally in the trucks. There was one house close to the road and after a while the dogs started to bark. I joked to JG that ""they"" were coming after us. Just then, we heard another set of howls about a mile back the rd. we'd just come down. Whatever it was had followed us and we left immediately. We were not sure what it was that night but after talking about the incident quite a bit, we think we had a Bigfoot encounter. It was a remote, wooded, mountain location with a large lake over the hill. There were at least three intelligent beings communicating that sounded loud and large. We had been leaving our scent all around and had been cooking meat all day. No person would be crazy enough to risk getting shot playing a prank on us. The howls were very eerie. Like I said, they were all like the first 2-tones of a wolf howl but much deeper. There was no trailing off like a dog/coyote/wolf howl, just 2-tones. Each 2-tone howl was in a series of three howls that took approx. 5-6 seconds per series. The only thing missing from the encounter was the lack of the famous Bigfoot stench. There was no wind so maybe the thing in the treeline was far enough away for it not to reach us. We are not out to hoax anyone. We hope none of our colleagues find out so our day to day judgment is not questioned or ridiculed. This was the first time any of us had seen any of the other ones scared. We just felt that we had to share our experience for what its worth.",The encounter took place above Beaver Meadow Spring in the San Juan National Forest east of Vallecito Reservoir.

"I was driving south down from the mountain on my regular route I had my high beams on because its dark in that area. Its very rural when all of sudden a large up right dark figure stepped out into the road I stopped and watch it cross the road in three steps. This thing was so tall that it stood at least a foot and half above the rack on the roof of my Jeep Grand Cherokee. The legs were long and it bent at the knees like a human. All I seen was the side profile of it. It was very tall and from what I could see the head was large and long, the shoulder span was very wide. The side profile of the face was flat. It very quickly in three steps crossed the road.(its a wide two lane road). After it crossed I drove forward a little and tried to see where it went but couldn't see it any more. This thing was frightening. I have been looking for it everytime I'm on my route but had not seen it again. On my other route which is on county road 306 about a 10min drive from this incident two days later there was a very strange strong smell in the area around 3am again.

"The following is a report of unusual noises.  First, I would like to qualify myself as a competent woodsman...certainly no 19th century mountain man, but one who knows his way around the outdoors.  I was camping in the Rio Grande National Forest in Conejos County Colorado in September of 2005.  For those famaliar with this geographical area, I was in a district of the forest known locally and on topo maps as 'Jacob's Hill.'  I have hunted and camped in this area for many many years.  It was in late September and I was sitting in front of my campfire around 9 pm when I heard the most bone chilling and indescribable wailing roar that I have ever heard.  It was a very throaty sound and could best be described as an animal in agony.  While I have never heard a mountain lion roar in person I have heard this and other ""cat"" noises on T.V. and this did not sound at all like those noises.  The closest thing I could relate it to would be the noise of a hereford bull bellowing....but it was not that either.  The sound continued uninterrupted for about 5-10 seconds and then ceased.  Immediately coyotes from several different locales in the vicinity began howling and yelping as tho very disturbed.  I did not hear the noise again during that particular outing. Now, fast forward 2 months into November in camp in the same location for the elk hunting season. Bear in mind that until this moment in November I had not mentioned this incident to anyone.  I awoke at 4 AM one cold morning and noticed that someone else was awake and had built our camp fire again.  Because I was going to get up in another hour or so anyway, I got up and stepped outside.  It was my brother prowling around and I asked why he was up so early.  He replied that he had gotten up to go to the bathroom and the weirdest thing had happened.  I interrupted him immediately and told that before he told me what had happened I wanted to tell him about my experience.  I related to him the very story I told above.  When I was finished my brother just looked at me in amazement and said that is exactly what he had just experienced verbatim; right down to the coyotes reacting.  He, like me, could not relate the sound to anything we had ever seen or heard.","[GPS coordinates were supplied, and are shown in the internal database, but have been removed by the Editor from the public version of the report.]",Conejos County,Colorado,Fall,Report 19804: Hunter reports unusual roars In South San Juan Mountains,37.3199,-106.3325,9/20/2005,19804,Class B,9wskk3gh1j,66.13,56.935,47.74,25,0.32,0.06,0.6,0,0,,1026.01,Clear throughout the day.,8,10,240,2.42
"Let me begin this with a brief bit of information about the area.  The South San Juan Wilderness (in the San Juan Mountains of southwestern Colorado) is considered to be Colorado’s wildest corner.  It was in the backcountry of this wilderness in the fall of either 1977 or 1979 (I forget which) that a sow Grizzly Bear was startled and attacked a bow hunter.  He was mauled but managed to kill the bear with an arrow he repeatedly drove into the bear’s chest.  It was thought that the Grizzly had long been extirpated from all of Colorado.  If there are Grizzlies still in Colorado, this is where they are thought to be. I have been hiking, backpacking, camping, and fly-fishing in this area for about six years now, making about 2-3 trips per spring/summer/fall and one of those trips usually includes a backpack into the backcountry.  I am very familiar with the sounds the various animals make in the forests and mountains of the west and of this specific area. On this trip I managed to sneak away for a three day weekend in mid-June with the new lab.  I heard that the Salmon-fly hatch had started and wanted to try to get a piece of the action fly-fishing for big, aggressive trout. I figured I would save myself a few dollars by not camping in the developed Forest Service campsites and enjoy some solitude at the same time.  So I camped in a large series of meadows known as the Trail Creek Primitive Camping area; no water, no services, just camp where you will.  I was about 15 miles from the tiny community of Platoro at the upper end of the Conejos valley and maybe 10-15 miles from the next nearest community of assorted vacation houses known as Rocky Mountain Estates back down the valley.  I did not realize it at the time but this was a remote area even though the dirt road that ran up and down the valley was only about a ½ mile across the meadows from my camping spot.  Behind me by about 50 yards was the edge of a 150’ moderate canyon of the upper section of the Pinnacles run of the Conejos River.  On the other side of the canyon, which is steep but easily crossed by humans, is a huge, expansive mountainside of aspen groves, spruce and fir trees, and mountain meadows.  This is the beginning edge of the South San Juan Wilderness Area. The second evening I had cooked dinner and taken the lab out for a last evening walk around the meadows.  It had been a good day of fishing and we were both tired.  We went to bed in the tent just at dark.  It was a night of an almost full moon.  We both fell asleep quickly. A bit later I awoke and thought I head something outside the tent, probably a deer.  But because I was curious I sat awake for a bit and listened.  After about 10 minutes from out of nowhere I heard this unreal, LOUD, clear, resonant, scream/screech/howl/roar type sound from not too far away.  It sounded maybe 300-400 yards away and like it might have been just across the canyon on the mountainside.  It was like no sound I have ever heard in my life.  It was fairly high-pitched and did not have the rough, gravelly sound that cats have when they roar and call.  It was clear, even crisp, loud, and lasted for about 5-6 seconds.  It seemed to be two parts screaming howl and one part roar, as it had that deep quality but was still high-pitched.  I sat there for a minute stunned, and then realized what it must be. I have read accounts on this website before about the sounds these creatures supposedly make, and this was what came to mind.  (So I guess chance does favor the prepared mind.)  And it was not that far away.  The sound seemed to be coming directly toward me, like it might have been screaming at or towards me or this meadow area where people sometimes camp.  It felt territorial, aggressive, even a little threatening.  Even though I had a .357 loaded with hot hollow points and a strong flashlight, the prospect of encountering some big, hairy “man-thing” outside my tent in the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere, and alone, was a little more than I wanted to deal with.  I got the dog in the truck and got the hell out of there, with the .357 in my lap.  After a few minutes on the way back down the valley toward an area where I could sleep in peace I sort of had a delayed reaction.  I became unnerved and thought that if I actually see one of these things in the headlights or on the side of the road next to my truck as I passed it I might really lose it.  I was that rattled.  I have lived and backpacked extensively in Montana and in the Canadian Rockies and dealt with the reality of Grizzly bears with no real problem.  But this noise and the creature that most likely made it really freaked me out. After sleeping in the car in the nearest little town of Antonito (I could not find any lodging at 11:30 at night) I went back a little after daybreak to look around and to get ready for another day of fishing.  I ate a cautious breakfast and kept looking around, worried I might actually see one of these things.  But in the daylight I was not quite as unnerved.  I did not find any tracks in the greater area in which I was camping as it was mostly grass, although I did walk around and search for a bit. When I got home I went online and listened to recordings of Mountain Lions and Bobcats, although I know these sounds and have actually seen a Mountain Lion up close in the wild.  The sound was definitely not one of these.  But when I went to this website and listened to some of the recordings I realized it had to be one of these creatures.  This sound was a bit higher in pitch than some of the other recordings, but VERY similar in most other respects. Now I am paranoid and worry that I might not be doing any more backpacking in this beautiful and remote area for fear of running into one of these spooky creatures, especially at night.","I was in the Trail Creek Primitive Camping Area, just off of FR 250, about 30(?) miles up the Conejos Valley from the turnoff at Horca, CO.",Conejos County,Colorado,Summer,Report 24068: Possible vocalization frightens fisherman from campsite along Conejos River,37.26505,-106.4745,6/21/2008,24068,Class B,9ws7cpgssk,69.16,57.47,45.78,30.11,0.36,0.21,0.59,0,0,,,Mostly cloudy until evening.,9,6.65,196,0.44

"I work at Arrowhead Golfcourse in Roxborough, Colorado.  Me and two other of my co-workers were going around getting all of the flags at the end of the night.  As we were going around the corner for hole 13 (it backs up to Roxborough State Park), out of the corner of our eyes we saw this huge whitish grey figure that was clearly distinguished as a large human like figure.  Maybe about 7-8 feet tall.  Then we went around the corner before realizing what we had seen.  We sat for a second and I questioned my friend as to if he had just seen something as well.  The answer was ""yes"" and we turned around to go back to where we had seen it.  When going around the corner my two friends had seen it again. unfortunatley I missed the second sighting.  Acording to my friend the ""figure"" had peeked its head around the corner and stared at them.  They claim to have seen a ""shoulder"" move and then started screaming.  Once they started screaming the ""figure"" moved and was out of sight.  We put the golfcart into reverse and drove out of that area as fast as possible.  We went up to the cart barn and got a cart that was fully enclosed that had front headlights and went back to hole 13.  As we got there we stopped around the corner (just before the point in which my friends saw the shoulder move) to see if we could find footprints or anything out of the ordinary.  As we sat there, we started hearing very strange creaking noises that came from the back and to the left of us.  We stood there listening to this sound  for about 5-10 seconds and nobody was moving because we were all scared to death.  We left the area quickly.

"Two incidents, years apart, same woods Background: I have been hunting in North Florida for 30 years; have a BS in Wildlife Ecology, and a MS in Fisheries. I am employed as a research biologist for a federal agency. My brother and I have a long-standing tradition of hunting in the Apalachicola NF every Martin Luther King weekend. We hunt a chunk of Ochlockonee River bottom in Wakulla County, accessing it from the Huey Arnold boat ramp, near Telogia. There have been two incidents during these hunts that haunt me. Mind you, I have hunted about every WMA in North Florida, spending three to four weeks a year in the woods, for 35 years. For work, I have been on most of the rivers in the Southeast. These two incidents are the only two where I didn’t know, or could not make an inference about, what was occurring.  1) Keee- Grrrr: Around 2002, my brother suggested trying out a new location further down river than we normally hunt. He ran me down the river in the boat and dropped me off next to a slough, then went back upriver to go in the woods himself. This was for an afternoon hunt, so heading in the woods around 2 pm. I walked about 250 yards away from the river (east) along the bank of the slough until it started to curve upriver, then found an oak to climb with my tree stand. As I sat there, I started to notice that there was nothing going on in the swamp. Normally, there is a lot of background noise and movement- squirrels, birds, insects. The only time that stops is when a predator moves through or a major weather shift is about to occur- but this silence just kept on. I then started to hear something between me and the river, slightly downstream of me, that sounded like squabbling racoons but quieter. Nothing else happened all afternoon- it was just slightly off putting- the definition of ‘oppressive silence’. It started to get dark and I decided that I was going to get out of there a few minutes early. Got down and started assembling my gear (lash the stand together, get out the head lamp and flashlight, etc) as the sun was setting. Got my stand on my back and took a few steps toward the river when, between me and the river, there was a call I have never heard before or since: Keee. Sharp, loud, piercing. For some reason, all I could think was “That’s a four foot tall parrot”. It was immediately followed by a growl: Grrrrrr. Big. Deep. Volume. I can’t put enough r’s on that Grrrr to emphasize what that growl sounded like, or how long it rolled on for. My brain immediately went “Followed by a 800 lb tiger”- and then realized; oh, shit, that’s between me and the river- where I need to go. By now it’s dark. A deer went by me at a fast walk- I hear rapid hoofsteps, maybe 15 yards away. A few seconds later, and Keeee. Grrrrr. Closer. I hear no steps, wings, branches- nothing. But that call was about half the distance between me and the river. I’m still standing there, frozen. A third call, closer still. By now, I’m well past freaked out. I turn on the flashlight, headlamp, jack a round into the rifle (lever action) and sort-of squeak out “Hey”. I’m not proud of that “Hey”- I would like to think I could have responded to that call with a throaty “Don’t mess with me- I’m a bad MF’er” , but no, I was pretty well puckered up and all my 6’2”, 220 lbs could muster was a weak “Hey”.  I’m sweeping the woods with the flashlight and headlamp, with the rifle now loaded and safety off- and: nothing. I see nothing, hear nothing, nothing moves- and in a few minutes, I hear the boat coming downriver and see the spotlight. As soon as I saw that, I start to hustle down the slough bank talking loudly. Got to the river bank, jumped in the boat, and told my brother to get the hell out of Dodge. I told my brother and the other two folks we were hunting with- and the consensus was, yep, strange things happen in the woods, and we don’t much talk about it. 2)	Palmetto bed.  Maybe five years later. After a morning hunt, my brother and I meet up in the woods on our way back to camp for lunch. On our way we passed near a saw palmetto clump. At this time of day, the animals (deer and hogs) have bedded down. These palmetto clumps are prime bedding sites- they are higher and dryer than most of the swamp around them, and great cover. So, what we do is split up- one person works wide around the outside of the clump, while the second waits a few minutes and then quietly works through the clump. Idea is that an animal would normally hold in the clump to let you go by, but will ease out if someone is coming in- and the forward person might get a shot at them. So my brother goes in as I’m waiting outside- and in a few minutes, I hear- “Um, Mike- come in here”. I work my way in, and he’s standing looking at a 6’ X 10’ space in the middle of the clump tiled with broken off saw palmetto fronds. Green, freshly broken off, evenly distributed to make a nice ground cover. I looked at them to verify that they were snapped off- no bite marks, no tool marks. There were maybe 60 to 80 fronds, one layer deep, nicely spread to cover the entire area. I saw no hair, there was no smell- just a bed of palmetto fronds laid out nicely in the middle of the clump. Now, it only takes 10 to 15 lbs of pressure to break off a palmetto frond, but you need opposable thumbs. I looked at my brother, he looked at me; we didn’t say one word- just walked out of there and went back to the boat. Not discussed at all. A few years later he texted me to say he had “found another one of those beds” in a different WMA.","Ochlockonee river bottom, downriver of Telogia Creek.

I was kayaking with a friend in econlockhatchie river in orange county the east side of orlando fl it was 2003 early spring or very late winter my friend was much slower than me so I was having fun suprising these very large alligators that were sunning them selves in the early morning sun.The river is very narrow and has tight winding corners which allowed me to pop around a corner and to my delight most of the time a huge gator would slip into the river silently I would glide over the spot thinking that gator has to be lurking on the bottom.Anyway The wind was light out the west very dry and cool a real treat for a floridian I paddled a ways on a strait with the wind blowing from the woods to the water when I smelled such a strong overwhelming oder musty thick moist pugent smell I never experienced before I looked to see what on eart could it be when I saw big patch of long flowing fur it was shiny and light brown and moving fast then this animal crashed through the woods with so much force that small trees were popping and snapping as it ran away from me and the river then that smell was lingreing over the area and was so strong I finnaly held my breath and had paddle to get some fresh air.I had heard that bigfoot smelled like that but I had no idea they had been reported in fl.Anyway I had watched monster quest for years and not one person ever mentioned the smell I only remember it from seventies on tv when i was very young I never reported this til now because I felt  stupid and confused then after watching tonights episode where 2 different reports described that same smell I felt compelled also the location seemed very odd orlando fl just seemed too odd but internet searches showed many reports,ecolockhatchie river off st rd 50 between 2 spots where we drop the kayaks then drive 2 cars then drive back so we can float down stream and drive back so we dont have to paddle up stream then float back to the same spot where we parked the car get to see more of the river,Orange County,Florida,Spring,Report 25577: Kayaker smells a terrible odor and then sees a hair-covered figure on the Econlockhatchee River,28.48106,-81.11927,3/15/2003,25577,Class B,djn640ff0n,79.93,71.5,63.07,65.06,0.83,0.71,0.4,0.0008,1,rain,1013.72,Foggy overnight.,6,6.83,32,2.47
"I moved to a small, rurual area outside of Orlando, FL (from Missouri)just a few months ago and I'm still learning my way around the area.  Subsequently, my wife and I often drive around on the weekends to get better familiar with our new home town. Today, (Saturday Sept 2, 2006) we struck off to go to a shopping mall called Waterford Lakes and it was en route to the mall that I saw something peculiar. My wife was driving today, so I was relaxing looking out the passenger side window at the various swampy patches that are so common in central Florida and I must confess that I'm always looking for wildlife. My wife teases me because she knows that I'm primarily looking for aligators and thinks that it is such a ""tourist thing"" to be doing. However, on a couple of occassions I've actually spotted aligators sunning themselves, as well as numerous deer and turkey, so I feel justifed enough to keep looking. Well, we were traveling south on the Florida Turnpike and just saw a sign for the Ocoee exit when off to my right I saw a man walking in a very swampy & rugged section of meadow about a hundred yards to the right of the turnpike. As he was going in the same direction as we were heading, I was able to watch him for about 5 to 10 seconds and really didn't think too much about him other than he was pretty gutsy to walk in that area all by himself, considering that he seemed to walk with an odd gait. Another strange thing was that he seemed to be dressed in all brown from the head down to his knees (the tall grass covered his lower legs, so I can't say if this guy was wearing shoes or socks). Please note, this took place at about noon, on a very clear Florida day and I believe that the temp was about 93 degrees, so seeing a guy walking around such an area without a hat, or short sleeved shirt is unusual. Well, by this time we passed the fellow and I kept looking off to the right to see where he might ultimately be headed, but for the next few miles all I saw was more swamp and grass. As I stated, my wife was driving and didn't see the man, but I was talking with her about it as it happened and she asked me a few questions (she thought he was probably homeless). When I started describing the man to her, I started to question whether or not the ""fellow"" I saw was necessarily human.  For example, either his hair was very, very bushy, or this guy didn't have much of a neck.  Actually, his head looked a little pointed. He must have been fairly big, because I could clearly see him even at 100 yards distance, yet try as I might, I couldn't identify a single article of clothing on him. Finally, I couldn't even confirm his skin color, because I literally only saw dark brown over his entire body, including his hands. I must confess, I'd be thrilled to think I might have seen a bigfoot, but I just don't know because my first thought was that this is just some poor idiot who was going to pass out from the heat in the wilderness.  But on reflection, I think could be wrong. One thing I can say for sure is that he didn't seem frightening or monsterous in anyway.  I would imagine a bigfoot encounter to be much more exciting than this.  However, I was at a very safe distance and in a moving auto, so I might feel differently if I met him on foot.  Any thoughts?

I was sitting in the back of the car, we were talking and I just happened to glance over to the right to look at the river when I saw a brown upright figure just walking away from the water's edge. Even though it was a distance away, I could see that it was one color from head to toe and the whole body was evenly shapped like an animal in the distance rather than a person wearing clothing. As I saw it take those couple of steps I could see the arms swing with the motion of the legs.

"Aug. 26 2011 This day was a Friday in August, Central Florida. In the pre-dawn hours of the morning my husband was not even half way on his commute from Space Coast to Disney World to report for his early morning shift, like he does 5 days a week.  He takes the 192 which involves a loooong stretch of road with seemingly no sign of life anywhere for about an hour until you reach the St. Cloud area.  My husband slammed on the brakes to try to avoid what was in the road without hitting it dead on, all the while trying to avoid flipping his Volkswagon Passat. Unfortunately, he could not avoid contact, and he struck the massive 9 Ft. Gator. He pulled the car over after attempting to resume driving, realizing the car was now undriveble. He made phone calls to the insurance company, his job, and me. I head out on the same stretch of 192 to retrieve him.  His vehicle is being loaded onto a flatbed and he is waiting with the tow truck driver who is nice enough not to leave him standing at the side of the road in the middle of nowhere at (now) 6 o'clock in the morning. I am driving, wide awake, looking the whole time for this piece of road kill.  I want a photo of it. No I am not morbid, but he said it was HUGE, and I take pictures of all wild animals I come across. Bunnies, snakes, gators, whatever.  I drive a long time, the sun is breaking over the line at the moment I finally come to the Gator.   It is daylight enough that I can drive without headlights and I can see outside very well. I see it up ahead in the distance, I see the Turkey Vultures. The BIG BLACK birds that come to eat the road kill.  My eyes are darting down to the road, up ahead the highway looking for the tow truck, back to the monstrous mess in the road.  I am slowing down so I can photograph the Gator, and I am reaching for my camera.  As my eyes follow a 3-pack of the large birds up off the road and cross over the the right, I see a man walk into the woods up ahead. He is up ahead a distance I would call a block. A block away.  He is wearing ALL BLACK.  His elbows are bent as he is walking,  and he disappears into the woods. So I am pulling over now, snapping photos of the disgusting mound that is so large in the road that if it's not cleaned up, and if someone hits that, there is going to be another accident. And I am fully awake and present in the moment.  I am running a checklist in my head.  Gator. Birds. Man. Man ?!?!  What Man? Why would a ""man"" be out here at (now) 7am exactly, walking around in the woods. There are cows here.  Lots of land you pass on this road has cattle being  raised for beef. Oh, and a DEER sign. A sign, just a moment back I passed , warning of Deer Crossing. (Thanks for the heads up on the 9 Ft. Gators).  So he's tending to his cows?  A ranch hand? Where's his truck? Where's his Cowboy hat? . So I recall this again.  A man - in ALL black- no change of color for face or hands- Wearing a black hoodie? On a beautiful, warm, dry, summer morning- in August- in Central Florida? He's not  looking  when  a car pulls up? He  walks into the woods that are headed nowhere?  I don't think so.  Makes no sense.  I think I saw a Bigfoot. So it took me about 2 minutes to put this all together and I didn't want to leave!  I wanted to go in after him.  I couldn't. My husband was waiting and was all revved up from his climactic morning.  He would be angry if I delayed, goofing off. The tow truck driver had waited long enough. I snapped like 2 pictures of the mess in the road and quickly moved on. Putting this all together in the months since the event, it makes more and more sense that what I saw was a Florida Skunk Ape.  Of course he would be pulled out of the woods at the knowing of the HUGE road kill.  It was dark for more than an hour while that Gator sat there in the dark. There was time for a Bigfoot to hoof it on out there and check out the scene, hey, he even had enough time to pack a bag lunch. Nearly escaping unnoticed before the sun came up over the horizon. It has been almost a year, and I am planning to go back to said location and search for prints and evidence one day. I have driven by the exact location approximately 6 times since then. Each time going over and over it in my head.  I am so angry with myself that I had camera in hand, and came up empty.  But even driving in the passenger side with the camera hanging out of the window I can miss a pic of a deer!  Nothing could have prepared me to photograph a ""hey--maybe that's a ""somethin'  "" at a moment's notice.  Meanwhile, since my incident I have heard of two other sightings in locations that are within 2 hours driving distance (east or south) of my incident.  I continue to search for new reports of local sightings and hope to make future trips to search for tracks.

"A friend and I had towed my canoe from Okeechobee to Lake Park to paddle the water catchment area EQQ. It was early morning before 8AM. We were told we had to rent a canoe and couldn't go out by ourselves, had to go one a guided trip. I grew up in the area and had covered on foot, horse, swamp buggy, canoe, etc. But they ranger still wouldn't let us go. So we walked the boardwalk and I looked out to the cypress heads and squatting down at the base of a cypress tree was a dark figure. It would dig a little in the mud at the base of the tree and stand up and put a hand to it's mouth. I asked a Ranger for binoculars and she came out to look. The humidity was so high the binoculars fogged over and were useless. We watched the figure squat down and repeat, dig around, stand up and it did it over and over. Another Ranger came and my friend and I watched this motion for about five to seven minutes more then left. I have no idea how long the rangers watched it or if they saw it leave. If it turned out to be a bear that would thrill me too. No bears had been seen in Palm Beach County since 1979. But I'm sure it wasn't a bear. It stood too straight and bent at the waist and squatted at the knees like a human. A Bear doesn't bend the waist. I had forgotten about it until after I had a sighting in Okeechobee Co. I filed a report on the Okeechobee sighting and spoke with and went out to the area with an investigator. I've decided to report the first sighting because of the way Fish and Wildlife handled a sighting here in Columbia County, Fl where I now live. Big joke, lots of laughs. I take offense to that attitude. I've spent a life time in the swamps and woodlands of Florida, put in 12 years as a wildlife rehabilitator in Palm Beach County. It's pretty safe to say I know what I'm looking at. My friend and I talked about the sighting in 2006 and she said if that's what I thought we saw she was happy with it because she didn't know what it was either. I should mention she is a Veterinarian nurse, pretty familiar with animals too. Since the second sighting I've been putting a lot of research into the subject and would like to discuss ideas with other people but haven't found anyone to carry on a serious conversation with. Since the Finding Bigfoot program came on air and as more information comes out I hope to get past the jokers.

"About 26 or 27 years ago when I was about 9 or 10 at the time and my sister was either 7 or 8, but we both remember exactly what we saw.  We shared a bedroom in the mobile home that we lived in.  The bedroom window was only about a foot wide and a foot tall and was only about one foot from the ceiling.  One summer night we both woke up with a feeling like something was watching us, and when we looked at the window we both saw a dark figure looking down at us through the window.  the thing that got us both was the red eyes that almost glowed in the dark.  We were so scared that neither of us moved a muscle until whatever it was left.  a couple of weeks later, my mother and I were sitting in the living room watching tv late at night when all of a sudden we both heard a loud bang and the mobile home shook.  the next day when we went outside to look, the middle of the back door had a fist print in it about half way up the door and it was bent in a little.  (it was a metal door.)  and there were big bare foot prints under the door.  the mobile home sat about three feet off the ground at that time, so the bedroom window alone had to be at least 8 feet from the ground. the last thing was in either December or January that winter, my sister and I were waiting at the bus stop to go to school, when we heard something in the palmetto bushes behind us.  We both turned around and saw a dark figure moving the palmetto bushes aside with it's hand to look at us, then duck back down behind the bushes.  it did that for about 10 minutes or so until more kids started showing up at the bus stop, then we didn't see it again.  Neither of us were brave enough at that time to go see what it was.","about 40 miles east of Pasco county, and about 5 miles south of Hernando county.

And I supposed I surprised it as it appeared to be just making its way walking out of the tree line towards the road and thats were I saw him, he stopped instantly when my light hit him (I saw him instantly, as well I slowed down)he backed up into the tree line more and just watched me in a seemingly very curious manner. at that point I had been stopped and due to the angle of my lights not being directly on him anymore, just the peripheral of my lights were on him, all I could see was from his shoulders up. I was speechless and for some reason I called out saying ""Hi!"" and at that point he backed up out of the light and I could hear running off into the woods.

"It started last year when it was cool enough to sit around a fire. My husband, I and some nieghbors heard a growl or deep groan that we had never heard before coming from the woods behind our properties. The next night it was late. My husband and I were sitting around the fire and we heard what sounded like something large running and knocking down trees. My husband said, ""That was no hog or deer. They dont sound ike that."" We ran inside the house as it got closer to us. Later that week I heard our dog whinning and barking. I looked out the back door window and I saw it. It was standing at the fence line looking in the back yard towards the fire. It was the biggest scarriest thing I've ever seen.

"I have not had a sighting of him yet but I do have a picture of a foot print and we have heard howls and knocks. I have been hesitant to contact you over the little stuff but tonight took the cake. It was about 6:30 PM and my husband and I were getting ready to grill some meatloaf.  My husband asked me if I had put corn out for the deer and hog.  I told him ""no, why dont you go ahead and do it now"".  He went to the shed and as he came out we smelt the worst of smells. It was like something was dead like a swamp rat. He asked me do you smell that, I was like oh my God yes, it stinks really bad.  He told me go get my gun. I ran in the house and got the 38 special that we keep.  I brought the gun to him.  I went in the house to get my shoes and by the time I came back out there were three large knocks or bangs on the side of the shed.  He dropped the corn and turned toward the shed and trees and backed out of the area really fast.  He said, ""Steph, you know I dont scare eaily, but that scared me so bad it made my hair stand up on ends.""  Well we looked around and didnt see anything but we didnt go behind the shed because it is wooded against it. He left to go to the store and it wasnt even 5 minutes he was gone that my oldest son and I heard sounds over the tv set. I muted it and you could hear it plain as day.  It sounded as if it was shuffling along in the gravel or something and breathing funny.  Then eventually all you could hear were the branches breaking. I had been wondering why the hog and deer hadnt been coming in, would that be the case? My son, I and my dad prior to all of this had been sitting outside enjoying the cool night when we heard noises. We quit talking and listened. It was faint howls and knocks. This lasted from about 8 to 11 Pm. Also, there have been a few other incidents of smells and sights here.  My dad was staying here for a few months and he went to walk his dog like any other night.  Well Zeus wouldnt go, so he dragged him.  No sooner he got around back of the camper trailer he said he saw him.  He said Zeus bout ripped his arm off trying to get back into the trailer. Another time my 2-year-old was playing just off of the steps. I was inside sitting in my chair so that I could see him.  When all of a sudden he screamed at the top of his lungs and about killed hisself trying to run up the steps and get into the house. On the way up all he kept screaming is monster.  He knows the difference a deer and a hog, after all he sees them all the time.  To this day you cannot get him to go off the porch by hisself and he afraid of the fence line.

"I was hiking by myself on the Florida Trail near Florahome. I walked south from the Trailhead near Coral Farms about 7:00. It had rained the day before amd the red clay/sand jeep road had no animal or human prints. All washed away.

I started heading back the way I had come and within 200 yards of the table were some bare foot prints that appeared human. I thought that that was very strange as I had seen nor heard any people around at all plus I was wondering why someone was walking around barefoot. That's when I noticed the prints were huge.

I had the feeling that it knew I was there and was watching me as I glanced apprehensively in the direction it had walked off the trail. It gave a yelp, half dog/half human (acknowleging that I had seen his prints and knew he was there) and then I felt it was gone. I hurried back to my truck with no further incident.

"I am 51 years old, and have trapped, hunted, fished, and camped all my life. I was scouting for deer sign in the fall on a swampy island that I can only reach by using chest waders.  It was cold, clear early afternoon, and as I walked along near the edge of the island, things got very quiet and I stopped all of a sudden--why I don't know--and I heard what started out as an owl hooting but ended with a monkey type sound. Sort of: ""whooo-whooo-whooo-oo-oo-ahh-ahh"". I only heard it once--and got the distinct feeling that another presence was in the woods beside myself.

"Hello, I just found ur web site, have 2 reports. NO B.S.                   This occured in North Port, Florida in 1999, in the summer. My wife & i were sleeping & about 2am we both woke up and heard something outside are window. We were living at the time on the backside of Myakka State Park. This area of Myakka State Park is very desolate, very isolated.

Well anyway when we woke up and heard something out are widow, we had a very strong odor of something coming thru are window. My wife & i looked at each other with looks on are face ,with wonder, we both said at the same time, what the hell is out there, right as we said that this thing shreeked almost human sounding, but a real wild shreking...I was going to send our lab & pit bull after it but we couldn't get them out of our room,& they had never been scared of anything.Then I went to check on are little girl,she slept thru this.

"My husband and I were driving home on I-75, the day after Christmas. Our car just started to accelerate after being in traffic for over an hour due to an accident. My husband was watching the cars closely and I was observing the environment on my left side, as I normally do on a road trip. I looked over to my right and saw something large and black about a football field distance away. At first it looked like it wasn't moving, but I kept watching and after a few seconds I saw an arm extend and it move forward towards the woods. My first instinct was to think it was a bear, but then as I continued to fixate on the animal, I realized it had very long black hair and was extremely broad in the shoulder/lat area. I continued to watch it move forward  very slowly and realized it was in a crouched position but looked as flat and large as the top of a car, from my view. The whole experience was very surreal to me and I think I'm still in shock. The whole length of my viewing time was approximately 5-7 seconds.","Headed N on I-75, right side, between exit #179 and #191.",Sarasota County,Florida,Winter,Report 39014: Passenger on I-75 spots a large animal near Myakka State Park,27.10589,-82.30699,12/25/2012,39014,Class B,dhv6pn3zk0,76.17,68.63,61.09,57.27,0.8,0.01,0.42,0,0,,1015.13,Mostly cloudy overnight.,4,10,144,2.5
"Camping by a lake with family. Step brother took me to go get firewood from a clearing. The clearing was about 50 feet in diameter. Firewood was stacked outside the perimeter. I was about 14 years old at the time. My step brother was telling me how he would protect me if we came in contact with a bear. I was kinda frightened camping and being alone in the dark so he told me that to comfort me. Well when we arrived to the clearing we split up to get firewood. So I walked to the very outer rim and bent down to pick up a piece of wood. At first I heard a growl like a bear... I was stunned. I immediately looked for my step brother to tell him to knock it off. He looked at me and said I didn't do anything what are you talking about. As soon as he said that to my left in the dense tree brush I saw out of the corner of my eye a tall dark figure stand up about 8-9 feet tall (approximation but it was huge). It then grabbed two nearby small trees and began to shake them and my eyes lit up. My brother ran over to see what was happening and then took one look and bolted off to the other side back to camp leaving me. I ran to him screaming and I guess he felt bad doubled back to pick me up and then ran back to the campsite. This is important to note that it was not an alligator or a bear or anything I can identify that can reach that height standing like a person.

"On Monday, June 30, 2008, between 5:00 a.m. and 5:15 a.m., I had the experience of hearing a chilling and unexplained sound.  I was taking numerous boxes and garbage bags from the garage to the end of my driveway at the street for trash pickup.  I had made approximately 6 trips back and forth when, after laying a box down at the curb, I heard something that made me stop in my tracks.  I experienced what I first thought was the start of a loud siren, a loud and ascending WHOOOOO…, coming from across the street.  The sound came from a tree line about 200 feet away at the edge of Horseshoe Lake.  There are empty grated lots directly across the street from my house (about 125 feet deep) and then approximately another 25 feet or more of dense palmetto scrub and primarily pines and loblolly bay trees down to the lake shore.  The sound continued to ascend in pitch and when the pitch didn’t change like that of a siren and I realized that a siren would not be coming from that direction, but rather from the highway behind our house, I felt somewhat panicked.  The sound ended in a booming –OOP.  The entire whoop was long in duration and went from a low to high pitch.  It seemed to be aimed directly towards me and was extremely far carrying in tone.  I immediately felt the hair on the back of my neck stand up.  When my brain could not place the sound with any animal or bird that I am familiar with, I became very frightened at thinking that a man was watching me and calling out.  I started to take some steps backward towards the garage in anticipation that I would see something moving towards me across the empty lot.  Within seconds of the WHOOP, an owl called out with a common hooting from the top of a tree in that same area, as if it had been startled.  The owl’s voice was very distinct from the other sound in the loudness and the way it carried, as well as the elevation of the source of the sound.  I went back into the garage and waited for about 5 minutes there to listen for any other sounds, but only heard the frogs that are common at that time.  Although still dark, there were clear skies at the time, and I could see the silhouette of the tree line.  My side of the street was dimly lit by the lights in the garage and street lights a short distance away.  I go out at this time every morning to haul trash and to take my dog for a quick walk out to the mailbox, and I am used to hearing numerous types of frogs, owls, and whippoorwills. As I stood there, logic told me that even a large man could not have made the resonating sound that I heard from that distance away. Over the next few days, I told my family members what I had heard and asked if they knew of an animal or bird that made such a sound, but they didn’t.  The sound I heard was so unusual, that I couldn’t dismiss it.  I felt the need to keep trying to satisfy the mystery of the sound by placing a native bird or animal to it.  I read every voice description of Florida bird species entries in my North American bird book, paying closed attention to all owls, loons, cranes, egrets, herons and hawks, that I thought may be large enough to have such a bellowing voice.  None of the voices were described as “whoops.”  I then went online and searched for “bird sound whoop” and “animal sound whoop.”  I spent quite a bit of time on National Geographic’s website listening to voice recordings of numerous birds from this area as well as bobcats, coyotes, foxes, etc.  Nothing seemed to match.  I then started to notice the many links to the BFRO website as well as a link to a video of our local Channel 13 newscast of an expedition that BFRO had in the Tampa area about a year ago.  When I played the news clip, and heard one of the female researchers make a call out like a whoop, I almost felt relieved, like I knew in my heart that I was on the right track.  The sound I heard was very similar to the call she made, although the whoop I heard was of a longer duration.  After seeing the news clip, I felt more comfortable about researching the information on the BRFO website.  I came across the sound recordings, and after listening to several, I became convinced that what I heard matched more closely to some of the Skunk Ape recordings than to any other animal or bird known in this area.  I decided to call your organization to discuss what I had experienced. Below are the most similar recordings I found on the website as compared to the sound that I heard: 1974 Whoops and Knocks from California (although I heard only one “whoop” and it was of longer duration) The “Florida Howl” and the 1994 Moaning Howl from Columbiana County, Ohio (the howls in this clip start off like the siren-like beginning of the whoop I heard, but these then descend in pitch as opposed to the one I heard which continued to ascend until ending in a –OOP)",Exact location omitted,Seminole County,Florida,Summer,Report 24134: Homeowner hears possible howls east of Winter Springs,28.63434,-81.14076,6/30/2008,24134,Class B,djn6csep57,92.12,81.66,71.2,71.15,0.78,0.43,0.91,0.0071,0.52,rain,1018.97,Rain in the evening.,10,9.78,225,1.32
"This happened tonight. I had gone outside on the porch to have a cigarette about 9:00 pm and my two German Sherpards went out with me. I was outside about 2 -3 mins. when less then 100 feet from me just at the woods edge I heard a very loud yell/scream. My two dogs immediately jumped off the porch and took off towards the sound and I ran inside to get a shotgun and light. The dogs where running around sniffing the ground frantically but staying in the yard and not going into the wood. With my flashlight in one hand and gun in the other I went out into the yard and was looking around for a clue as to what could have made such a weird loud noise. Even though we live in the country we do have a few houses around us and the only thing that I could come up with is that it had to be some kid messing around and at that time I became mad and yelled "" you might think messing around here playing games is fun but I'll tell you I have a gun and someone could very well get hurt messing around like this in the dark"". I had barely gotten the words out of my mouth when I would say about 25 yards into the woods came the scream again. The dogs dashed into the woods and even though they normally obey me very well, all of the yelling would not get them to return to the yard for about 5 mins. Two things stand out as very odd about what happened tonight. One is that it was right in my yard, granted it was at the edge but it was in the yard none the less. It made such a loud yell as though it wanted me to know that it was there! The other thing I find strange is that the dogs never once barked or growled. You would have to know my dogs to understand how strange that is. They are very protective of the yard. They will bark at a leaf blowing though, and if anyone comes up the drive, watch out! They love to hear themselves bark. They did not bark once, they just kept running around as though they had gone nuts. My wife was in the living room and heard it.  It was loud enough to hear it with the windows closed and the TV on. I am 45 years old, have hunted and camped a good part of my life, spending a lot of hours outdoors and I have never heard anything even close to what I heard tonight.

"Last year my brother and I were hog hunting in the Guana River WMA in St Johns County, FL.  There was a lot of activity in the woods that day as this place gets crowded during hog hunts.  We were the last hunters to leave and we were talking to the check station attendant (biologist).  It was about an hour after dark and it was starting to get cold.  There was only a propane heater and latern running at the check station.  The Game Wardens had cleared the WMA of all vehicles, so we know that we were the only ones left in the area. To get into the WMA, you must drive through a wooded portion of a state park (no hunting allowed).  The check station is about 300 yards past the entrance gate. As we were getting ready to leave, we heard a very loud screaming (several screams over a 6-7 second period) about 75 to 100 yards behind the check station back towards a marshy area that borders the state park and WMA.  These screams were high pitched and very powerful, and they seemed to go right through you.  It sounded as though there was someone getting attacked by something.  It made the hair on the back of our necks stand up.  The air was very calm and cool.  We could also hear the faint sound of something in the woods moving palmettos and bushes (lasted about 3 or 4 seconds). At first we thought it might have been a bird in the marsh, but this sound was way too loud and the even though it was high pitched, it was very dynamic as though a very large animal had made it.  The sound was closer than the marsh, and we heard the noises of something moving in the woods.  It sounded very similar to some the recorded sounds I have heard on this site.  We asked the biologist what he thought it was and he did not know.  For several minutes we pondered the idea that it was a bobcat/panther, hog, bird, of some sort of small game getting attacked such as a rabbit squeel, but we all concurred that it was none of those.  My brother and I have been hunting/camping all of our lives and know different animal sounds.  It freaked us out pretty bad and we left after hearing this.  I was especially freaked out by the response of the biologist who did not stick around. Normally I would have just ignored this incident and passed it off as some animal as mentioned before, but I know that it was not.  It also brought back the memory of a very similar sound we heard years ago (84-86?) in Pennsylvania while camping on a vaction trip (rural area of Lancaster County).  It was just after dark as we returned back to our camper (grandparents motorhome) from the camp ground fishing pond.  As we arrived, we heard the same type of sound off in the distance.  It scared us to death and we did not leave the camper all night. We urged our grandparents to travel to our next camp ground the next day. I have heard other stories of sightings and sounds from very credible witnesses.  This incident makes me a believer, and I will never walk in the woods feeling the same again.",Guana River WMA which is several miles North of St. Augustine off A1A (Guana River Dam State Park).

"My son and I were out fishing one night in July of 2011 at about 1am on friday night at the Matanza bridge back waters, this is on A1A in Florida. at about 2:00 am, we heard this really weird sound of howling and grunts so we sat there for about 25 minutes or so and the sound kept getting louder and closer to where we were parked. My son said to me dad did you see that, I said what and he said something really big was approaching where we were parked sitting in the car. So he winded up the window and said we better leave, so i said no just wait a little bit longer and lets see if it will come back. after about another 10 minutes or so the howling began again but this time it seemed to be more than one howl, as if there was a reply to the deeper howl.

"I live in Suwannee County 3mi from the intersection of I75 and I10. If you drew a line through the 2 Suwannee Co. sightings you show on this site, the line would go thru my house. A creek that feeds Rocky Creek, which is the creek featured in the Wellborn sighting runs 250 yards from my front door. Beavers have dammed it up and now there is a huge swamp as a result. I was walking near the swamp 3 days ago and found a footprint that measured 16in long. Conveniently the only camera i have is broken. Last night I heard a vocalization that would make your blood run cold. It was very similar to vacalizations on your site, though much loger in duration and higher pitched. It was followed by three thumps that sounded like wood being knocked together. I had a broken shovel handle in my flowerbed, and i responded by knoking the same pattern. It respoded with three more knocks. 30 seconds later i heard a similar vocalization much further away and lower pitched. im still freaking out.","get off I-75 @ 136 Live Oak/ White Springs, that general vacinity...",Suwannee County,Florida,Winter,"Report 21979: Rural resident hears knocks, howls & finds a footprint near Wellborn",30.31709,-82.8436,11/10/2007,21979,Class B,djmh6z51u5,74.06,59.05,44.04,45.57,0.72,,0.03,0,0,,,Clear throughout the day.,0,,299,1.45
"I was out behind my house smoking, walking my dogs around 6:30 pm, just before dark. My back yard is grass for about 100 yards then it is medium to heavy woods (about 4 acres total). My dogs just froze in place looking towards the woods. I was asking them whats wrong, what do you see? They stayed still, gazing into the woods for about a minute. I also looked towards the woods but saw nothing but trees and I could make out a large tree stump, then they both ran from me back into the house through a the doggy door on the North side of my house. When looking towards the woods they are to the East of me. I kept staring at the woods looking side to side while still seeing nothing. My cigarette was done, I tossed it onto the ground and went to step on it when I noticed some movement about 20 yards in the woods. It was towards the tree stump...I watched as this stump, which was about 3 to 4 foot tall stand up and double its size... I was in shock, it seemed like it was not real. I stayed motionless while watching this thing, which clearly was NO tree stump start to walk deeper into the woods, heavy steps each time it walked, it was between 7' or 8 feet tall, had hair/fur covering it. The way I could tell this is because it was walking in a zig zag motion, purposely I guess to try and hide from me behind trees. The sun would only shine in spots through the top of the trees and I could see the hair/fur shine maybe every 5 seconds or so/ This thing made noise/sound only twice from itself, once when it first rose up, I interpreted it as a ""Damn now I have to move"" moan/grunt... second when he/she looked at me right before it got to the gas line road (which is a dirt, right of way road for the gas company) almost to tell me, you stay where you are, don't follow me and I had no plans on that.... I went back out the next day, dogs refused to go with me, to see if there was something it was doing in the woods and found nothing. Also went to the dirt road looking for prints but found only a part of one because of deer and other animals walking over them. I believe this thing, and others follow the deer here for food, the [Suwannee River] State Park has a no Hunting buffer I think that is 5 or 10 miles out from the park. The deer know this and I am sure if these things have been here for a while also know that people don't hunt around here.. I have been away from this house do to selling it but recently purchased it back. Only one of my dogs is still with me and will still not walk in the woods like we used to... This thing had medium to dark reddish/brown hair/fur, when it snarled/growled at me. I saw fingers, no hair on the palms because I could see skin, no facial hair. It did not stink as bad as I read about. It smelled more like wet dog and pine sap..I have been back here about 3 weeks but see no signs of this thing but did hear its growl two nights ago, I was on my front porch that faces west, smoking before going to bed. My dog was laying by my side. What ever it was scared my dog and me also. It sounded like an owl at first but turned into a growl at the end.  Weird...

My wife and I were standing on a boardwalk on a bright, moonlit night around 11:30 p.m.  I was looking north when I first saw it at about 100 yards.

It walked with a smooth, long stride with arms swinging about two feet in front and back.  It was a uniform, solid black or brown (""shadowy"") in color; no light face, hands or shoes.

"BFRO, My friend and I, were 'spotting' gators one night in Ormond Beach, FL when we had an encounter with something, well...unknown. We were near a lake when we heard something large in the woods behind us.  When we shined our lights into the woods to see what was making the noises, we heard a series of blunt beating noises, about a second to two seconds apart.  The sound was like that of a wood baseball bat hitting a tree.  This went on from about 30 seconds to a minute before the tree fell.  As we heard the crackling of the falling tree we ran back towards the nearest safe place to us.  At this same time we heard in the woods to our left, something almost stalking our every move.  Once we got to ""civilization"" and realized we were out of danger, we decided to go back to find out the source of what happened. When we returned, almost an hour later, we found a tree freshly broken in half, the break being about eight feet from the ground.  The break was not a clean cut like that of a hatchet, rather like the tree had been bent to its breaking point.  We knew this was a fresh break from the dripping sap, which next day was dry so it was definitely the source of the noise of a falling tree.  On a branch about seven feet from the ground we found a hair sample.  The hair is still yet to be identified.  The best description we can give is it is a two to two and a half inch light brown hair, which is wavy with a kink close to the middle of it. The tree is about 25 to 30 feet tall.  The break was about seven to eight feet in the air.  At waist, the diameter is about ten inches, and at the break between six and eight inches. Please help us to determine if this was from a known and indigenous species or if it was our distant friend. Also, If there is a credible source to send the hair, to find out its origin, please send us a lab. Thank you. ***A NEW REPORT (37689) OF THIS INCIDENT WAS FILED 11/25/12. THIS IS THE STATEMENT FROM IT. BOTH REPORTS ARE NOW COMBINED. While walking down the dock, the woods next to the dock began moving and shaking violently. We were scared but assuming it could be a bum, we shouted into the woods. Eventually the shaking stopped and a few minutes later, we heard a knocking sound. It sounded like a 4x4 size pieces of wood hitting a tree. The knocking went on for several minutes. We continued to yell trying to figure out what it was. Next, was the scariest part. A tree about 25-30 feet from the dock started rocking violently. Still screaming, the tree fell toward the dock and we started running, the whole time we heard something keeping pace parallel to us on the dock and grunting. We later went back and found a brown/red hair hanging from the bottom of a branch.","From US1 head west on Wilmette.

"On the 19th of May 2007 at around 8:30 AM, My Wife and I were on our way to the local bait shop on the Flagler/Volusia county line in central Florida. Our usual route to this shop at Highbridge Rd. is via Old Dixie Hwy through Walter Boardman also known as ""the loop"". I was turning left off Old Dixie onto Walter Boardman and I looked ahead on the road and saw 2 vehicles approx. 1/2 mile in front of me on Walter Boardman. At that instant behind the vehicle  closest to me I saw a tall, dark figure on 2 legs swiftly cross the road from south to north. The figure that I saw was taller than the vehicle ahead of it and it appeared to cross the road in 3 or 4 stiff-legged strides. I said to my Wife ""did you see that""? She replied that she had not as she was looking for something in her purse, by that time it was already in the woods. I sped up to reach the area where the figure crossed the road, my Wife and I scanned the woods where it had disappeared and saw no trace of it. I knew right away that this was not a regular animal or man because it was extremely tall, dark and fast, although it did not appear to be running, the strides covered a great distance.We continued towards our destination and arrived at Bulow Plantation Ruins, a state park where we fish. We mentioned what I had seen to the Ranger who dismissed it as a black bear. I disagree, it was lean and too fast to be a bear walking on hind legs. I wish that I could have gotten a better look up close but I have and will continue to look carefully as I drive ""the loop"" for another sighting of this very interesting creature.",,Volusia County,Florida,Spring,Report 19232: Motorist spots a tall unknown figure crossing Walter Boardman Loop,29.3396,-81.0834,5/19/2007,19232,Class B,djnqfvhgec,80.07,69.41,58.75,54.36,0.52,0.38,0.11,0,0,,1019.08,Partly cloudy until evening.,10,9.97,38,6.15
"A friend and I were fishing late into the night and early morning in a remote area in between Ormond Beach and Flagler Beach next to a small bridge on Walter Boardman Lane. The friend of mine noticed a set of eyes shining in the woods while looking down a small trail. We were wearing headband style flash lights and he told me to check it out. As I looked down the trail it was very obvious to me that the eyes were far enough apart and high enough off of the ground to justify being concerned. I convinced myself and my friend that whatever it may be, its more afraid of us than we were of it. A while later, maybe 20 minutes or so, he mentioned that it was still there starring at us. I walked slightly closer to the opening of the trail in an attempt to make out what it may have been, but still couldn't tell. A few minutes later, same thing... it was still there and still starring towards us. I tried to make noise and decided to yell at it. It apparently wasn't too concerned b/c it didn't so much as blink or move. We again convinced ourselves that it was nothing to be afraid of. We continued with fishing and not long after my friend noticed that it had finally moved on. We thought nothing more of it until I got the biggest scare of my adult life. As I was standing there, something let out the deepest, slowest growl that I've ever heard in my life. It sounded as though it was standing directly behind me and very close. I turned to look at my friend and the look on his face told me that I was not hearing things. Without a second thought or a spoken word, we dropped our fishing poles and ran as fast as we could to the truck. We jumped in and locked up tight. My first question was if he had heard it and his response was ""yes, what was that?"" We were so scared that we weren't sure what to do. The decision was made a couple of minutes later to start the truck and turn on the headlights. He raced the engine and blew the horn repeatedly. Even after a few minutes of doing this and feeling sure that whatever is was had to have left the area, we were still VERY hesitant to retrieve our fishing gear. After a long while of deciding, we very quickly jumped out, THREW our things into the back of the truck, and left. We had both lived in Florida for some time. We spent a lot of time on the water and in the woods, fishing and camping in remote locations. Never before, NEVER, have I heard anything like it. I can say 100% that it WAS NOT an alligator or a bear. Beyond that I have no idea. I do know that whatever is may have been convinced two grown men, both of them, to immediately go out and purchase handguns to carry during each and every future outing! Not sure where the sound clips of the growls come from on the ""finding Bigfoot"" television series... but they are about the closest thing I've heard to the sound I heard that night. The only other detail that stands out to this day is that we had a ""buffet"" of shrimp, chicken gizzards and livers, and cut up fish sitting on the tailgate of the truck.",It was a small bridge on Walter Boardman Lane.

"Hello. I live in okeechobee co. florida. I am a christian and a family man and this report is as factual as I can make it, as god is my witness. I was not alone when this account occured. here are the details. Me and my hunting buddy were hunting boar with dogs one evening a few sommers back. We were on private land and not allowed to be there wich is why I suppose I never got to see what scared us so bad, I will explain. Me and tim were huntin all nite, mostly letting the dogs run and we just sit and listen for baying and then run to the dogs, catch the pig and release it. well this evening we had just left the treeling bordering a swampy area and were crouching down resting and smoking, Id guess it was 3am. Suddenly as we sat there, we heared what sounded like footsteps. We stood up and looked and listened, they immediately stopped.. we both whispered ""what was that"" to each other fearing a game warden or the owner of the land..then we heared a palm frond move and two distinct steps.We looked at eachother and ran three steps, stopped looked wide eyed, unsure of what we were hearing. then we heared a frond move and three steps and again it stopped. We turned, ran two and stoppped then we noticed it was immitating us, stopping when we did etc and comming closer. again we turned and took a step and it took a step and stopped. Me and tim looked at eachother and ran as fast as we could, we knew it was a game warden or a person, it had to be. we stopped after 200 yards or so and turned and looked there was nothing behind us but along the tree line we had left ( we were now 250yds across the swampy opening across from the tree line) about at 2 O clock position in the distance we coul hear something smashing its way through the undergrowth and breaking everything it touched heading away from us... we would always talk about it and I personally regret running, I had a strong light, I should havetried to get it closer, I think I could have, it was interested and following us. I know it was no animal, was easy to tell because you could hear it clear the path and then take distinct steps.. each step the exact count of our own. that is my story but I would like to add this. Timmy has been dog hunting every nite for 5 or more years  and after this incedent he described a  swtrange encounter where he was with three other people who all saw the same thing... He stated that one nite while hog hunting during a half moon him and the guys were stopped and resting when tim noticed an outline at the bottom of a tree.. all the guys looked and they became concerned and frightned because there was the distinct outline of a huge man sitting at the base of that tree, plainly outlined sitting on his butt, feet streight out in front of it..Tim said it had huge shoulders and was just eanourmous..he said "" We freaked out and ran like hell"" funny thing is it was again private land and at first they thought it was a warden, but after a few mins they had no idea what it was but became extremely afraid of that massive torso sitting at the base of that tree watching them. ( I am beginning to notice there is almost always a tree involved in these sightings) I believe timmy, there is no person I know who has covered more ground in pitch black woods than him and we spent a few together doing it. Honestly it has haunted me since and led me here to study and make an effort of my own to discover this being. That is all I have, take care.

"A friend and I decided to go boating one Saturday morning and went to Scotts landing in Nassau County, Florida on the St Marys River. We rented a boat and headed west up the St Marys River into Georgia.  We traveled west about 15 miles where we went around a bend and our motor must have hit something in the water and shut off.  We drifted to the bank on the Georgia side of the river where we tried to start the boat with no success. This was about 3:30 pm with about 3 hours of light left as it is getting dark about 6pm. There was a fishing camp on the Florida side of the river with no one there so we paddled over to that side where we settled in and built a campfire to spend the night as our phones had no service. We settled by the fire and talked and had a good time. Around 12:30AM we began to hear something moving thru the woods from far off. We could tell it was moving towards us because the breaking branches and snapping twigs and crunching leaves were getting louder. When it got down to the rivers edge across from us we heard grunting and growling as well as stomping on the ground that was extremely loud and a deep base thud. I got up and walked down to the rivers edge and started shining the opposite bank. As I was shining I could hear something moving thru the brush towards me. As it got directly across from me I saw it thru the brush and could see a shoulder and head moving left straight across from me. I could see it moving for about 5 to 6 feet before it came to a tree where it stepped out from behind the tree and looked directly at me. I shined the light in its face and saw two red eyes and a head and right shoulder. When the light hit it in the face it turned its head back to the direction it came from and took off back that way. It seemed mad cuz it started stomping and growling and breaking limbs again. It continued to raise hell for another hour to hour and a half before it went quiet. Of course we did not sleep that night and at the first light we got in the boat and started rowing towards home and made it about 5 miles where we were picked up by the Nassau County police boat and towed another 10 1/2 miles back to Scotts Landing.  It was a truly amazing experience for me, my buddy however didn't agree with me. He said he was frozen with fear and will never return there. I myself would love to return and search for the creature.","I have found the location on google earth, we were at 30degrees 42'18.54"" N 82 degrees 02'16.20""W elevation 11ft",Nassau County,Florida,Winter,Report 39080: Late night sighting by a stranded boater on the St. Marys River,30.71004,-82.0443,12/8/2012,39080,Class A,djmwtn94vn,70.81,65.37,59.93,58.57,0.93,0.92,0.83,0,0,,1017.54,Foggy starting in the evening.,3,4.23,118,0.59

"Me and my friend were planning on camping out in the woods near my uncles house, near an old well where a old house used to be. It was march and it was just starting to warm up around the area and well we setup camp and head back to my uncles house, it was about a three minute ride by four wheeler. We get some food and tell him we are turning in for the night so we head back to the site. It was about 6:30 when we get to the tent. We get a good fire going and talk for an hour or two. we get in the tent at about 8:30 or so. About an hour or so later my friend wakes me and he tells me to listen and it sounded like big thuds and tree limbs breaking. It almost sounded like it was circling the or site. It couldnt have been about 40 or 50 feet away. But the woods are so thick back there we couldnt figure out what it was. It sounded like it was getting closer. My friend was laying in front of the tent opening and sounded like it was 5 ft away. It got quite and we are trimbiling. and then we heard deep grunts almost like a gorilla it was very strange. Then it sounded like it was moving away from us going towards a bottom. There is a creek that runs through there and it sounded like whatever it was it was headed that way. We looked at each other and my friend had tears in his eyes. We never went back to sleep that night and we were to scared to leave.

"It was fall of 2006 - Hunting season and I was in the woods on a farm in Ashville, FL.  I had been in the tree stand approximately 2 hours and not seen any deer.  I have been hunting most of my life and am familiar with the woods, sounds and environment.  Approximately 4:30 pm as the light was fading, I heard two loud, distinct ""cries"" or ""yells"" that I have never heard before or since.  I could tell the general direction and distance was approximately 150 -200 yds in front of me.  As I sat there looking, the wind was blowing at my back so I did not notice any unusual smell, but anything downwind from me may have smelled me.  About 10 minutes later I heard the ""yell"" again.  Possibly a bit closer ~ 125 yds.  I remember a large Oak tree about 50 - 75 yds in front of me.  There was a small sapling (8 - 10 ft tall) next to the large tree, with surrounding grasses about 2-3 ft tall.  About 10 min after the last yell I noticed the sapling being whipped back and forth.  I took special notice due to being on ""alert"" from the noise - and further the sapling was violently shaking side to side - not in a constant direction.  Almost like something grabbed the tree near the base and started to  push / pull creating a whipping effect near the top.  I looked at the tall grasses surrounding the area and they were not blowing in the same manner.  This tree appeared to be moved by something. I thought at first it may have been a squirrel that jumped on the sapling - but it shook for about 30-60 seconds - then stopped, then again for another 30 seconds.  Since I did not see anything, I sat there (somewhat in disbelief) armed with a high powered rifle. After a few minutes I was so un-easy I got down and slowly exited the woods.","A farm very close to 146 & Hwy 221 intersection - Ashville, FL.",Jefferson County,Florida,Fall,Report 26393: Man experiences loud yells and tree-shaking while deer hunting near Ashville,30.59612,-83.649,11/20/2006,26393,Class B,djkw09bem4,53.93,46.74,39.55,33.87,0.66,0.42,0.98,0,0,,1019.97,Mostly cloudy starting in the afternoon.,4,8.75,326,6.22
"My second night on the Florida expedition, I set up my camp in the hot area and had one of the most terrifying nights of my life. For the first two hours after dusk, I was by myself and heard what seemed to be three large animals, breaking branches and knocking on trees all around my camp; they moved in what sounded like a triangular pattern, came between me and my vehicle, which was only 20 yards away, and broke a branch that had to be thicker than my wrist. Later in the evening, we heard a very strange, gurgling sound that sounded like nothing I have ever heard before. All this was followed by a 25 second tree-knocking session that would have amazed anyone who heard it. These sounds had to be made by an animal with opposable thumbs; if they were made by humans, they would have had to have been able to navigate one nasty swamp in pitch black dark with the speed and agility of a cat. The guys that camped at that site the next night had audio recorders and got some. As for me we had one low quality tape recorder that didn't pick up more than the wind.

"The incident that my friend and I experienced was weird but not uncommon. It was a follow-up trip from a BFRO expedition and just lasted the weekend. There were about 12 expeditioners and it was in Central Florida. The first night didn't see much action. The next day which was saturday was when a friend and I decided to check out a location where sightings had previously occurred. We all visited this location before and saw or heard nothing. On this day we drove up to the sight because my friend had not been there. As soon as we got out of our vehicle we heard a loud whack! We both looked at each other and nodded our heads. About 20 seconds later we started to hear rythmic knocks. My friend was quite shocked at what he was hearing. That was when we decided to get out the baseball bat. I told Matt that whatever we heard responded back the same way we did. As this went on I decided to go out and investigate. That was what we were there for so I walked around the area. I saw no tracks or anything around the sandy areas so I decided to go beyond this area into the woods. Matt and I kept radio contact the whole time. Another member of our trip was also monitoring our conversation from a couple of miles away. Once I got into the woods there was alot of fallen leaves on the ground and every time I took a step I made alot of noise. The freaky part is that when I would stop I could distinctly hear something moving about 60 yards in front of me. It sounded bipedal and it's steps were louder than mine. Meanwhile back at the truck, Matt was still hearing knocks. I kept making excuses fot what it could be. There was a slight breeze blowing through so I figured maybe the trees close together were maybe bumping. That excuse went out the window when the knocks turned rythmic. Also the walker I heard made me assume that maybe possibly I was walking onto someones property. My other friend who was listening to our talk stated that the whole area was nothing but woods and eventually I would run into a lake. He knew this because his cabin was only a mile or so away. The walking continued fot about 8 to 10 minutes. After it stopped I decided to book. I thought it unwise for me to wander further into the woods alone. As soon as I got back Matt stated that the knocks had also stopped. The remainder of the trip went pretty dry. We have established our own Florida chapter and will have to follow-up on this sight.",We all expeditioners know it as the sinkhole and it is near FR 445 N.,Lake County,Florida,Spring,Report 14100: Knocks heard in the Ocala National Forest,28.966,-81.649,3/11/2006,14100,Class B,djjuy1150m,83.71,72.105,60.5,61.53,0.71,0.1,0.4,0,0,,1021.69,Clear throughout the day.,8,9.62,133,3.41
"To this day I cannot honestly say this was a sighting or not. I will leave that conclusion to those with more knowledge of Sasquatch behavior to decide. At the time my knowledge of Sasquatch, Bigfoot or the skunk-ape was limited only to what I had seen on t.v. or read in the papers rarely. In fact, I was under the belief that the Patterson tape had been debunked and bigfoot was probably a myth. It was a clear March day and I being off from work decided to take a day hike in Rock Springs State Park. The park is not heavily used I think mainly because its reputation for a healthy black bear population keeps city dwelling day hikers well clear of it. I have hiked many time in bear country and the idea of a bear encounter wasn't a worry. I decided on a loop trail approximately 2 miles in length basically as a warm up then planned on hiking different parts of the area. The woods very basically slash pine and palmetto with clear scrub meadow and shallow swamp areas a little deeper in. A well defined trail led through the palmetto. About 1/2 a mile in I noticed the woods had become very quiet and I began to feel as if I was not alone but being watched. In the middle of the trail I came upon a very large of very fresh scat. It was directly centered in the middle of the trail and the stools were incredibly large and long approximately 3 having lengths of between 9 and 11 inches. This was not bear scat as I have seen piles of that before and never saw continuous lengths of stool such as this. Again feeling that I was not alone I developed the strangest feeling that this was there for me to find and that it was meant as a warning not to go further. The fear I felt became almost irrational but I had no doubt I should turn around and leave this area. I have spent many hours in the woods but had never felt this type of flight or fight feeling. I now know that primates have used scat to mark territory and warn others away. Could this have been a warning left by a primate to me? I honestly don't know.",SR 46 west.

"Hello, I contacted someone from your organization about a year ago regarding my encounter in central Florida back in the middle 80s. I was called away to work and was unable to continue with the call. With that said, I would like to finish sharing my experience. I was working as a fence contractor in central FL during the 80s. We had obtained a job to build 10 feed plots for deer in a remote area off of hwy. 44 near the Blackwater Creek area of the Wekiva River Basin. The acreage is vast and was utilized for big game hunting. Since there was a deadline, we had all of the fence material trucked in and we set up camp at the end of the access road. This allowed us to be onsite until all work was complete. On the second day of our stay, we (myself and a helper) were surveying and clearing a fence line in the early morning hours, it was still misty with little light coming through the trees. There was four of us total working, so we split up into two teams to knock out the 10 plots. While my helper and I were clearing brush we were commenting and joking about an odd odor (skunky/sulfer like) we had been smelling a few minutes before reaching the site of the first plot. As we were pulling a string line, abruptly, a dark, bipedal form stepped into our fence line about 60 yards ahead of us. At first we thought it was one of the installers working with us, but as it moved closer to the clearing you could clearly see it was not a human. It appeared to be mostly covered with orange/brown hair, un-human long arms and an odd shaped head (wide, pointy and large) with a very short neck. Once it stepped out, it seen us as well, and when we shouted out the names of the other workers it quickly vanished into the treeline. We viewed the creature for what seemed to be 60 seconds or so before it bolted off. My helper and I were stunned at what we had seen. We spent a few minutes trying to rationalize it but there was no doubt we witnessed something extraordinary. I was carrying a side arm so we walked up to the clearing but could not see anything through the trees, however we did hear something moving rapidly away from us for a few seconds. That was the first of two encounters. The second encounter happened on the fourth night of our stay. All four of us were at camp which was set up on the bank of Blackwater Creek, about 15 feet from the waters edge. That area of the creek is approximatly 12 feet in width from bank to bank. We had began to cook dinner and were still carrying on conversations about our sighting of a hairy creature two days prior, with the other installers ribbing us saying we must had been drinking on the job and such. There was a cooler that we had tied to a rope and placed in the creek to keep the contents cool. As we were eating a loud splash from across the creek startled everyone. One of the other installers ran down to the creek and found that our cooler was gone, as well as the rope and stick it was tied to. We all walked down to the creek bank but there was no sounds other than the normal water movement. The missing cooler was chalked up to raccoons or an alligator. As we settled back into eating, one of the guys walked away to relieve himself, as he returned to the truck everyone looked at him, he was silent and all the color was gone from his face, he just looked at me and said ""I'm sorry, I will never doubt anything you tell me again, ever"". Not sure what he meant at the time, I asked him what happened, he quietly turned and pointed, saying ""someone or something was standing on the other side of the creek watching me pee"". It was obvious he was actually scared speechless. I grabbed a spotlight and we all walked down to the spot where he was standing. As I was hitting the treeline with the light there was no sight of any movements, eyeshine or anything so I stepped as close to the waters edge as I could. As soon as I turned the light back on and the beam hit the other side of the creek, we heard a loud grunt, almost similar to a pig, I panned to our left and that's when it all happened. A large bipedal, hair covered animal stood up from behind a group of palmetto bushes. It stood fully erect, the light shine of the eyes were almost gold, it reacted to the light hitting its eyes like a person would, by throwing it's forearm up in front of its face, let out a chilling sound (not a grunt, more like a short howl) unlike anything any of us had heard, it then turned and fled, vanishing like before. All of that happened in just seconds and all four of us witnessed it. We immediately packed up our gear, went to a motel and stayed at the motel until the job was finished. Three of us later went to the FL fish and wildlife office and reported what we had seen. It was during that report when I first heard the term ""skunk ape"" or even that there had been other sightings of this type. I can honestly tell you, without any doubt, it was not mistaken identity. I grew up as a hunter and outdoorsman and I know what bears look like and also how they act in the wild, it was not a bear, it was definately a primate of some type. Till this day I am effected by the encounters.","From I95 south take the LPGA BLVD exit near Daytona, turn right, follow to end and turn right onto International Speedway BLVD (17/92), continue on 17/92 into DeLand, Turn left onto 17, turn right onto 44 west, continue on 44 approximatly 10 miles.

"Late at night as my family and I were setting off fireworks, we heard something growl loud enough for all of us to hear. My daughters boyfriend, a policeman said he thought it was a ""bear"" just in the treeline off to our left which was very close. Since we do have black bears, I picked up my grandbaby and we all stepped back as my husband and daughter's boyfriend had a look around. Something crashed away into the woods and was gone. The crazy thing is that the sound was nothing like we had ever heard before and we've been here a long time. I might add that we recently completely fenced the area which makes it even more odd. Accessing the yard would be hard for a bear now. Our dogs did not bark but, we had been setting off fireworks, so, I kind of let them off the hook! This occurred again about a month later in August. I had stepped out on the back porch to get a soda from the refrigerator. I felt the hair on my neck stand up and about that time, I heard the same low growling noise straight in front of me that we had heard in July. Then, I heard rustling and what sounded like someone running into or hitting the side of our wooden shed out back very loudly. I yelled to my husband and ran out behind the shed with a spotlight. I saw nothing, and there was no noise of something running away. The woods are thick there so, someone or something would only have to stand a few feet away to disappear. The dogs finally decided to bark when I yelled at my husband, but then, they are kind of lazy and could have been sleeping. Amazingly enough, they are always manage to be awake long enough to eat.","From Deland, FL go W on SR 44 across the St. Johns River. Take first right on CR 42.

"I want to start out by saying that I have never discussed this with anyone except for one other person. I have not discussed it with my wife, my best friend, or any other person close to me in my life. I was fortunate to have a coworker who had, many years ago, shared a similar personal experience that he had in Utah. He is the only person with whom I have shared my experience. I also want to say that what I am about to describe to you has tormented me for the last several months. I cannot emphasize enough how this encounter has affected me emotionally. Thanks to the encouragement of a fantastic confidant, I am now coming forward to report the incident as a step toward putting it behind me and getting on with my life. I did not ask for this, and had the event been within my control, I would have absolutely chosen not to have the experience. My life was perfectly fine with my previous view of reality, as incomplete and skewed as it may have been. I grew up in a very rural setting, and have always loved the outdoors and being in nature. I love to spend time in the beautiful wetlands and forests of Florida’s vast uninhabited wilderness areas. Monday through Friday, I work as an executive in a very large multinational corporation based in Orlando, FL, and being shut up in an office building throughout the week makes me stir-crazy. My life is a very high-stress environment, with responsibilities that include a multi-million dollar P&L, and oversight of approximately 1,000 employees. My weekends are often spent decompressing in nature through hiking or canoeing, especially in the winter months when the temperature is more comfortable. On the morning of Sunday, January 15th, I was visiting friends in Lake Mack, FL, which is a very small community located in a rural area of Central Florida about 10 miles west of Deland, FL, and about 30 miles from my home. To get to this area, go west on HW 44 out of Deland. Highway 44 will curve south just before the drawbridge that crosses the St. Johns River. The Pier 44 Marina will be on the left and is visible from the drawbridge. Immediately after crossing the drawbridge from Volusia into Lake County, turn right onto County Road 42 and continue west for about four miles. If approaching on the westbound side of the road, the Lake Mack community will be located on the south (left) side of CR 42, and the Ocala National Forest on the north (right). CR 42 traverses the southern edge of the 600 square mile Ocala National Forest. Having never been to Lake Mack prior to the 15th, I had earlier looked at the Google Maps application installed on my Blackberry to get directions. I noticed that the Ocala National Forest was just across the road, and saw that there were several forest service roads that crisscrossed the southern portion of the forest. I decided that after my visit, I would go drive through the forest and possibly do some exploring and hiking. I finished up in Lake Mack about noon and drove west on CR 42 for about 1 mile, and turned right onto Deerhaven Road and proceeded north into the forest. Deerhaven Road is paved for about the first 2 or 3 miles until it turns into National Forest Service Road 420, which to my surprise was a one-lane, very bumpy, unpaved road. Initially, I was very nervous about continuing, but the dirt-road was compacted and my car appeared to handle it with no problems. Feeling a bit more comfortable, I continued deeper into the woods. I drove for what I would estimate to be another 3 miles or so. The road passed through an area that appeared to have been burned in the past by a forest fire, as most of the pines were dead and only a very thick 3 to 5 ft layer of saw palmetto and other scrubby bushes covered the ground. In this area, the visibility was better due to the lack of a forest canopy and I could see the forest line about a mile in the distance. At this point, the road was still good, and so I continued driving until I the road left the burned zone and entered the tree line into a heavily forested area. I would estimate that after about ½ to 1 mile into the forested area, I started to notice an increasing amount of soft sand in the road rather than the hardened more compacted dirt that I had been driving on previously. I got nervous and decided to turn around and go back out of the forest on NFS 420 the same way that I had entered. At that moment I felt the car sink into sand. I quickly steered left up on the side of the road so that I could get turned around. I was able to get the car turned around in the opposite direction, but when I moved forward about a foot, the car sank deep in the sand. I tried for some period of time to get unstuck, but ended up only digging the tires deeper into the sand. It dawned on me what a stupid idea it was to bring a car into the backcountry—lesson learned. So here I was, in one of the wildest and most remote areas in the State of Florida completely stranded and all alone. I decided to try to dig out the wheels. I was down on my knees next to the front driver’s side tire digging the sand with my hands. After a few minutes of this, I stood upright to stretch my back out of the hunched position I had been in. When I stood up, a rock pelted me and a shooting pain went through the inside of my left thigh near the groin area, which caused me to jump back and yelp in pain. Because I was leaning forward against the fender of the car, the rock bounced off my leg and onto the hood of the car, and then slid slowly down the hood and into the sand, which, to my relief, told me that it was not a bullet or snakebite. I immediately looked toward the forest on the other side of the road from where the rock came, and perceived movement in the bushes. At this point, I did not see the creature, but did see movement in the branches and leaves of the shrubs, grasses and saw palmetto. The movement was enough to convince me that someone or something was there, and that it—whatever it was—was the source of the rock. Unsure of what to do, I stood there for about 30 seconds and checked my surroundings, including the road to the east and west, and the forest that was immediately behind me. After I turned back from looking into the trees behind me, I heard movement in the forest behind me. The sound that I heard was the sound of leaves and sticks being crushed on the ground, as if someone took one step and then stopped. The sound appeared to come from about 15 feet in the woods behind me. So now at this point, I had perceived movement in the woods on both sides of the road immediately in front of and behind me. I looked back again into the trees behind me where the noise originated, but saw nothing. At this point, the fear struck me pretty hard. Several things crossed my mind, such as wild hogs, bears and coyotes. But none of those animals obviously, to my knowledge, were capable of throwing rocks. Then the thought crossed my mind that perhaps there were a couple of people who had decided to have a little fun at my expense.  So, I called out into the forest, “Who’s there? This isn’t funny. I need help getting my car out of the sand. Please help me,” and so on. I heard nothing in reply and saw no movement. With the fear mounting and my thoughts turning more toward protection rather than getting my car unstuck, I remembered that I had a can of UDAP in my backpack in the trunk. The previous summer, I had hiked part of the Appalachian Trail in Tennessee and North Carolina and had purchased a couple of cans of UDAP for that trip. I walked around the back of the car, opened the trunk and pulled out my backpack. When I slammed the trunk shut, I again heard movement in the trees on the south side of the road and the location from which the rock had been thrown. I looked to my right and began unzipping the backpack when the creature started to make a hissing sound, though up to this point I still had not visually identified the animal. It was a very loud hissing sound, similar to what you might hear from a feral cat that is being cornered, only much, much louder and deeper. It then started to alternate between a hiss and a vocalization that sounded like “haaaaawwwww”. So the sound it was making was a protracted “hhhiiiiiissssssssssssssss, haaaaawwwwwww, hhhiiiiissssssssssssssss, haaaaawwwwwwww,” with an intermittent deeper gurgling sound interspersed throughout. Hearing this put me into flight mode, and I immediately got in the car and locked the doors. When I slammed the door, I looked across the passenger seat out through the passenger side window and saw the creature about 15 feet into the woods as it got up and stood up on two legs. It was out of view previously, as I was able to later conclude, because it had been in a completely prostate position in or behind about 3 or 4 feet of saw palmetto. I saw its head rise up first, then its back, then it appeared to go to all fours, and finally pushed itself up with its long arms onto two legs. I briefly saw its side profile as it did not turn and face me directly, but rather stood up facing east in parallel to the road. Once it rose up completely on two legs, its head was obscured by the tree branches above, while at the same time, its feet and legs were obscured by the saw palmetto and other bushes below. So, at this point, I was looking at its torso through about a 3 to 4 foot clearing between the scrub below and the branches above. To say the least, I was completely petrified. I was locked in my car, but absolutely did not feel safe at all. I would estimate that the creature was about 8 feet tall. It was extremely bulky across the bust, with very muscular arms, and I have no doubt that it could have easily busted out the windows and ripped me to shreds if it so desired. It stood there for what I would estimate to be about 3 seconds. I also observed what would commonly be described as a “love-handle”, around the side of the belly area and back. The creature’s hair was black and gray in color and was slicked down against the lighter skin, which could be seen in some places through what appeared to be wet hair. The hair was very thick on the arms and shoulders but less so around the side belly and back areas. It appeared to be wet because the hair was slicked down against the skin. After standing there for approximately three seconds, it hunched forward and walked east in parallel to the road and was immediately out of sight in the trees. Just before the first step, when the creature hunched forward, it put its hands forward to grab onto some branches, which allowed me to get a glimpse of its right hand. From what I could see, the top of the hand and arm was very hairy. It had about 3 inches of hair hanging down from the wrist area that was longer than the rest of the hair on its arm. One thing that stood out to me: when the arm swung up, I noticed the palm area was much lighter than the rest of the arm, almost a light grey or even off-white color, which was in stark contrast to the much darker hair that covered the other areas of the arm, torso and back. As it swam through the bushes, I could see the trees move and shake as it moved forward through the woods along the side of the road. It walked through the scrub for what I would estimate to be about 15 or 20 feet, and then stopped, again completely obscured from my view. Also, the hissing and other vocalization had stopped at this point and everything was completely quiet. After about a minute had passed of no further movement, I saw a tiny dark portion of the creature peek out from behind a pine tree that was growing near the side of the road about 15 or 20 feet in front of me. I could not perceive any detail at this point whatsoever, just that it was hiding and peaking from behind the tree. It appeared to be crouching down because the peek appeared about 3 or maybe 4 feet up the side of the pine tree from the base of the tree on the ground. It was obvious to me that the creature had previously responded to the slamming of the car door and trunk. Not knowing what else to do, I laid down on the horn and started opening and slamming shut the driver’s side door hoping that such nuisance noises would drive it out of the area. It did in fact evoke a response, but not the one I was hoping for. After about 15 seconds of door-slamming and horn-honking, the creature lumbered slowly on all fours in sort of a crouched position from behind the tree onto the side of the road right along the tree line. I quickly slammed the door shut. As soon as the door slammed, the creature reared back and flung a soft-ball sized amount of slimy brown, lumpy material that was about the consistency and color of “wet” peanut butter all over the hood of the car. It slid down the hood and onto the sand in front of the car, leaving a wet residue on the hood. It then put its arms forward, moving out of the crouched position, and then quickly crossed the road in front of me using both its arms and legs to walk on all fours, just like a four-legged animal. It looked back at me briefly and then disappeared into the tree line on the opposite side of the road. One thing I noticed at this point is that the creature was completely soaking wet from head to toe. When it flung the material at the car, I saw water drops shake off of the arm. It was very wet with the hair laying slicked to the skin, much like what you might see with a wet, long-haired dog. The face of the creature was a dark grey color, with very large dark eyes. It had a very large mouth with extremely large, fat lips. The nose was human-like, with one exception, which was large, slightly flared nostrils. The nose did not protrude off its face in proportion to a human’s, but was flatter and more sunken. The creature looked like an ape, but with facial features—especially the nasal area—that were very similar to those of humans. I resumed honking the horn, but did not open the door because I did not have eye contact with it and further knew that it was now in the forest on the same side of the road where I was sitting in the driver’s seat. I did not want to give it the advantage of an open door should it decide to jump out of the woods to my immediate left and attack the car. About 1 minute after disappearing into the tree line, the creature reemerged, this time walking completely upright on two legs, just like a human. It paused at the tree line for a second, and then took one huge step back across the road. The creature, to my shock and horror, was carrying along a “child” of the same creature. It had both arms of the smaller creature grasped in its right hand, and was dangling the juvenile along by its side, with the legs of the smaller creature almost touching the ground. The smaller creature appeared to be completely limp from the neck down, but its eyes were open and it was moving its head and looking toward the trees to which it was being carried. After crossing the road, the creature paused at the tree line on the opposite side of the road, lifted the juvenile up onto its hip, and continued into the scrub. Just before disappearing, the small creature wrapped its legs around the back and stomach and clung to the creature’s chest with its arms. Basically, it was carrying the smaller creature in the same way that a human would carry a child on the hip. It did not reemerge from that point forward, nor did I see any sign or hint of it again. I would estimate that the smaller creature was about three feet tall. It was also a different color than the adult, with the child being more of a light brown, with possibly some hints of a red and blonde, versus the black and grey color of the adult. One thing that stood out about the child is that it appeared to be very, very thin, almost to the point of appearing emaciated. I could actually see the outline of the ribs through the skin and hair that covered it. I sat petrified in my car for about an hour until I looked up and saw two hunters driving Jeeps down the road toward me. They were kind enough to pull my car out of the sand, and quickly got me going on my way out of the forest. Once I got on HWY 44, I left the area at about 85 mph and never looked back. I was in a state of complete shock over what I had experienced. Prior to this experience, I was not a Bigfoot believer. Og how wrong I was.","from Lake Mack go west on CR42, to Deer Haven Rd, go right on Deer Haven Rd till it turns into FSR420(about 4 miles from when you first turn onto Deer Haven and you will be near the spot in the road.",Lake County,Florida,Winter,Report 34954: Stranded motorist has a daytime close encounter with an adult and juvenile near Lake Mack,29.05872,-81.4819,1/15/2012,34954,Class A,djnj3cfxq4,66.81,53.01,39.21,33.17,0.63,0,0.73,0,0,,1029.78,Clear throughout the day.,4,9.99,344,1.16
"In 1963 I was nine years old and living in North Fort Myers, Lee County, Florida. In the weeks before this happened to me, there were several sightings of bigfoot reported in the newspaper. One of the sightings had taken place in a wooded area not far from where I lived. Our house was on the corner of Estate Drive and another street I can't remember, near a canal.  We lived a block away from U.S. 41. On the corner was a street light that usually lit up my bedroom, which I shared with my younger sister and my grandmother. It was around 10pm, and I was in bed, trying to go to sleep. I was startled by some heavy footsteps outside on the grass and as I turned to the window I saw a huge shadow pass by as I continued hearing the footsteps. Whatever it was walked right past my window with a human-like walk. I couldn't make out what it was but it was not any four-legged animal, such as a cow.  This thing walked on two feet and was taller than a man. Then I heard a low pitched but quite loud moan that just scared the heck out of me.  I was not asleep (as my parents later asked) because I sat up straight in bed and seeing that my sister and my grandma were sound asleep, I ran out of my room and jumped into bed with my mother and father sobbing and shaking. I know that I heard and saw bigfoot's shadow.  I had never before, nor never after had an experience like that one.  I will never forget it. At school, when I mentioned what had happened, several kids had stories of sightings, but of course, kids will make up stuff like that.","I don't have directions to that area but I did a search and found Estate Drive in North Fort Myers, so it's not difficult to find.",Lee County,Florida,Spring,Report 6992: Large bipedal creature passes child's window near Ft.Myers,26.6685,-81.8768,2/17/2004,6992,Class B,dhtz8yg5k2,64.43,54.555,44.68,50.42,0.74,0.33,0.91,0,0,,1025.09,Mostly cloudy in the morning.,7,10,335,8.18
"I was helping my mother-inlaw with the begining stages of preparing her 8 acre property so that she could build a house on it. The area is mostly covered in Oak trees, Cabbage Palms, Scrub Oaks, Mullberry trees, and Brazian Pepper trees With wild Grape vines hanging out of the trees to the ground.The majority of the acreage is flat ground covered with Oaks there is a state drainage ditch that runs close to the East side of plot, that is where I was working near the road. on the other side of the ditch there is an extremely low swampy area near the North side of the land along the road in the wet season (May to October)I have seen small fish, turtles, and gators in this area. My wife's cousin lives in a in a house in the ajacent property with Oaks covering a good bit of it but cleared under the trees. On a previous Previous trip out to my mother-inlaws land I in stalled a tempory gate in the barbed wire fence. This time out I hired a friend's 15 year old son  to help haul branches that I was cutting back to a clearing In the middle of the property to be burned at a later date. I cleared and he hauled for a few hours, after a while I noticed that he was getting tired and it was starting to get later in the day. around 5:00-5:30 PM so decided to stop clearing and help him carry the branches back. For a good bit of the time the cousins dog follow him back and forth as he hauled the branches. Anyway as we were walk back we came to a spot where the fence was pulled back between the two parcels and the dog came through the gap in the fence, at the moment coming out of what would be the back of the low swampy area was three whoops. The first one was long and drawn out the two that followed were short. A chill ran down my spine as my mind was trying to place a animal to the sound. It was too loud and too deep to have come from an owl. What ever it came from it came from a large chest. At this point I did think Bigfoot and looked down at the dog but she was calm and seemed happy. I then looked back at the area that the whoops came from and there was a squirrel sitting on a downed palm flicking its tail. This made me dismiss the Bigfoot idea. I immediately asked the boy if he had heard that. The thing is theres no way anyone could have missed it, it was so loud. then he said he heard it on one of his previous trips back. For days I racked my brain for what could have been I have been hiking in the woods and swamps of Florida all my life and know the sounds of the local wild life and couldn't come up with anything that fits the bill. It did sound alot like the Howler Monkeys I've heard in zoos, but the tone was way too deep to be a Howler Monkey. About a week later I was out with a cotractor to talk about putting in a drive back to where the house is to bee built. He also has been in Florida a long time, so told him of the noise I heard and asked him if he could tink of any animal that could have made that sound and he said a Whooping Crain. I said oh! yah that must be it. I went home satisfied with that answer. About week later I was poking around the internet and I looked up info on Whooping Crains and there was recordings on the site I found. When I played the track a chill ran through me not because it was the sound I heard but because it wasn't. I thought about sending a report in for months now, but because of being so unsure of what I heard I held back. Well today I was at my daughters babyshower and the cousin was there for some reason my 12 year old decided that it was a good time to blurt out I saw a Bigfoot, correcting him I said I heard a noise, and of course he said that I heard a Bigfoot I again corrected him and said that I didn't know what it was and elaberated that it was out on the property. At this point the cousin became very interested and asked what it sounded like, so I imitated whoops for her at that she said that she had been hearing strange sounds out there too. I asked if they were whooping and she said yes but there was other sounds to it also she said screaming and whooping I ask if it sounded like a woman screaming and she said kind of but not exactly. She ended it with there is some thing out there.",It's about 15 miles East of I-75 right off of SR. 80 e-mail for more info.,Lee County,Florida,Spring,Report 9885: Possible vocalization east of Ft.Myers,26.6878,-81.6143,12/4/2004,9885,Class B,dhtzyf678y,75.49,64.845,54.2,45.86,0.59,0,0.74,0,0,,1019.94,Clear throughout the day.,4,10,41,3.4
"It was on September 14th 2009, I had a face to face encounter with a Skunk Ape in Fort Myers, Florida. It was about 2-2:30 am I was out in my back yard fishing from a pier in my back yard. I had just moved to Florida on the 1st of Sept. 2009. Honestly I had never heard of a Skunk Ape in my life, squatches and bigfoots yes I had, but being from New Mexico I had never heard of a Skunk Ape. Anyway I was outside fishing and I had caught a couple of snappers and had them there next to me in a bucket, I was dozing off when I heard a noise behind me about 30 feet away in a small canal directly behind me, I was lying down in a lawn cot and not in view of the Skunk Ape. I didn't pay it too much attention thinking it was a Raccoon which I had seen earlier. I heard the noise in the swamp again only louder and closer so I stood up to see what it was. I saw a large figure standing behind about a 5 - 6 ft. palm tree. I couldn't make out what it was so I walked up closer when I saw him turn towards me face to face and only about 15 feet away. I believe I scared or surprised the Ape about as much as he did me, he began to move from side to side and up and down as if mad or frightened. He definitely had an ape-like face and hairy body. Hard to tell the exact color because it was dark except for the light outside on the house, but it did appear to be a darkish brown color, I am guessing over six foot tall because he stood over the Palm tree about a head length. Directly in line with this small ditch or canal are the Railroad tracks leading across the Caloosahatchee River and back into the wilderness and forest or swamps. As I ran into the house to call my wife and son, he also retreated back towards the Railroad tracks and was gone. The house I moved into is in a very Secluded area of Ft.

"About three years ago me and a buddy of mine went scouting in the Goathee State forest off of highway 336/337 like we do almost every other day. Seeing that his house line was aganist the forest. That morning we decided to go further back than usuall, to try and find new deer trails or run up on a family of hogs. We were about three miles back and we started smelling something that I can only explain as being a dead carcuss mixed with a skunk. We have always been interested in Bigfoot, so I knew that it stinks but didnt think it was in central florida. Although there has been sightings in the ocala national forest. We keeped walking and came up on an old logging or ranger trail, it was covered with overgrown grass and had branches all over it. The road had palmettos lining it with a creek or runoff ditch on one side. We started walking down the trail towards our house. We were still about 2 3/4 mile from 337 when we came up on a bend in the trail. We walked around slowly to try and see deer or maybe some hogs on the trail, knowing that there are a couple herds in the area. There was nothing so we keeped walking. I told my friend to stop walking because I thought I saw something standing about 150yds down. I pointed at what I saw and we couldnt figure it out. He told me it was probably a tree, seeing that the had spray painted the trees to get them cut down. We keep walking and then it moved quite quickly toward the side of the trail, by then I was really nervous. We watched it from about 100yds away. It stayed on the left side of the trail neeling in some palmettos just staring at us. After about 10 minutes we were able to slowly get down in the creek out of the road but makeing sure it was still visible. After about 15 minutes of us staring at it, not believing that we actually are seeing a bigfoot it got up and walked back across the trail being followed by a smaller less intimidating one. The smaller one was not as dark as the bigger and had more of a redish color to it. they went out of sight when they crossed the creek into a densely cover underbrush. We found two footprints but no other signs of them. The bigger one was a dark brown with a hint of red in the sunlight. With lighter chest. Not really any hair on his face. We mesure the hight of them by what they walked by and the larger one was around 7 1/2-9 foot tall and the smaller was around 6-7 foot tall.

"I never got a visual. I was hog hunting/scouting an area with fresh activity. The first thing I noticed were some unusual scrapings on some tree's, higher up than any animal found here. Really paid little to no attention to that until after the fact. I went further into a game trail and I heard a noise as if someone, or something was flanking me. It moved when I moved. As it grew darker I changed my direction and then began hearing a screech/growl that I was unfamilar with. Raised the hairs on my neck and I got out of there. I went home and told my wife and we laughed it off. I studied the satellite imagery for the area and chose a close by location for the following day. The following day I enetered thick brush on a game trail working my way back to a dried up lake with a clearing. The brush on either side of me was so thick you couldn't enter if you wanted. I heard, again, something walking with me, and another audible screech/growl, followed by what sounded like a large stick hitting a tree several times. I exited the area fastly. I went to another area 1/2 mile away and walked a horse trail. I experienced the same audible noise and then the tree hitting again. As I approached I felt the ground as it seemed as tho something were stomping or pounding it just off the trails edge. Then a rock was thrown in my direction followed by that screech/growl and then I could hear all hell break loose into the woods. As I was exiting the trail I came across a HUGE track that I took pictures of in comparison to my size 14 shoe it was nearly twice as long and wide. There were no prints in the footprint, like what my shoe left behind. I could make out the heel,ball and toes.

"My father and I were riding south in our car down forest road 65, in the Ocala National Forest.  We were nearing the point where 65 intersects with forest road 90.  The road is sandy and white, and as we were moving along we noticed a figure up in the distance, silhouetted against the white sandy road that was going up hill.  We were a good distance away, and we initially thought it must be a man, but there was no campground in that area, and besides in July, it is extremely hot out there.

"It was last bow season around the middle of sept in Ocala Na.forest, I was in the tree 1/2 hour before daylight, i had an encounter with a black bear 2 or 3 days before in the same area, it came out on the trail on the way to my stand 20 yards away from me, i have a game cam on my bow that takes good video, & i took a video of it crossing in front of me to show my wife that all the bears that i tell her about were real, Now she believes there are bears, But knowing how & what bears look like in the wild & sound like when they are running away or walking to you, this was no bear, around 45 mins after daylight i felt like something was watching me then i heard a loud sound like a big tree had fallen, but it wasn't one, it was something big that been thrown at my direction, maybe 250 feet away then a scream like i have never heard before let out like a pissed off kid that had not gotten his way & it left in front of me crossing back & forth as if it was trying to let some others know to run or get out of the area , scared  the S#&*^%$ out of me as bad as it made out a scream, the scream went till i could not hear it anymore ,at least a 1000 yards away, i was in the Lake Delancy west back area i think it was off 66 not to far from the Ocklawaha river, to this day i will never go back to this area with out a gun even during bow season , till i see what that was i will not trust the Ocala area.Thank god for my Fla gun permit, i am not a little girl, just not stupid, Hope this helps you find something to prove that they are here , but  you don't have to convince me i am 99% sure thats what i heard , I live in Middleburg where a lot of your sightings take place in Florida, i hunt Camp Blanding & Jennings Forest where i lived off live oak lane till i was 17, i have walked all of that area & when i was 12 i was chased by something for a 1/4 mile 1/2 hour before dark, it smelled like nothing i had ever smelled i my life & it had a grunt i will never forget , it gave me the same felling that something was watching me just like in Ocala, but i didn't see what it was that time either, i was in too much of a hurry to get away & home to a safe place, my Grandmother if she was still alive would tell you that i never opened the front screen door, i busted right threw it & grabbed my 22 rifle & sat on the floor waiting for it, lucky for me it had stopped the chase 100's of yards before my home, but i wasn't taking that chance, to this day i still will not go anywhere with out a gun close, I am 6ft 1inch &275 lbs, but i am not a fool.

"On February 21, 2012 at aprox 2:55pm while traveling on a back county heavily wooded road in Ocala Florida, I observed an animal coming out of the woods on the South side of the road heading North. From this distance I first thought this was a bear coming across the road, however I did notice that the way this animal carried himself did not appear to be a bear. The animal was walking on all fours but appeared to be larger in the front of his body but lower in the hind end, much unlike a bear. He seemed to be bobbing up and down and seemed to me that it was injured. As I approached closer I could see that he was walking on the knuckles of his front arms, appearance was dark brown shaggy coat, not like smooth sheen coat or  fur that would be on a Florida black bear. As the animal approached the edge of pavement, he then stood up on it's hind legs with a slight curvature and legs bent, he then crossed the road on its hind legs arms swaying or swinging (longer appearance of arms as that of a primate)as I approach closer to the animal and start to slow my vehicle down, this animal turned its head and glanced partially, (matter of factly). At this point I could tell there were no ears such that a bear would have and knew it definitely was not a Florida black. The upper body was massive and as it went down to the hind quarters got increasing smaller. I would estimate that this animal would be 7ft aprox. weight would be around 400 lbs (my best guess).I could not tell what the hind feet looked like due to the amount of hair but I did note that they were longer than that of a bear. As he neared the edge of opposite side of the road he then returned to walk on all fours and as he entered the edge of the wooded area he stood upright again placing right arm on a pine tree, looked over at me and at this i was at a stand still in my vehicle, I could see a full face. Distance from the animal was 50-60ft away.I could tell that he had more of a round shaped eyes, from this distance they appeared to be dark in color with a lighter color of hair around eyes (short and greyish brown, older in  appearance) same hair color would be around the side of face and what would be the area where the ears would be. The nose appeared to be shorter than that of a bear but different than an ape, didn't have a larger lower lip or chin. the area where the mouth and nose is was short hair and skin appearance.I could also see that the long hair on the arms did not go all the way to the hand area. Hands seemed from that distance to have five fingers much like that of a primate would have. At this point he entered the wooded area and was out of sight.",,Marion County,Florida,Winter,Report 33764: Daylight sighting by a retired Wildlife Officer outside Ocala,29.16722,-82.01917,2/21/2012,33764,Class A,djjtvterqg,73.71,63.175,52.64,50.03,0.72,0.08,0.99,0,0,,1022.47,Mostly cloudy in the afternoon.,6,10,65,0.28
I was out trail riding in a remote part of the Ocala National Forest when I became stuck in a mud hole. I was out there for several hours waiting for someone to come pull me out. What got my attention first was the sound of someone hitting something against a tree which striked me as odd considering where I was at and I didn't hear any other vehicles prior to the knock so I proceeded to approach the sounds after walking about 300 yards away from my vehicle I saw what I thought was a huge man in a ghillie suit striking a pine tree with a large stick as I got closer I realized it was not a man but a huge creature that I will never forget as long as I live. It had a huge chest probably 60in. across and though it was in a slumped standing position it had to be 8 feet tall with long muscular arms and long chest and mid section like its legs were shorter than chest area. As I was trying slowly to back away to get back to my truck I stepped on a stick and it immediately turned to look at me using its whole body to do so and then it ran off caring stick in a graceful stride through the woods.,Off of woods road 572A by squirels nest meadow.,Marion County,Florida,Fall,Report 37275: Dusk sighting of a bigfoot tree knocking in the Ocala National Forest,28.99496,-81.59869,11/11/2012,37275,Class A,djjuznmeus,79.21,69.355,59.5,58.1,0.77,0.45,0.92,0,0,,1025.39,Mostly cloudy starting in the evening.,5,9.91,83,2.35
"I am a 39 yr. old professional in Miami, Fl. I had an experience 24 yrs. ago that I will never forget. When it first happened, I shared the details with family and a few close friends but no one believed me. It became a topic of such ridicule that I just stopped talking about it (what was the point). I've always had a casual interest in the bigfoot dilema. When I moved (in 1974) to south florida, neighborhood kids would tell me stories of a bigfoot-like creature (they called it a ""skunk-ape"") roaming the fringes of the everglades with the occasional sighting. They said it was large (about 9'), smelly and a very swift runner. This all seemed too bizarre and I really didn't believe them. Then when I was 15 yrs. old I had my experience. I'm not about to say that what I saw was a skunk-ape, but I can say that (since my experience) I absolutely believe that animals (even large ones) can co-exist around us without our knowledge of their presence. Here's my story .... I was with my family on a summer camping trip at Johnathan Dickinson State Park (just north of Jupiter, Fl). There was an observation tower (about 30 ft high) along the same road that leads to the campground. About 5:30 or 6:00 pm I jogged from the campground to the tower alone (it was probably 2 to 3 miles). When I got there, the fence around the tower was locked. Since this was an un-manned tower setback from a road that had very little traffic (in-fact the entire time I was gone from camp, there were no cars), I decided I would hop the fence. I'm not one for blatantly breaking rules, so I was very careful not to make too much noise climbing the fence. When I got to the top of the tower, there was a built-in wood bench that wrapped along the perimeter of the deck (about 12'X 12'). I spent about 5-10 minutes looking in all directions (but there wasn't much to see). The skys were clear and there was about 45 minutes to an hour of sunlight left. There was a clearing of low-lying brush (about 3-4 ft high) that extended out from the tower for about 30-50 yds. in all directions. At that point it became pretty densely wooded. It was peaceful up there and I was tired so I rested for about 20-30 minutes by laying down on the bench. When I got up, I noticed the sunlight was beginning to fade so I figured I'd better get moving. I remember being upset with myself for staying so long because I would not make it back to camp until nightfall and I didn't want my parents to worry. When I got to the base of the tower, I climbed the 8' high fence at a point that was perpendicular to the road. Once on the other side, I could walk the 100' or so along the fenceline to the road. Unfortunately, I slipped at the top of the fence so I instinctively pushed off the fence and dropped to the ground on the other side. When I came down, I landed in a bush which made a lot of noise (I had been deliberately very quiet up til that moment. The position of my body was slouched over and facing away from the fence towards the woods beyond the low brush. It seemed as soon as I hit the ground, making all that noise, something popped its head up from under the brush (about 25 yds. away) and I saw it immediately because I just happened to be looking in that direction. I saw just its head at first and we just stared at each other for a few seconds. At first, I was not sure whether I was looking at an animal's head or a person's head. I remember it was rounded at the bottom and more elongated towards the top. It seemed a little bigger than mine and was covered with short silvery-gray hair. Its face seemed human with a flat nose, its eyes were small and dark. It made no sound. After a few seconds of silent starring, it turned towards the road and began moving quickly. It seemed to be running on all fours at first; but after about 10 yds. it stood up on just two legs and continued to scamper until it crossed the road and then disappeared into the woods. I would guess that it was about 6-7' tall. It's frame was very large from the hips up and it was covered with shaggy silvery-gray hair. After it was out of sight, I stood there for a moment trying to rationalize what I had seen. I saw it clear enough to know what it wasn't. It wasn't a man - it was definitely an animal. It wasn't a bear, deer or panther. Not even close. Surprise had turned to confusion and was now becoming fear. I didn't want to hang around (defenseless) against an animal larger, stronger and faster than myself. I ran back to camp, checking behind me as I ran. By the way it had reacted, I assumed it was probably as scared of me as I was of it. When I reached camp, I tried to tell my family, but they just laughed it off and said it was probably a dog or a homeless man. Of course, I knew this was not the case, so I became upset. Not wanting to continue the conversation, my father became stern and so I dropped the subject. The next day we went home and I've never been back. Until recently, I've pretty much kept this story to myself over the past 24 yrs. When I found your site (and some others)on the internet and read of other encounters it motivated me to share my experience. I sent info about my experience to a web-site dedicated to finding ""skunk-apes"", but I really found much of their material to be uncredible. I wanted to share my experience on this site because I feel your opinions and observations are genuine, thoughtful and reserved. P.S. I remember watching the local news one night (around 1977) about a supposed skunk-ape sighting by not less than 14 people during an air-boat ride thru the everglades. They interviewed the driver and a couple of riders who stated seeing a large hair-covered animal walking upright near the edge of an island in the swamp. I thought having so many witnesses would have made this a more credible and compelling sighting. Although I have read of many sightings in Florida which matched the stories my neighbors told me when I was younger, I have never seen or read anything (on the internet) about the airboat sighting. Have you or any of your readers ever heard of this sighting. Perhaps it was proven later to be a hoax or a mis-identification.",The entrance to the park is off US 1.

"I was driving south east on US Hwy 441 North between Ft. Drum and Okeechobee, Florida on Jan. 18, 2004. It was almost dusk, approx. 5:30 PM. There was only one other car on the road and it was several miles away in the west bound lane coming at me ( two lane road). I took this opprotunity to remove my sun glasses. A spring type clip on which I need both hands to remove. I turned my head and dropped them in my purse on the seat next to me. As I looked up toward my rear view mirror a flash of movement caught my attention. It happened so fast all I saw was the last few steps of a small hominid running across the road in front of me. It wasn't close but I'm not sure how far away. It stopped on the edge of the road for a split second and made a leap over the roadside ditch and a barbed wire fence. I tired to reason I had seen a limpkin or a sandhill crane but knew it wasn't. I braked as soon as I saw the first movement and slowed to 20 mph by the time I thought I was where it had leaped into the bushes. I couldn't see any bushes moving or water movement. I was so intent on looking at the side of the road I didn't think to look into the pasture on the other side of the barbed wire. If I had been sure in my mind I had seen a wading bird I wouldn't have slowed as I see them all the time. I knew in my heart it was something different from what I'd ever seen before. I have reported this to the Mysterious Encounters web site and have thought more on it and will now revise my estimates of it's size. I judge it to be 3 1/2 to 4 feet tall and between 75 and a 100 pounds. It had a very round head on an upright body no neck to speak of. The hair was long and silky not matted or tangled. It was a brownish red, more light brown than red. I'm sure it had it's head turned away from me and I was seeing the back of it's head as I didn't see any facial features. I remembered seeing it's foot later. It was like a person of color whose skin is darker than the sides of their feet. The hair hung lightly over the sides of the edges of it's foot. I saw one arm and it reached almost to the knee.  When it leaped it didn't swing it's arms out or bend it's knees to jump it just leaped flat footed, pushing off. The distance it leaped was approx. 20 to 25 feet. Seeing it bothered me and then I saw the Redwood Giant episode of Mysterious Encounters, Jan. 24, on OLN. A man on the show said a three foot tall hominid ran in front of his car in NC. It hit me like a shot, I knew what I had seen then. That's when I filled out the report form on their web site. I did a Google search tonight and found your site. The more I've thought about it and talked with my family ( after they stopped laughing) we have come up with other times we could have been in the presence of these hominds over the years. Once two years ago my son and I were on the Kissimmee River, the western boundry between Okeechobee County and Highlands County, Florida. We heard a call...scream.. yell, from a distance. After discussing it my son said it must have been a big bellied redneck out hunting or a skunk ape, we laughed it off but kept a watch around us the rest of the day. It was very disturbing. A year a go a friend and I were on the board walk of the Grassy Waters Preserve on North Lake Blvd in northern Palm Beach County, Fl. It was early morning and we were walking to the end to go into the little nature museum and looked out across the water and sawgrass toward a cypress head. Standing in plain sight was a BIG dark figure. It would bend over and do something in the water at the base of a cypress tree, then stand up and act like it was eating something. This went on for quite a while, bend over- stand up. The woman who was in charge of the museum came out with a pair of binoculars but they were so badly fogged we couldn't make out details. Just a big homind figure. There are many more times and incidents I could relate but they go back to the mid 1970's. So I will stick with the present.","The hominid ran across hwy 441, the location was maybe a 1/3 the distance between Ft. Drum and Okeechobee.

"I grew up on a pretty good piece of property that was backed up to a pretty good amount of acreage of swampland. My brother, dad and I always went to the back pasture where we would play in the pond which connected to the swamp. we had a pretty good dry season one year an we went back to the pond to see how bad the water had gone down and noticed very large tracks of some sort, as we were approaching the pond first thought was one of the cows had walked through but as we got closer they were human foot tracks but abnormally very large tracks. My dad had a tape measure in the truck we drove to the pond we measured the tracks an they were approximately 29 to 30 inches in length. I'm not sure how big Bigfoot tracks usually are but I've never seen anyone with feet that big. My dad said that it was people tracks but I beg to differ. I'm not sure on how wide they were but my guess was that they were around 10 inches wide. I know when you get reports like this people exaggerate some and even a lot but I'm a 1000% sure on what i saw I've never seen anymore tracks after that, Since my brothers and I are in the woods a lot hunting and I've never seen anything like it. I've heard strange noises in the woods and in the swamp that I couldn't explain or even could possibly mimic but who knows could be anything. Also this wasn't the only encounter that I've had, It was a couple years ago me and a buddy of mine always hog hunt in the woods on the back side of our neighborhood with his parents. We decided to go for a walk to a little slew we had found while hunting. We gotten about 100 to 160 yards into the tree line the moon was full so the woods came alive. As we got on to the game trail, I noticed something in the palmettos among the oak trees. I told him to stop and get down and be still that I think i see a big hog by the oak tree about 30 yards off the game trail 50 yards ahead of us. He spotted the figure by the tree and we began to watch it. The figure never moved so we stood up to keep moving. When we did it quickly stood up and quickly moved behind the tree we just froze and watched to see if whatever it was would come out of hiding. As we were watching the tree we heard something heavy footed walking around the pepper trees off to the side of us, my friend freaked out and took off running out of the tree line toward the houses. I had no choice to follow after him because I did not wanna stay to find out what it was by myself. As I turned to run I seen a tall figure through the pepper trees, I didn't stop to see what it was but it was huge and wasn't on all fours as I reached the fence. I heard a low gurgle sounding exhale come from the trees, my first thought was a bear but I have never seen or witnessed a bear in Florida. Of course they are here but I've never heard of anyone seeing a bear in the town i lived in, but it was bigger than any bear I've seen. I lived in Montana for a few months and have seen bears, monstrous black bear to be specific but i am 98% it was not a bear I'm not taking out the possibility that it was, but i couldn't see it being one.",First incident was located in Okeechobee off of Hwy. 98 near the the Kissimmee River near a state park and a few hunting preserves in a place called Basinger.

Because of the number of alligators there, I at first thought an animal was getting bitten and dragged into the water as we heard water splashing and the yell continued and went from sounding hurt and suprised to angry and mad  (I had heard for a long time that there was a big foot in that area, but have never heard, smelled, or seen anything...well into our 40's we never thought we would.)  The yell lasted approx 5 seconds, going from something sounding like it was hurt fighting and then angry.  It made our hair stand strait up.  My husband immediately retrieved his gun, and we were very uncomfortable all evening.  We have never heard anything like this before...until...we watched a special on bigfoot and the gentleman from florida stated he had audio.  When we heard the audio, we both jumped to our feet in shock, as it was the same type of yell we had heard up river...It is a sound you would never forget.","Very primitive..swampy area with a fresh water river, only accessable by boat...We can take you to the place where it happened.",Charlotte County,Florida,Fall,Report 27587: Couple hears an unusual scream while camping overnight on the Peace River,27.07842,-81.99105,10/20/2005,27587,Class B,dhvdn1rznp,87.83,81.72,75.61,72.3,0.81,0.25,0.61,0.0001,0.72,rain,1013.64,Foggy in the morning and humid throughout the day.,7,8.5,92,3.34
"In the spring of 2006 several members of the county’s development review team (planners, engineers and legal) were invited to tour a 90,000 acre ranch that was proposed for development.  The intent was to give the reviewers a “base-line” as to existing conditions, identify areas to be developed  and areas proposed to be established as a nature preserve. The developer provided a “swamp buggy” for the tour.  It was an  old, modified (top removed) school bus with large tires.  It maneuvered around the ranch, much of which was swamp, for a little more than two hours. The ranch extremely active with wildlife … the fields and pastures with deer and wild pigs; the swamp with large birds and dozens of gators.  Although the ranch was laced with timber and crop roads, many were flooded from a very wet winter / spring and therefore the swamp buggy was forced to take routes not often traveled.  Near the end of the tour about two miles from the ranch’s bunk houses and barns,  the driver had to tap his breaks to avoid a family of wild hogs (2 large and 3 small).  The guide, who was also the ranch manager, mentioned the wildlife was much more active than usual, offering that it was because of the heavy rains and flooded areas …  joking that “we even brought out the three little pigs for you.”  I was sitting next to where the guide was standing and I said “yeah, you even provided a gorilla”. He looked down at me but said nothing as I pointed out of the bus across a flooded area to a small rise, maybe 150 yards away.  He said nothing so I let it drop. A few days later a member of the legal staff that had taken the tour came to me and asked what did I mean when I mentioned a “gorilla” on the tour.  I explained while others were watching the hogs run to the left of the bus I was looking at the flooded pasture to the right and had seen a large bipedal standing slightly over the rise.  I described what I saw and she said “you need to talk with Rich (county attorney) …  he saw it too.  We saw exactly the same thing …  a very large bipedal (7’ or more) standing just over the rise (could see it from knees up) with it’s back to us.  It was covered with very dark hair, no neck … what I would call bullet shaped and was from 125 to 150 yards away.  It was only visible for maybe 5 seconds because as the bus kept moving heavy growth blocked the view … but for those 5 seconds it was an unobstructed view.  As the bus passed, the creature turned, assumingly to see what the engine noise was … but the entire upper body turned from the waist.  As it turned, it appeared to be holding something in its arms.","From I75 south take exit #164, take US17/Duncan Rd north 1 miles to74/Bermont Rd, go right on 17 about 15 miles.

"I have a few, where I live in Charlotte county, borders the web reserve, and is woods for miles and miles, when I started to build my home, just after hurricane Charlie, I had an rv trailer on my property to live in while my home was being built, so I could keep an eye on the building supplies, I had a hot tub outside of my trailer and I would take a soak in it every other night or so usually after midnight, many times I would hear what would sound like someone smacking 2 2x4s together some distance away, and sometimes it would come from different directions, I would sit there thinking to myself why in the world is someone working out here in the woods at 1am, but I just blew it off, after the home was built I didn't hear the wood smacking anymore, because I was in my home and not outside late at night, then I had a deck built on the front of my home, my home is a 2 story home and the deck is on the second floor in the front, after the deck was built we started using it at night and would you believe it I started hearing the sticks hitting again every once in a while not every night, still I was thinking to my self why is someone working so late at night, then I was watching a bigfoot show and saw that they bang sticks together to talk to each other and then it all made sense to me, about 5 months ago one of my lids to one of my fish boxes were lifted off and about 20lbs of mullet were taken out of my boat in my yard, I went out to my boat around 3am to get ready to go fishing and during my walkaround of the boat to check the lights and tires I noticed my ice box lid not on, the lid weighs around 40 to 45lbs and has a bungee cord on it, the bungee cord was still attached but the lid was pulled to the side and fish were taken, and I had a weird feeling that something was looking at me so i fixed the lid and jumped into my truck and drove off, also about 3 or 4 months ago I took my son on a cubscout camp out and we had a small group of around 12 to 15 children, usually there are over 1000 people at a camp out but this time it was just our pack on a special camp, I woke around 230am to use the bathroom and then laid down to go to sleep then I heard a yell that lasted for about 10 seconds and it sounded like one of the yells that I have heard returned on one of the shows on tv, I was born and raised in the woods in fla and am a commercial fisherman and know all the sounds that you will hear in the woods and near shore, and in fla we have a bunch, some from normal animals like foxes or bobcat or panthers will make you get chicken skin and your hair stand on end, but the yell I heard that night was like nothing I've ever heard, it didnt scare me but I knew what it was.",(specific directions omitted),Charlotte County,Florida,Winter,"Report 35330: Fish stolen from a boat, possible knocks and vocalizations near Punta Gorda",26.91675,-81.96517,5/7/2012,35330,Class B,dhv9nu4c3j,87.45,77.55,67.65,67.7,0.73,0.28,0.56,0,0,,1012.79,Partly cloudy in the evening.,10,9.96,228,2.62
"I have hunted in most of the management areas in and around this state. I was on a bow hunt in the Citrus wildlife management area. I go out 1 hour or so before daylight. I had put my stand out the day before and just parked in pitch black dark area. I got out and walked to the other side of the suv to get my stuff out, before I could do that I heard something jump out of the bushes behind me. I stood motionless and a strong smell of defecation was there. I talked about the smell and it disappeared. I opened the door and got my flashlight to see what was there and it was gone. By the time daylight rolled around there was six or so more cars that had come through and wipe out all tracks that I could have found. This was the first of 5 incidents of it.   2. Two weeks later I moved my stand to a different area due to all the other hunters. I went out an hour before daylight again and parked got in my stand and waiting for daylight. Right before daylight I heard a call unlike anything I have ever heard before. I have heard hogs, deer, and all other types of animal calls including bears. This call was not like any of them. As the morning went by more cars and hunters came into the area. I heard something big running towards me and it sat down 20 to 30 feet in front of me on the only blind spot I had. I waited for about ten minutes and figured another hunter had sat there, so I cleared my throat to see if it was human and it got up and ran off real fast. I couldn't see it. 3. Two or three weeks later I decide to go fishing at the gulf and was driving past the area I hunted at when out of the wood line a big hairy, black bigfoot ran in front of me with my bright lights on.

"Yesterday, on October 31st, 2010, I was hunting in Flying Eagle WMA with a friend when I discovered something that I thought was very unusual. It was around 10:20 in the morning when we decided to meet back up and do some scouting for our last afternoon hunt on my quota. I had set my friend up a few hundred yards or so from Hwy 44 in the morning before daylight and I continued on for about 3/4-1 mi. on the edge of the swamp we were hunting. As I continued on I jumped something that ran off and sounded unlike a deer or hog but didn't think anything of it. We were sitting on ground. After we met up we started walking back towards the truck and saw a couple of wet areas (puddles) when I said to my friend, let me check and see if there are any prints leading to the water to get a drink. As I walked over there to see I looked down and noticed something out of the ordinary. I called my friend over to show him. It was a footprint, similar to a humans. Not real large but kind of wide for the length of it. It was so fresh that you could still see the thermal lines in the mud from the bottom of the foot. It was the only one that we could really make out. The heal and ball made deep impressions while the toes were not really deep in the mud in comparison. I had my cell phone with me so I took two photos of the print and one of the area we were in then he marked a tree next to it so we could find it again. It just seemed very odd to find a print like that in the middle of a swamp! We returned after lunch for an afternoon hunt. I did notice one other thing with the squirrels after we returned. I didn't go as far this time, but I noticed the squirrels barking more than usual off in the distance. It is how they warn others of pending danger. As time went on they got closer and closer to where I was sitting and then all of a sudden went silent. Just an observation! I have spent most of my life in the woods in florida either hiking, biking or hunting this was the first time I noticed something like this. It is probably human but who would be out there barefoot?? We ended up laughing quite hard about it after we named him Eddie the Yeti and I will ad this is not the first time I have heard or smelt something out of the ordinary while in the woods.",Located in Flying Eagle WMA about 5 miles East of downtown Inverness.,Citrus County,Florida,Fall,Report 28450: Possible footprint found and vocalizations heard in the Flying Eagle Wildlife Management Area,28.84542,-82.20726,10/31/2010,28450,Class B,djjs174sb0,84.03,72.11,60.19,61.45,0.77,0.24,0.8,0,0,,1018.83,Mostly cloudy until evening.,4,9.74,257,0.5
"The following is the account of my student, identified below. He is with me as I type this. He does not have a computer, so I therefore am making this report for him. I am his high school biology teacher. ""We (4 of us) were riding in a pickup truck on a dirt road on my grandfather's property. That portion of the property is planted pine flatwoods with little undergrowth other than native grass. Three of us were in the back of the pickup, looking for deer with a spotlight. We were traveling about 10 mph. The person with the spotlight swept the light across the side of the road, and all 3 of us that were in the back of the truck saw this creature standing about 25 feet from us, and back off the road in the trees. It was just standing there looking at us. The light swept across the creature, and all three of us saw it and yelled or said something. The light was on it a second or two. We immediately backed up and with the light looked again but could no longer see it creature. It was gone. We were all very excited asked each other what it was, but confirmed that we had all see the same thing. Here is what we saw: It was about 8-9 feet tall, and covered with long dark fur. There were no ears on the head, but it's eyes shown yellow in the light and the sholders appeared like a football player's. His belly stuck out to the sides a bit, like he was thicker in that area. His arms were long and appeard to hang nearly to his knees. When we backed up to see him again, he was already gone, but we all noticed a really foul smell, that I would describe as similar to a sour hog.

"One night in early April of 1994, my two daughters and I were driving in our car, headed west, on SR 16 near Penny Farms in Green Cove Springs, Florida. The stretch of road was lightly scattered with houses, but had mostly dense wooded areas with an occasional cow pasture. The weather was clear with a light night fog. As we approach one of the more deserted areas along the road, I spotted something off to the right hand side of the road. At this point it was not clear as to what it was. I slowed down a bit thinking it may be a dog or animal. I've commonly seen many nocturnal animals along this stretch of road in the past. As we approached somewhat closer, it stepped out into the path of the car. We, at this time, were moving approximately 20 MPH as the animal came in to direct headlight. I was stunned to see that which I had assumed would be a raccoon, actually stood at least 6 to 7 feet tall, walked on two legs, and was covered with brown hair, (was somewhat skinny). I completely stopped the car as it crossed the road. A car coming in the opposite direction stopped as well. I almost could not come to terms with what my eyes were seeing. My oldest daughter, which was nine years old at the time, said ""oh my gosh! What is that?” It crossed the road quickly into the thick brush on the left hand side of the road. Once again she said ""Dad, what was that?"" I sat there with my mouth hanging open, then tried to think of what to say that wouldn’t spook her. We had just passed a cow pasture about 30 feet prior, so I babbled, ""I a...a...a think it was a cow."" We drove silently for a few miles. The whole time I'm thinking to myself, ""You just saw a Skunk Ape"". She then turned to me and said, "" Dad, cows don't walk on two legs... Looked more like a Bigfoot to me."" I stuck with my ridiculous ""cow story"" until she was much older. She's now 18 years old, and we've laughed about the cow story for years. These days we both use each other as our witness that on that April in 1994 we both did truly indeed see a Bigfoot. My youngest daughter was asleep in the back seat during the entire event. But she says she has seen plenty of cows anyway. Cows... INDEED!","SR16 near Penny Farms in Green Cove Springs. About a 1/2 mile from CR218.

"It was a warm day in June of 2005 it was around noon and me and three of my friends decided to go fishing we had cooked left over pork chops as bait since where we were fishing on private property and we were tresspassing I have been reluctant to say anything about this, after about an hour or two of fishing the older of my two friends said ""Hey (name) I think theres a bear in those pallmetos."" So I being the oldest of the three decided to go over to the bushes and check it out when I got about ten feet from the bushes I saw two dark brown eyes filled fear and curiosity I stopped dead in my tracks and then the creature let out a loud grumbleing noise so naturally being as terrefied as I was I let out a yell which is when I saw the creatures eyes go from fear and curiosity to rage and anger then it rose out of a crouching position to tower about nine feet above me I can distinctly remeber the odor coming off the creature and around the eyes there was no fur the creature also had a very noticible mark on it face right above the upper lip I cant remeber if it was the left or right side, the creature had a flat nose kind of like a gorilla and human mix the skin was really dark and course the creature had extremely long arms and also there was no hair around the lips the fur was really dark and notted sort of like a matted dog.  So after the creature rose out of the crouching position we all ran up the hill to the house to get a camera and a .270 we returned to the scene several hours later to find the pork chops gone the fish gone the poles scatterd around on the ground and we had all had our shirts off since it had been hot and they were laid about 11 feet up on a live oak branch with no sign of the creature left. Then about five days later I was riding my bike down a trail that is by my house going to a freinds house who lives on bluejay when out of the corner of my eye I saw something that grabbed my attention I looked to my left to see a huge creature walking across the scrub oaks about 200 yards away this was to the left of me by the swamp which has since dried up so I proceeded to quickly turn around and head home. And recently since about the begining of the summer of 2007 I have been hearing wood knocks in the woods by my house, normally they come from three diffrent locations but sometimes there will be four or five, the knocks are about two to three minutes apart the most recent knocks were on monday october 15 2007 at 6:32 in the morning I havent wanted to report these because I was tresspassing and I never really knew how to.",Middleburg,Clay County,Florida,Summer,Report 21879: Teens have very Close Encounter with Creature,30.11584,-81.94118,6/15/2005,21879,Class A,djmer6km2p,93.86,84.925,75.99,74.14,0.77,0.56,0.27,0,0,,1011.36,Humid and partly cloudy throughout the day.,8,9.2,229,1.17
"At about 9:30 at night, I was back in an area Near Lake Asbury where there is a Church camp in the woods. It was dark, but there was enough light to see what I saw. It was about 8' tall, and was running straight across from me about 50' away. It was covered with black, shaggy hair. Its head was kind of dome-like, and its shoulders were very big. It appeared to be trotting, and its shoulders twisted back and forth as it ran, but its arms hung straight down at its sides, not pumping back and forth like a human's would. Its arms hung down nearly to its knees. I saw it and watched it for about 7 seconds. I started shaking, because we had talked about this creature in class, and I immediately knew what I had seen. About a minute later, I smelled this horrible smell that smelled like a wet, nasty pig pen after a rain (we have pigs so I'm sure of the smell). About 5 minutes later I heard some hooting noises. They were quite loud, and there were about 3 hoots one after another, then a pause of about 2 seconds, then about 3-4 more hoots. It sounded similar to some of the Bigfoot sounds, hoots, we listened to in my Biology class, but they were longer.","It is off of a county road (739), just NE. of Middleburg, Fl.",Clay County,Florida,Fall,Report 16727: Nighttime sighting by teen at Lake Asbury off HWY 739 outside Middleburg,30.05287,-81.82794,11/17/2006,16727,Class A,djmfcyywwv,63.39,51.77,40.15,42.09,0.7,0.01,0.9,0,0,,1015.91,Clear throughout the day.,4,10,302,1.17
"A couple of years ago, my best friend at the time and I were just hiking through the woods like we typically did back then. We weren't making a lot of noise, but we were joking around as usual and laughing a little bit, and not really paying attention to our surroundings. We were originally planning on visiting a spot where several large, thick blue berry bushes grew to pick some of the berries, until we rounded a corner to the right in the trail. Approximately forty or fifty yards away, I noticed a loomering figure. It was tall, black, and had thick fur that appeared to be semi-long and coarse. It wasn't facing us and due to the height of the bushes and palmettos, a lower half the body wasn't visible to our eyes. My guess at it's height is somewhere between six and seven feet tall at the top of its head. The creature was moving away from us and though I don't recollect any noise ( I'm assuming I was far too frightening to remember it, because only seconds after seeing it, we ran ), but my best friend, who was standing directly at my side, claims she heard it moving through the foliage and creating quite a bit of sound such as breaking twigs, branches, and leaves rustling.

"Hiking through the woods this morning with my younger brother after visiting a creek, we were halted on the trail by a series of loud whacks at approximately 11:30 am.

What we heard next, perhaps a minute and a half to two minutes following the last knock, made me jump. It was a cry. A loud, long, drawn out type cry that I cannot associate with any other animal. It wasn't a cow. It wasn't a bear. It wasn't a bird of any kind that I know of. And it most definitely was NOT canine.

While archeery hunting in the Camp Blanding WMA Block C I heard a loud growling grunting sound as  I was walking on Sapp road toward my truck .

"A friend and I had been on Black creek in Clay county for a few hours bass fishing with absolutely no luck.  Working the last stretch of bank before we called it a day when I heard something walking in the woods.  I could hear large footsteps and something that sounded like it was scooping water or slapping water, I really can't describe the sound. Now I know this particular area and the wildlife that inhabits it pretty well I think, It is full of deer, wild boar, turkeys, a few black bears, and the rest of the small woodland critters.  And this sound was way too large to be any of them. Back to my story, after we heard the noise I motioned to my friend to be silent so I could trolling motor over to the bank so I could try to get a look.  As we were silently getting closer it seemed like the creature must have noticed us because we stuck out like a sore thumb against the back drop of the creek, while it stayed perfectly camoflauged in the wood.  We sat there for a few moments hoping it would move and reveal itself to us which it never did. So, as the sun was dropping we had to get back to the boat ramp, we quitely circled away from the shore.  Just as we got away from the tree line something landed in the water about 50 or so feet from the boat. It was a loud splash like a rock or heavy object was thrown because it hit about 15 feet from shore.  Both startled we put out life jackets on and got ready to leave when we heard the footstep start back up, and they sounded as if they were running away at a brisk pace and it sounded like it was a long stride. Jokingly we said we had just encountered a sasquatch just like every other time I heard something unusual on that body of water.  But as we made our way back to the dock I noticed we were within half a mile from powerlines.  And were within a mile of the county dump that I know for a fact is a popular spot with the local whitetail deer population.","250 yards west of the train tressel on the north bank.

"In may of 1973 I and my father were working for XXXXX XXXXXX Drywall in Boynton Beach, Florida. We had just finished a job and came into the office for a new assignment. Frank told us he had a ""special job"" and would consider it a favor if we did it. The developer of Boca Teeca had a couple of hunting cottages, in the everglades, and it wouldn't take us more than a couple of days. We would have to camp over since it was too far to drive and there wasn't any lodging around. Now my wife was over 7 months pregnant and I wasn't crazy about doing the job. However, Frank was persausive, ""If you want to continue working for me you'll do it!"" I didn't have health insurance and was making payments to Bethesda Hospital, in advance, for my wife's upcoming hospital stay. So I caved in and took the job. The next day we packed some camping gear in the station wagon. My idea of camping was a state park or KOA camp. We set off. The directions were simple: take the Florida Turnpike south and go west on Alligator Alley, about halfway across you will see a gravel road to the left. Pass it and take the next gravel road to the left. The work site would be halfway between Alligator Alley and the Tamiami Trail. Looking back I would say this would have put it in Collier County, Florida (the beginning of everglades country). We taveled miles and miles, under the hot sun, on Alligator Alley, for what seemed miles and miles of miles and miles. Coming to the second gravel road we turned left and traveled more miles and miles down a washboard gravel road. I had packed fishing gear and a .22 cal. magnum pistal (with holster) and two .30 cal.M1 carbines. A canal ran parralel to road and I had at least wanted to get my hook wet. I talked him into stopping for 15 mins. or so (to stretch our legs) and I dropped a line in the canal. It was full of alligator gar which were stacked up like cord wood. My father spotted a water moccasin on the other bank and I took my .22 mag, aimed behind the head, shot and took its head clean off. We started up again and after many more miles saw a sign "" XXX XXXXX Site."" We arrived in the early afternoon. The two cottages turned out to be two houses. Each identical and 2 stories high. The developers had a drive made by dumping a pad of coarse gravel, about 2.5 to 3 feet high, about 300 yeards back into the swamp. At the end, and right, of each drive was a big square of gravel the houses were built on. This was going to be more than a 2 day job. We started taping the houses. While I was working I could hear something rummaging around out in the bush. I couldn't see anything but there was a strong odor similar to the pig farm next to my grandfather's farm (in Ohio). XXXXX XXXXXX had a reputation as being a boar hunter and I assumed it was a boar. We worked till dark and cleaned and packed up our tools. I had Dad start a camp fire on the part of the drive that went past the house (you had to do a 3 point turn in the car port area to turn around). I set up the cots and put on my holster and .22 mag revolver (just in case we encountered a charging boar). Dad brougt a slab of bacon (his idea of camp food). Oh well, he was doing the cooking. It smelled good too. One thing about Dad, he's  a master chef when it comes to ruff grub. We ate bacon and beans and home fries and then sat around the fire talking. The whole time I kept hearing the rummaging around in the everglades. The sound seemed to be getting nearer. It occurred to me if it were a wild boar, or anthing as larges as the sounds indicated, the .22 mag probably wouldn't be too effective. I decided to go get one of the carbines. As I stood up and started to go to the wagon I turned and saw two eyes staring from about 20 foot away. First thougt... an owl. But then I realized what I was looking at. I froze in my tracks. Next thought a bear. Only I was staring level in its eyes. I was on a gravel pad about 2.5 to 3 foot higher than it was. I am 5 foot 6 inches. My God... it was 8 to 9 foot tall. My hand went for my gun. I drew it and was going to fire. Only I realized if I shot this thing all I was going to do was really piss it off. Also, it wasn't acting threatening. It was just watching. It had a face more human than a bear or ape. Closer to an Australian aborriginal. I could also see its skin. It didn't have thick fur. It had sparse, long and whispy like strands. The hair was more like an orangutan. Only these were things I put together later. At the time I was just plain scared. As a Viet Nam verteran, with a purple heart, I wasn't overscared either. Let just say I had a strong sense of self preservation. I made a bee line for the house and momentarilly thought about stopping to get the carbine from the wagon. However, my feet took me into the house and up the stairwell. My Dad was hot on my heels. I went to the window which faced the camp fire. As I looked out the window I asked Dad, who was across the room, ""Did you see that?"" He said, ""No."" I told him, ""then what the heck were you running for?"" He said, ""I saw you draw your gun, then didn't shoot and then run off. I figured you had a good reason."" I told him, ""we need the carbines. You go out and get them and I will cover you."" He wouldn't do it. Still looking out the window I noticed we left the slab of bacon on a log near the camp fire. Then I saw it come out of the brush. I told Dad, ""There it is. Come over here and look at it."" He woudln't do it. I don't know if he could have got across the room in time any way. It crossed the viewable area, may 100 ft. in a few strides. As it walked it scooped up the slab of bacon. It didn't really bend over. It just dropped a shoulder slightly. It was walking upright the whole time. I might add it was walking, not running. It was casually strolling as if it didn't have a care in the world. It dawned on me that it didn't mean any harm. It justed wanted the bacon. Anyway I went to the wagon and got the carbines. Even though I wasn't sure what I saw and I concluded it didn't mean any harm I wasn't taking any chances. I told Dad we were going to take two hour watches. He decided to sleep first. I woke him up in two hours and told him to awaken me in two hours. I woke up in the morning and he was fast asleep. Whatever it was could have had us. If it had wanted to. The doors had not been installed yet. I went out and looked for tracks. Nothing on the gravel. I didn't expect any. I climbed down to the ground. I thought it would be soft. It was dry and there was a thick pad of pine needles. There were a few scruffed places but the distance between them looked too far apart to be foot steps. I thought about venturing out and looking for a soft spot but at the time I wasn't trying to prove anything but to myself. If my Dad wasn't such a chicken, and had seen it, then I would have been more resolved to look further. Only now I was beginning to wonder if I had imagined the whole thing. I really didn't make the connection until a few weeks after I came home and there was a newspaper article about Sasquatch sightings in the area I had been in. I just made a mental note to ask if any circus or zoo animals had escaped, in that area, and if so I would call and tell them what I saw. I am not relating this encounter to make you a true believer. At that time I know I saw something and this is a report on what I thought I saw. After 28 years I now question it myself. The more time that passes the sketchier the recollection is. I only offer this record in hopes it might help those who are seriously looking for it. I have one reservation. If this creature is real, and is it found, will that doom it to extinction?",I believe Alligator Alley is now called I-75.

"I was camping with family in the big cypress area near alligator alley april week of the 15th. I saw what i thought was a black shadow standing 8ft tall in the woods in front of me. I told my friend and turned my head. A few minutes later looked again and that black thing was gone and i was able to see through the forest. I shook the feeling off then that night is where it began. That night for dinner we cooked chicken legs and turkey meatballs over the fire. My brother left the garbage bag hanging 10 feet away from us and we went to bed. 4am I awoke hearing this strange sound in the far distance sounding 3 miles away. The sound came closer and closer to the point i knew it was heading towards my campsite. I woke up my ex-boyfriend, then my brother in another tent. I said do you hear that sound? they said yes be quiet. The sound was a wailing sound with a heavy breath at the end. I thought it was an alien and my ex thought it was a monster. The sound was horrible, and it got closer and closer to the camp. I heard it go by my tent and head in the direction of my brothers to the side of it, then left and went down a trail path behind our tents. I got up and wanted to look out of the tent window but my ex grabbed me and said are you crazy. The next morning we woke up and talked about it and began to trace the direction where the monster walked. I looked down and found a footprint in the sandy trail it looked like a huge foot both wide and long. Both guys put their foot in the print and it was way bigger than their foot in width and length couldnt be a persons foot. It looked like 4 big toes. This wasn't there the day before. We went up the trail and saw a few more of the prints. When we went home a guy friend of my cousins was interested in this phenomena so i went back with him and showed him where it occured and the footprint but it had slightly been messed up. He took picture but it didn't come out good. I wanted to go back again that year but my ex, brother, and cousin said no way. my cousin said she would have to bring a gun if she ever did go back. This strange happening scared them to death. I did go back with my kids and we were fine, no noises heard that night. I heard on the computer the noises of the skunk ape since the guy told me to listen and i couldn't believe it, it sounded a lot like what we had heard at the campsite. Hope you enjoyed the true story i just told you. I will be visiting it again sometime soon, i would rather not give the direct area since i don't want it to sell out when i need to camp.

"On the early morning of labor day a few of my friends and I decided that we would drive across the state of Florida, from Miami to Naples in hopes of surfing some of the swell that Hurricane Gustav was sending to Florida's Gulf Coast. At approximately 6:00A.M we left from Florida International University traveling west on the Tamiami Trail. The weather that day was relatively clear but as I mentioned we had a hurricane passing close to south Florida a few days earlier so everything was still quite humid and the winds were beginning to calm down at about 15 knots to the west. It was near the area of big cypress about 15 minutes from the worlds smallest post office, where the landscape had plenty of saw grass in shallow water and large trees at a distance of about a mile off the road where I saw a figure that seemed to be watching the road as we drove past. This creature was definitely not a person. I know that it was not a person because we had only seen about 5 cars in the entire length of the trip thus far. Whatever it was, it appeared to be large, at least the size of a person, but it was dark, with a wide body structure, and even from the distance at which I saw it (maybe 300-500 yards) it looked as if it was covered in hair. The creature was standing next to a palmetto, and we passed it quite quickly. about 10 seconds after we passed it It came to my attention that I should probably tell my friend to turn the car around to see if I could get a better look. We stopped, drove back to the site, and It was gone. But as I got down from the car there was a very strange smell in the air that was nothing like I had ever smelled before, almost like a wet dog that had been covered in eggs. My guess was that maybe the creature had crossed the road, heard our car and checked us out, and that it realized that it did not like us so much and simply crouched down and hid. Nobody else in the car saw the creature, I was sitting in the back seat on the passenger side, the front seat passenger was asleep and the driver was simply concentrating on the road. I only saw this thing for a few seconds but it left quite an impression on me. Before this I thought that stories about Bigfoot were interesting but I would dismiss them saying that I would believe it when I would see it. But after seeing how remote this area was and how large the Everglades really are, I am now certain that there is a possibility that there is something out there.Thank you for responding to my report and feel free to give me a call at your convenience, if I do not pick up the phone it is probably because I am in class so leave me a message and I will contact you as soon as I can.

"I have a sighting and other occurences to report. Its been about 3 years now since my friend Dan and I saw it. We were walking along a dirt/road trail along the focka canal system to find a good bass spot, as we were walking I thought I saw large brownish colored legs ahead on the trail. I didnt say anything at first until Dan asked me if I saw that. I was stunned and replied ""Yea, Huge brown legs cross in front of us and he replied "" I thought it was just my eyes"". The sasquatch was in a group of trees next to the canal I guess checking us out. The reason I am saying this is because we heard and saw the branches in front of us russling. We were honestly scared and backed away slowly. Now Dan is a officer in the Navy now working I believe out of Miami. He is a very credible none bs type of person. I myself is a biologist and I am super observent of my surroundings. The only reason why we just saw the legs is because we were looking down in front of us so we didnt step on one of the resident water moccasins. Since then I have been going to the same location to try to see if ""its"" still there and yes ""it"" is. I havent seen it since the first time but I found an area off the trail that had almost like I guess beds?!? Basically it was long saw grass bundled up together and it was obvious something large has sat in it. Also near by I found skelatal remains and hair from a bear that seemed to literally have been ripped in half. I have also spent many nights fishing in the location and near it and have heard undeniable 'calls"" that seem like it came from some sort of primate. Similar to a very deep howler monkey call.  I have a lot of experience with primates from my studies throughout Latin America. Based on that I KNOW it was a primate call. There was another occurence when I was with my friend Chris on Turner River Rd. off Rt.41 South of Ochopee,Fl. We were crawfish hunting after a evening shower and heard some odd noises in the woods across the canal system. Then we smelt a very odd odor I wouldnt say it smelt like rotten eggs like all the other reports but maybe like methane gas. We moved on about 2 miles down the road and was picking more crawfish out of the swamp and heard the same noises followed by the same smell. This occured for another 30 minutes or so and we felt uncomfortable and left. I believe I read that the BFRO went to Florida in 08 on an investigation and I believe it was off Rt.41? I think there is a few key locations that BFRO should check out, 1. Picayune Strand, just outside of Naples, Fl, http://www.fl-dof.com/state_forests/picayune_strand.html, 2. Turner River and Birdon Rds. just south of Ochopee, Fl off Rt. 41 http://www.staynplay.net/florida-tourism-articles/turner-river-road.htm I live in New Jersey but have a condo in Naples,Fl, if BFRO wants to investigate these areas I believe I can find time to come down and show you the exact spots of the occurences.

"About this time 2 years ago, two of my friends and I were staying in my dads old trailer right off James Road, Naples Fl. It was around 9:30 p.m., when we started hearing what sounded like wolf howls. The howling become a bit terrifying when we noticed it was getting closer. We then began howling back at it, when we realized we were caught right in between these things communicating. By this time it was already 11:00 p.m., around this time small pebbles began being hurled at us from a distance. It reached such a freaky level when whatever was in the woods just 30 ft. from us was stomping and grunting at us. For some reason at some point we thought for sure it was a prank and began throwing pieces of wood and rocks, when all of a sudden a horrible silence came over us. With none of us wanting to admit we were freaking out, we suddenly mad dashed for the trailer and hid in my dad's room (end of the trailer, pointing to the woods). Trying to play it off we tried sleeping huddled together like a can of sardines. We were overcome by tears and in a frozen like state. Knocking and grunting was all we heard for about an hour, until we gave our position in the trailer when my friend whispered to me to look out the window. For the final time a deep silence overcame outside. I slightly lifted one of the curtain blinds (not sure what their called, but there a series or levers that lift and tilt depending on how you pull or twist the small stick). When I looked out, not fearing due to the fact there were no lights on in the trailer, I saw nothing but what seemed to be my reflection in the glass, I thought I had confirmed it when I tilted my head and my supposed reflection did the same. When I released the blind and was asked what I saw, I told them it was my reflection. I waited about 4 minutes, in which seemed like a millenium, I opened the blinds, I saw nothing but branches and brush. I remember slowly dropping the blind and crying myself to sleep in a way my friends wouldn't hear me. I can't explain why, but whatever was looking back at me through that window could've easily killed me considering the trailer was on an incline and bricks due to the jacks breaking. I would love to go back, which is crazy on my behalf but its alluring. I would submit to a polygraph in a heart beat to get someone out there with me.",We started in the back yard then walked a few blocks to the edge of the woods.,Collier County,Florida,Spring,Report 39382: Frightening encounter experienced on family property outside Naples,26.03808,-81.64948,4/15/2010,39382,Class B,dhtunh0dv1,81.23,71.815,62.4,59.35,0.67,0.11,0.04,0,0,,1022.34,Clear throughout the day.,10,9.33,69,7.57
"Sunday, March 11, 2012 shortly past midnight. We were camping in a primitive campsite at Bear Island, Big Cypress Preserve in Collier County Florida. This campsite is off of ORV trails, meaning only off-road vehicles with permits may enter this area. It was a warm evening after a late afternoon rain shower. We had a camp fire burning, there were five of us at camp that night along with two Jeeps parked away from campsite. After sitting near the campsite I wanted to retrieve my charging cell phone from my Jeep. As i walked away from the camp and into the darkness of the night, I reached my Jeep, as I was opening the door, I had a feeling someone was watching me. I looked to my left and about 15' into the woods I saw a pair of glowing yellow, human shaped eyes staring back at me. I am 6'6"" tall, and these eyes were level with me, possibly a few inches upward. I could feel the eyes staring into mine, and I watched them blink, slow and deliberate, just like a human. The overwhelming odor was undeniable it smelled like a combination of skunk and wet dog. Every hair on my body stood up right, I had instant goosebumps from my head to toe, and every instinct told me to flee. Without hesitation I quickly returned to the campfire.....Telling everyone what I had just witnessed, and assuring them I was not joking, I gathered a spotlight and a companion and walked over to check it out, without a sound we crept up, and heard nothing. Shining the light into the woods we did not see any signs of an animal, no deer, no bear, no low branches for an owl to be perched on, just a bare spot in the woods where the eyes were coming from. I have watched shows where people talk of Bigfoot sightings, and I always question them. I say I would have chased that thing through the woods with a camera and a flashlight. but now I understand, when you do see something like this, its a combination of shock, fear, and instinct. I would not write in with this sighting if I didn't feel in my gut, and in my mind what I saw, was not something that SHOULD have been in those woods.I was reassured of my feelings this past weekend when we returned to camp in the same spot. We camped in the same location this past weekend. April 28th-29th 2012. Pink jeep number 7, Bear Island Campground, Big Cypress Preserve. This encounter however was not visual, but audible. We had a campfire, there were five of us sitting there. It was approx 10:15, when I playfully made a loud and long howl (Call) into the woods. However we all were astounded when I almost Instantly got a response. The howl, was not a coyote, it was not an owl, or a bear. And it was not a human playing along. The direction the sound came from, was also the direction I had seen the eyes in the woods previously. It is dense woods with no campsites, or foot access. Forward an hour in the future. Me and my daughter and wife are in our tent. My two friends are already asleep in theirs, staked out next to mine. The back of both of our tents are facing the opposite woods that we had heard the howl from. After being in our tents and laying down with the lights out. We were startled, by the loudest crashing sound coming from the woods behind us. It sounded like something just grabbed a tree, snapped it, and smacked part of it against itself. The sound was followed by a few footsteps, then silence. It was so loud and an unexpected sound it awoke the two friends in the tent next to us with a ""what the heck was that? "". My daughter was the first to notice the odor that was suddenly lingering. Her and my wife compared it to skunk, i thought it smelled more like wet dog, urine smell. Very similar to the odor I noticed previously with the eye incident. I did scout the area where we heard the noise, but could not see anything. No fallen trees, and no obvious damage from where I could access. It did start to rain in the area early in the am. So when we woke up, it had been raining for sometime.Making it harder to notice anything out of place. Am I 100% positive I saw Skunk Ape? No, but I am 100% positive there is something down here, and it could be just that. I do think some further investigation would be very beneficial.","Pink campsite #7 , Bear Island, Big Cypress Preserve, Collier County, FL",Collier County,Florida,Spring,Report 35218: Possible incidents at Bear Island Campground in Big Cypress National Preserve,25.889,-81.3215,3/11/2012,35218,Class B,dhw5m2zqre,85.5,75.19,64.88,64.66,0.77,,0.62,0,0,,,Clear throughout the day.,0,,92,3.84

"I was patroling an area near the University of North Florida, when something caught my attention on the side of the road. I turned around and went back to the spot to get a better look.

As I walked around and investigated the area I felt as if I was being watched. I heard some movement in the brush. I thought it may have been just an animal that I am used to. I tried to move to get a better look at what was in the brush. I never made a good visual. I found it strange that what ever it was did not flee. It was shadowing my movements and using the brush and lighting conditions to remain out of my sight.

"Right on the northwest corner of New World Ave. and Normandy Blvd. FSCJ owns approx. 135 acres. When things are slow I take our electric golf cart thru the woods just to look around and maybe spot wildlife as I go. Between the college and the city pool which is west of the college are numerous ponds, wetlands, and pine tree flats on forestry land. There are also alot of training areas left over from the Navy days and a few old roads that are similiar to power line right aways running mostly north and south. Now to the day in question: We were allowing a contractor to drive thru our property to gain access to the forestry land and I went to talk to them to get an update on the project. It turned out they were not working that day so I was riding around just looking for wildlife. I came up to one of the old roads and when I looked north on the road there was something in the road sitting on it's hunches and it appeared to have one arm in the air and the other was scratching it's side. I was traveling kind of fast and could not stop until I was about 10 feet past the road. I put the cart in reverse to back up and it was not in the road any longer. I looked just past the spot where it was in the road and it was on the side of the road and was bending down a limb from a 4 or 5 foot pine tree peering out at me. This lasted for maybe 3 or 4 seconds and it ran in from what I could tell was an upright position. The small pines hindered my view when it was running but I am fairly positive it was running up right. What ever it was, was about 2 maybe 3 foot tall judging by the trees and was very black and resembled a primate. I worked at the Jax Zoo in maintenance for a few years and one of the exhibits I was responsible for was the Great Apes so I am very familiar with several different primates and it reminded me very much of a bonobo. I was fairly shaken up and I did not go look for tracks, signs, or anything. Now to present, a few weeks ago forestry had a timber company thinning the pines in the same area, I went back there to talk to the job foreman as they were using our property to gain access. They were two or three hundred yards back in the woods and I did not want to drive my cart back there because of the road. I got maybe thirty yards off the road down the skidder trail and I am not sure what it was but the hair on my neck stood straight. I had a strong sense something was out there watching me. It may have been my imagination but I really believe I was being watched.",This is a close military base in an area rumored to have held nuclear arms.,Duval County,Florida,Summer,Report 26577: Brief daylight sighting of a small primate type creature in a pine forest near Jacksonville,30.25389,-81.8992,6/18/2009,26577,Class B,djmu07dcdm,84.47,78.295,72.12,73.85,0.86,0.61,0.85,0.0022,0.83,rain,1014.4,Humid and mostly cloudy throughout the day.,9,8.65,236,0.55
"This just happened to me about 5:15am this morning. I stepped out on the balcony of my second story apartment I'm in Atlantic Beach fl. I live about 3 to 5 min from Hannah park. I turned on the back porch light as I walked out.  I took about two or three steps out onto the balcony and I heard a loud screaching yell and then three woo whoo whoo noises. As I live and breathe that WAS the sound of a primate!! Immediately the dog in a fence of a neighbor's house right behind the apartment began barking like crazy for about 30 seconds and then stopped. It kind of freaked me out I thought, did an ape escape from Jax zoo or something? I crouched down a little on the balcony and watched the area. In about 5 min I could see the tree in the very back of the apartment back yard rustle a little and it was as if something was moving toward the fence. Then I heard two low grunts from the ground from inside the fence on the neighbors side. It is a privacy fence so I couldn't see what made the grunt.

"On Saturday, 11/21/09 I went squirrel hunting in the Escambia River Management Area in Escambia County Florida. I began to walk into the woods at approximately 6:00am. The area I chose to hunt is a section of woods bordering the river. As I was walking, I heard a low, guttural vocalization that sounded almost like a native american dialect, only in a much lower range than most people would speak in. It reminded me of the Samurai chatter that I have heard on your website and others. I heard the sounds for about 10 to 15 seconds, and then once again a few minutes later. On Wednesday, 11/25/09, my oldest daughter and I returned to the area to hunt squirrel. We hiked back into the woods for about a mile, and found a log to sit on amidst several promising looking trees with squirrel nests. On the way into the area, we walked a game trail and smelled that ""wet deer"" smell that you often encounter around white tails. Almost immediately upon arriving, my daughter asked if I heard what she did. I asked her what it sounded like, and she said it sounded like someone walking through the woods. I told her I did hear it, did she think it was a deer, or wild hog, or some other animal. She said ""no daddy, it sounds like a man walking"". I had noticed myself that the steps sounded bipedal. Upon leaving the area, I decided to take the opportunity to show her various signs of wildlife in the area. The game trail goes throught the middle of a small meadow. The meadow contained tracks from deer, wild hog, turkey, armidillo, racoon, etc.. There are many fallen logs in the area from hurricane Ivan a few years ago, and they have become prime locations for grubs to inhabit. This is probably why so many different types of animals are making use of the meadow. One track in particular caught our attention. It was the bare footprint of what appeared to be a large man, toe prints included. My size 13 boot is 16 inches in length, and this print was approximately an inch longer than my bootprint. The print was made in a soft mound around an ant bed. I placed my boot print in the mound as closely as I could. The surrounding ground was too hard for tracks to show. My daughter immediately assumed that it was a bigfoot track. There are stories of ""swamp boogers"" in this area, so it really did not surprise us. I took a photo with my cell phone, which as soon as I can figure out how to download to the computer, I will  be glad to provide. I put a 3"" shotgun shell in the print crossways to show the size. It was about 5"" wide in the heel, and closer to 7"" to 8"" broad just before the toes.r","Take U.S. 29 north from Cantonment, Fl. approximately 15 miles.

I was ""off trail"" approximately several hundred yards when I came upon an un-natural looking intertwined tree formation capped off with a dead ""y"" shaped branch weaved in the top.

I had been there about 45 minutes and had taken a break to drink some water when I heard a sound that I had never heard before, but knew for sure that whatever it was, had power behind it. It really got my attention since I was alone at the time.  I listenned for about 2 more minutes and I heard the sound again much clearer and could tell that it seemed to be coming down towards the lake.  The lake can't be seen from the house.  This creature called Bigfoot automatically came to my mind because I knew it had to be powerful to produce that sound.  I left immediately because I was frightened and came home to look on the internet for bigfoot sounds.  I found on the Oregon Bigfoot site the sound.  the first 2 screams on the ""Puyallup Screamer"" file is exactly what I heard.  I told my cousin's roommate that I had heard something and she said immediately that I should talk to my cousin because she had heard it too.",,Upson County,Georgia,Summer,Report 9001: Possible howls heard near Thomaston,32.80865,-84.25755,7/15/2004,9001,Class B,dju4dsts0z,90.73,79.03,67.33,72.93,0.74,0.19,0.94,,,rain,,Humid throughout the day and mostly cloudy in the afternoon.,10,10,321,4.75
"I was hiking the Appalachian Trail in July of 2005 and I stopped to spend the night at the Gooch Mountain shelter.   There was a hiker there at 16:00 but he left around 18:00 to get in a few more miles. It was a normal night on the AT until around 2:30 in the morning. I was awakened by a very heavy rustling sound. I immediately jumped up in the sleeping bag thinking it was a bear. I was sleeping in the loft upstairs, for just this reason, and I had seen a bear earlier that day. When I shined my headlamp out the front of the shelter there came a tremendous whooping sound. It was a mmoooooopp. It was pitch dark and dead silent except for this tremendous whoop. I was almost painful to the ears it was so loud. I could not see anything. The sound seemed to be about 50 feet away and moved from left to right out of range of my headlamp repeating this loud whoop. There were no other sounds in the woods, nothing, not even the crickets or frogs until 3 or 4 minutes after the sound stopped. I did not sleep the rest of the night. I looked in the morning and found no evidence of a bear, raccoon, or other animal, but the ground was very hard and dry. The sound came from the area where I had my food hanging in a tree away from the shelter. I am a big guy, ex-military and spend a lot of time hiking and surviving in the woods. I have never heard anything close to this sound from any animal I have ever encountered. I do not scare easy but this had me really shaken. I watched a show on The Discovery Channel (I think) a while back and they played a supposed recording of a Bigfoot, then I realized this was exactly what I heard.

The sounds sound like something screeming. But kind of high pitched screems. My friend also thought he heard somthing throwing stuff around his treestand.

Two friends of mine and myself were pushing a cave lead in Cornfield Sink on the east side of Pigeon Mountain. We came out of the lead at about 3:00AM and started gathering our caving gear together for the 1/2 mile walk to the car. As we are about to leave the strangest call I have ever heard came from the opposite side of the sink from us. Distance would have been about 900'. The three of us have been woodsmen all our lives but none of us had ever heard a call like that. It sounded like four different animals in one. All powered by what must have been an enormous set of lungs! Hearing the vocalization the three of us looked at each other saucer eyed not saying a word. Each of us was hoping the others would pipe up with a logical explanation for what we had heard.

"It was June 15 1997, Father's Day.  My friends and I had been rock climbing at Raven Cliff Falls in the Chattahoochee National Forest outside of Helen, Georgia.  After climbing all day Friday and Saturday morning, a rain storm made us pull down our rigging and head out of the woods.  We drove down to Helen and walked around until around 5:00 pm.  We filled up the truck and headed back up towards Raven Cliff to find a camp site for the night.  We found a small dirt road that had been barricaded with a large dirt birm.  We drove over the birm and drove into the forest.  We drove until we had a half tank of gas which put us several miles back in.  Around 11:00 or 11:30 pm, we found a small clearing and decided to stop and make camp.  Once we exited our truck, we found a shallow hole that was about three to four feet in diameter that appeared to be an old fire pit.  It had a large log laying on one side of it.  We gathered wood for a fire and began to set up camp.  Since the weather was nice, we decided to not to mess with tents and hammocks.  After about thirty minutes of laying down, I heard a noise in the tree line on the left side of our camp.  It sounded like an animal moving through the brush.  I dismissed it and tried to go back to sleep.  I continued to hear the noise for several minutes.  I have spent alot of time in the woods hiking and camping.  The next thing I heard was like nothing I had ever heard before.  I heard a grunt and then a scream that did not sound like any other animal.  It sounded like it came from maybe fifty to a hundred yards away.  I asked what it was and my friends did not have an answer.  We began kidding saying that we were out a good way and it could be a sasquatch.  I did not go to sleep for awhile after the scream.  Finally, I drifted asleep and slept until day break.  As we got up to get our gear packed, we noticed prints next to the fire pit that none of us had ever scene before.  They definitely were not human, but were to big for any animal known to be in indigenous to that area.  We quickly loaded up and left the area.",The dirt road was on the left hand side of the road before you get to the trail head of Raven Cliff Falls.

"I was sitting on my couch watching tv with my small dogs around me. My male Yorkie saw it when I did out our back door. It was sitll daylight. I thought it was a man at first, but it was too large, too dark, and fleeting. The dog jumped up and ran to the back door but I moved slowly over there, being a little frightened. When I looked out the door it was gone. My first impression of it being a man was because of the general shape, but the dark figure wasn't wearing clothes and had to be over 10ft. tall to see it through the dorway like I did. I was able to see the upper body from where I was sitting. The porch drops off with a stairway to the patio around the pool. That's where it was walking rappidly next to the house. By the time I got to the door to look out it was over the fence and gone. My instinct was to check the gate and I saw it was still latched and locked, never having been opened. It wasn't a human it was too large. It wasn't a bear it was running upright. I can't come up with any other thing that could be that tall and that could do what it did.

"It was about 11pm and we just laid down to sleep. We were staying in a cabin that we had rented for the weekend. I heard this high pitched horrific scream/howl. It was close. It was not some faint, distant sound. It was very clear and close. My first thought was a woman in distress. Then, about 20 seconds later, I heard it again. I also heard dogs barking above me, higher up the ridge. This time I realized it was probably not a human. This sound was a forceful, deliberate, high pitched reverberating scream/howl. Because I was inside the cabin, it is hard to tell how far away this was. I would guess within 750 feet. Perhaps as close as 200 feet. The scream/howl continued about four/five more times, repeating about every 15-25 seconds. I have military and hunting experience and have never heard such a sound. I cannot think of an animal that could make this type of sound. I will never forget it, that's for sure.","Go through Helen. Turn left on Alt. 75, just past flea market.

"Bigfoot sighting. Late March or early April, 2009.  Approximately 1815 hours. I was southbound on GA75 between Helen and Cleveland, GA about .2 of a mile north of Duncan Bridge, (Hwy 384). As I rounded a bend I saw something getting ready to cross the road from east to west. As I slowed my first thought was that someone was dressed in a costume, but I dismissed that idea because every pickup around here had a shotgun in the back window and a good percentage, like myself, had a gun in the car. When he heard me he stopped on the shoulder. He did not look at me for a few seconds, but then slowly he turned toward me, looked, then continued to turn 180 degrees and walk into the woods. I was unable to pull off to the shoulder and park because of hay bales and plastic used to stop erosion.  Traffic was backing up behind me so I drove to Duncan Bridge then left on a private road, with the hope of seeing him again. No luck. What I saw. He appeared to be 6 foot 2 to 6 foot 4. He was standing erect but had a slightly hollow chest. His legs and torso seemed normal (as compared to a human) but his arms were longer. His fur was full and sleek. It had a shine to it. A medium to light brown. He looked healthy. It was his eyes that I remember most. He looked at me with an  intelligence that you don't see in an animal.

I was driving home with him in the car and he was asleep from the painkillers he was on due to his burns. I had my highbeams on and was going ~45mph down SR-16 eastbound near Starke/Camp Blanding.

I noticed its face was very flat, with no snout or jawline, but with hair all around it.

Once it stood up it looked to be about 6 foot tall. Once it crossed the road it kept on running into the woods and never slowed down.

"I was driving down state road at 9pm on 9/17/11. This road is good for heavy traffic and none at all. At the time I was the only car on the road going both directions.  I was headed south towards state road 528. 407 runs adjacent to the Canaveral marsh lands full of deer, hogs, birds and plenty of other native wild life. at 9:10 or so I saw what appeared to be a skunk ape cross the road right in front of me.  This road fits one car in each direction. The skunk ape appeared to be running because it crossed the road in 2 step very easily. After the second step it jumped down into the side embankment and into the bushes next to the road.  I did get a good look at it since I driving at a pace to avoid hitting deer that cross the road frequently. The animal had long hair all over its body. Especially on the arms and shoulders. This is the reason I know it was in a sprint. The hair was flowing like it would if it was blowing in the wind. The color of the hair seemed to be dark. Reflecting against my head lights and the moon light I really couldn't tell the color. It had a cone shaped head, Very longs arms. When it jumped down into the embankment the arms went up in the air as to help keep its balance or not hit anything .  I saw the side profile of the face. The face was dark ( again night time ) it seemed ape like. The feet where huge. as it took steps I noticed how large they were.  The over all body seemed very THICK. The animal was very muscular. From the side view I had , you could see just how thick of a body it was. I didn't stop to investigate due to the face that it was night time and I did not want to have a face to face with what ever I saw alone on a dark road. Thinking about the situation as it constantly replayed in my mind . I think it might have been in pursuit of a deer. I constantly see deer on that road at night into the early morning.

"Back in 1985-86 my family relocated to Coral Springs from Miami before the Sawgrass Express way was built. We lived so close to the Glades my friends and I used to ride our skateboards to the levy and watch the Everglades burn (at that time, some firebug had set quite a blaze). On some mornings we'd wake to cars and yards covered in ash. Needless to say, a lot of wildlife began to migrate closer to our neighborhood i.e.,deer,alligators, whatever. One night we pitched a tent in my friends back yard approx.  50 yrds from a canal that separated us from an apartment complex and across from that was the beginning of the everglades. The fires had been raging for weeks and people in the area were reporting missing pets, some of which were inside 6 foot privacy fences. We used to run between houses to cut through to go home. This night in particular, before we called it quits, we played a bit of hide and seek. I remeber hiding under a window box behind a bush and got spotted by an unmarked police car. We really thought we were in trouble, but the police were looking for a person that had been peeping in windows. We assured the police we weren't the perps and went on about our business and went to the tent. 3 kids in a tent don't sleep well, so we were having fun cracking jokes and noticed a sound coming from across the canal approx 100 yrds away. Something was slamming the dumpster lids in the complex across the way and making low deep sounds, grunts. These were tall dumpsters. You'd have to get a boost to lift the lid. We got real quiet trying to listen to figure what it could be. At first we figured a cow got loose and possibly was bumping into the dumpster. But, it became evident that wasn't so. One of the kids I was with turned on a flashlight and started making shadow puppets with his E.T. stuffed animal. Then the thing from across the canal took notice of us for the first time. The grunts were still audible but with what I would say is with a hint of curiosity. We got quiet and real concerned putting 2 and 2 together. Could this be what the police were looking for? The steps grew closer and closer. I remember we tried to figure if it was a quadraped or biped. When the steps finally stopped, the breathing grew louder, then SPLASH!!! Whatever it was was 50 yrds from us and coming right in our direction. We sprinted for the house waking up my friend's family. They were woken by 3 screaming kids at 2a.m. exclaiming something is out there. His dad grabbed his shotgun, turned on the flood lights.  He went out to look around and found the tent was demolished and covered in water. I swear I could feel this thing  right around the corner in the shadows looking right at us. We did not let his father investigate further until morning and couldn't beleive the tent had been moved from its postion. I have no doubt had we stayed in that tent this story would be much different, if at all.

"I lived in Burnt Hickory Estates off of Hwy 61 in a 2 story house with my mother, sister, step-father. We had over 125 acres in the back yard nothing but woods. The woods were covered in trees and little creeks. Me and my friends always played in the woods. For years we would find crazy things out there that just didn't make sense like trees bent over and I remember a big hole like 20 feet deep maybe 40 feet wide round. We called it the hole. Well we decided to transport our horses behind our house so we cut down about 4 acres of trees, leveled it off and built a barn and fenced the area in. About 5 months later after everything was built and finished I would get bored and I would go in the pasture and hang out with the horses, feeding them just hanging out. I have 3 horses: Rambo, a Tennessee Walker, all black and 17 hands high. Reno, a Blanket Apaloosa, grey/white, 12 hands high. And Dakota, a Morgan red tone, 13 hands high. I was in the pasture standing by my horses Rambo and Reno. The pasture had a barn in the far back, in the right corner.  As I'm standing by Reno and Rambo I heard some movement in the brush to my right. To the left of the barn about 40 yards from me as I turned and looked, my horses Reno and Rambo spooked and ran toward my house away from the barn. As I look at this thing, I could only see the left front side of it facing me, hidden in the brush. The color was a red auburn. I thought, what is Dakota doing? Then I realize this thing is outside of the fence. I thought Dakota got out so as I walk toward what I thought was my horse, Dakota. At that time, Dakota runs out of the barn beside me and runs to the house. At that point I froze and the hair stood up on my neck. This up-right walking figure stepped to its left, made a grunt sound/breathing, looked right at me then turned pushing small trees and brush over and taking off into the woods. It was about 8 1/2 feet tall, massive in size and covered in red hair. The thing I call Bigfoot was ripped, very strong. As it took off you could hear the foot steps, very heavy. I ran towards the house and told my mom and everyone just looked at me like I was crazy. So I kept it to myself. This is my first sighting. Then about 9 months ago in 2012 I had another sighting. I'm about to write that sighting next.",Off of Hwy 61 in Dallas Georgia in Paulding County. In Burnt Hickory Estates Stephen Court.

"It was 2:35 in the morning on July 26, 2006. I recieved a call from my dad which alone is very unusual to say the least. He started by saying ""you are not going to  believe  what i just saw"". He said he steped out onto his porch(which  wraps around his house) to sit in his chair and have a smoke. He got about half way through with it when he said he heard the most terrifying sound ever. He  stepped in the door and grabbed a MAG light to take a look and when he did he saw a sillouette of a bipedal creature approx 8 foot tall and 75 yards away stand up near the pond and quickly run towards the neibors house which is to the right and behind him. At this point my dad is completely freaked out. He hears the loud moan again 3 more times each time getting softer in the distance. He then wakes my mother (who thinks he just lost his marbles) and she comes outside with him. She also hears the moan and a gun shot approx the same distance away but at this point it is an estimatted 1 mile away. This is when  he calls me and describes what happened. I get in my truck and go overe to their house to take a look around with him. Whatever it was is long gone by the time i get there and we just look  around to put both  my mom and dad somewhat at ease.

"I think I might have seen a big foot on May 30, 2012.  I went outside to put my trash can at the street at about midnight. The only light was the porch lights on the house behind us.  When I walked around the corner of the house, I froze because I saw what looked like something standing at my neighbor's fence. They have a fence that is fenced in on three sides, just not at the front of the house, and what I saw was standing at the back of the fence, I think on my side of the fence, but not sure. All I could see was the silhouette of a person/thing, but it stood 1 1/2 to 2 feet over the top of the fence. All I could see was the silhouette of the shoulders and head and hair sticking up over the fence. It had long hair and it was not really moving.  Only the hair would move. At first I thought it was a person who had stopped and stood still when it saw me.  Then I realized it was way too big to be a person.  I admittedly have bad eyesight though, even with glasses on at night. On top of that I am a logical person with a master's degree, so I don't rush to conclusions, especially fanciful ones.  So I told myself it was just the shadows and light playing tricks on me.  I figured that something was propped up against the fence and just looked like a head and shoulders in the dark and that maybe the hair was some spanish moss caught on whatever it was. But I still felt uneasy and ran inside as fast as I could.  The next day (today) I went outside and looked for whatever it was that might have looked like a head and shoulders. But there as nothing there.  No plants, no trees, nothing propped up against the fence, no spanish moss, just a fence.  We went back outside tonight to look again and see if there was anything casting a funky shadow.  While that corner of the yard is dark and lights barely shine there from the windows, there was definitely nothing taller than the fence and nothing that looked like a head and shoulders. I would estimate, given that the fence is about 6 feet tall, that it was at least 7 1/2 to 8 1/2 feet tall.  It was broad shouldered. And it had long hair or fur on it's head.  I am not saying it was a bigfoot, because I could not see it well enough to say that for certain, but I don't think it was a person. If it was a person it was a very large, very tall, very hairy person.  Also, when I came back inside, my dog (a lab/border collie mix who is about 90 lbs) started growling.  He kept growling until I let him out of his kennel and he immediately ran to my back door.  I let him outside and he shot off.  Our yard is fenced in so he cannot leave the yard.  But ten minutes later when I went to let him back in, he wasn't near the back door. It took several minutes for him to come back to the door after I called repeatedly.  That is not like him.  He usually is begging to come back inside and doesn't hesitate when I call him.  After that he was very restless all night.",It was in a residential neighborhood.  Huntingdon Subdivision.

"Three years ago I was up in the Cohutta Wilderness in N Georgia doing some hiking and fishing by myself. I set up camp at the remnants of an old logging camp, basically just a clearing. It was right next to a small river called the Conasauga river. As soon as I started setting up camp I started hearing what sounded like a big thick stick repeatedly getting wrapped against a tree. I don't remember how many times it was but I remember it going on for a minute or two. I low crawled down to the river and peeked out from under some trees and looked upriver where the sound was coming from but did not see anything. The sound stopped and I went back and finished setting up camp. After I set up I waded across the stream and went to where I thought the sound came from and found nothing but a bunch of beaver chewed trees. When I saw those chewed trees I attributed the noise to them. After that my entire trip there was quiet.

"It was roughly around the end of August 2011 and I was at my mothers house. The house is located in the Burnt Hickory area of Paulding County, GA. She lives in a subdivision but it is still out in the country. I have always been and still a night owl. I stepped out on her back deck around 0200 in the morning to have a cigarette. Behind her house is nothing but trees, shrubs, hills, and creeks. There is an abundance of wildlife in the area that range from deer to coyotes. I was a Reconnaissance Marine for 8 years with multiple deployments to both Iraq and Afghanistan. I have been to numerous survival schools all over America from Maine to California. Most of my life was spent in the woods and I understand what animals make what sounds. I do not unnerve very easily. So back to my story. I was on the back deck smoking a cigarette when I heard this loud howl/scream. The first howl grabbed my attention instantly. Because I had only heard it one time I was unsure what it was. So I listened with a bit more interest the second time and I was trying to run everything through my mind to to figure out what it was. I knew it was not a deer or coyote because the howl was so deep. So then I started to think about my surroundings. There is a highway a couple miles away so I thought it may have been a big rig/semi. Then I heard it again. That option was completely ruled out. So I started to think of what else it could be. Perhaps it was a generator running in the woods. Again I heard the howl. Not a generator! I had run through so many different scenarios that I was starting to get freaked out. The howl was from a living creature and it was much larger than I. Each howl lasted approx. 5 seconds with a 10-15 second rest before the next. I stood out there for about 5 minutes before listening to this before I was to freaked and headed inside. I immediately ran up to my computer and googled howling sounds in Paulding County, GA. There were several websites regarding howling in the area but most of them were referring to Picketts Mill Battlefield. Then I came across BFRO. Initially I was like ""yeah...okay!"". I started looking through the website and I came across some of the audio submissions from Ohio. Once I heard it I nearly crapped my pants. That howl was to a T of what I heard. The only difference was mine sounded much deeper, closer, and I didn't have dogs barking in the background. I still get goosebumps thinking about it. I read through some of the other posts from Paulding County and Bartow County. What they all had to say was pretty freaky. Then I looked at the time frames they were made and where. During those time frames there was construction in the area. And when I heard my sounds they had just recently begun construction in the area. Not sure if there is any connection with that. I did bring it up to my wife the next day and she could hear the fear in my voice as I talked about it.

"I was driving on Old Cartersville road towards HWY 61 just past the chicken farm but before the pond.  I had my 13 year old son with me. I saw what I thought was a bear crouched down on the right side of the road. I turned to tell my son to look at the bear. My son was in the back seat. Before I could turn back around all the way. I noticed it stood up on two legs. My son was asking what it was. Then I noticed it was over 7 foot 6 inches tall covered in long black hair. It was burley! It was all of 500-600 pounds. It was no more than 20-30 yards outside our truck window.  It was so large I could see its muscles in its legs (thighs). Its head appeared to sit on its shoulders like it had no neck. The head looked like it came to a point. It looked like a bipedal ape! It had something white in its hand! That's when it registered it had hands and not claws. The arms were longer than any human arms. They seemed to stretch closer to the knee area. When it walked the knees worked perfectly. It did not have a bow legged affect. Which made it seem human but it looked like an ape. It started to move towards the road walking on two legs. My lights stayed on it. It seemed to want out of my lights. When it walked for the road it was headed in the path of my truck. I was on a small curve. So my lights followed it. I hit my fog lights & it turned back from the direction it came. It picked up speed and started to run still on two legs. I could see the foot falls & the thigh muscles bounce. Also saw butt muscles flex all under the hair. It started moving so fast the white thing in its hand was almost a blur. The next day, I returned to the area. Where it ran off into the woods was uphill.

"Last year during the summer my wife and I were leaving work. We were riding together in my car leaving the Cedartown Ga airport where we skydive.

Old Rockmart Rd is the back way home about 15 miles long surrounded by woods, trees, fields, and pastures. My wife and I were talking back and forth about the day just driving home. Its starting to get dark and as we come to a straight away about a half a mile long with pastures on both sides of us fenced in, I see something big and black in front of us about 10 to 20 yards in my lane of the road I thought it was a cow so i slammed on the brakes at that time this figure (BIGFOOT) stood up from a crouched position standing about 8ft tall with long black hair turned and looked at us. I think the brakes squealing scared it, but it looked at us, the lights shined right on him. He covered his face from the head lights, he took about 2 steps into the side of the road where there was a fence post about 5 to 6 feet tall, put his left hand on the fence post and easily hopped over the fence and took off. Our windows were down, it made no sound plus couldn't hear over the sound of the car. But I could smell something dead or garbage, it smelled bad. He was about 8 feet tall and way bigger than a cow. But this was not a cow, I know what I saw, he was on two feet walking and hopped a fence and ran toward the woods. I was shocked at what I saw and so was my wife.

We found no foot prints but the brush had obviously been disturbed, there were also several stones by the side of both tents that seemed to have been thrown there. Although we had planned to stay another night, we left promptly after I shared my story with everyone.",You can find it.

"It had to be July of 96, on a Sunday. It was the month of the ""blue moon"". Myself, a friend and my 17 year old son was going fishing at yellow jacket creek in West Point Georgia. I felt we needed to cut our all night fishing trip short, it was an urgent feeling I had, and knew we had to go. We were leaving the park about 12:00-1:00 A.M. There wasn't any lights on the long road and we were the only ones out that time of night. We were in a Mitsubishi truck pulling a med size boat, needless to say, we couldn't go too fast. I'd say about 20 to 25 miles and hour at best. My friend and I saw something in the headlights and shouted ""a deer!"" At first Bud (my friend) thought it was a deer,  but I could tell it was much bigger and was slowing down to get a better look. He was approx. 8 feet tall and was about the color of a deer. He was walking upright with long strides, his arms hung down to his knees, and his head was extremely large. It looked to me like his head was bigger than it should have been. He had sharp pointy features and darker hair was on the top of his head and down the back of his neck, spreading across his shoulders to about the shoulder blades and fading out. The rest of his hair was lighter in color and was close to the skin, like a deer. He walked on the right side of the road and as we approched, he veered off the shoulder of the road and eased off in the ditch, where he reached up and grabbed a mimosa tree limb, pulled it down as if to hide his face from us. We both could see him from his shoulders down. I seen his ribs, the muscles in his hips and thighs, and legs, and partly his back. That's when I seen the hair fade into short close hair. I remember in detail, his face was distorted almost, and darker. The cheek bones were almost spikey, (for lack of a better word). Bud and I don't hate each other, but we are not the best of friends but he will verify everything, and, no, we were not drinking or doing drugs of any kind. It was a Sunday, and it was a full moon, the month of a blue moon. Bud said it had to be a werewolf for the longest, till I said it had to be bigfoot.","Yellow Jacket Creek..... there is a little store at the entrance and it is about 1 to 2 miles to the lake... Bud could tell you more about the road numbers and names.  I can get Bud's phone number for you to talk to him. You can call me if you'd like. Just let me know. I have tried off and on for the last few years to get some one and tell them what we saw, with no luck.  I tried to call a 1-800 # and it was no longer in service and had to let it go. But it DID happen and I know what I saw. There is also an elderly man in Tucker Ga. who as a young adult was hunting around Yellow Jacket Creek and he made his sister bring him to me, an hour's ride, so we could talk about it. Said no one belived him and he was afraid to tell it. As we talked he started to cry. He had to be 80 at this time but said he remembered it in detail and was so glad that someone else had seen it, that he KNEW he wasn't crazy. This stays on my mind and I hope to hear from someone.

"My family has an 800 acre farm in Haralson County, GA.  Our farm is on the border of Paulding County, GA., near the small ""town"" of Draketown (it's more of a settlement than a town).  We typically spend about one weekend out of the month at our farm where we have a nice cabin (house).  The land consists of pasture (no cattle), pines, hardwoods, swamp, and five pretty large lakes.  Whenever we are down there we go spotlighting at night to look at deer.  We don't hunt the deer on our land and usually see 50-80 deer a night just riding around and looking at them.  Being only about 1.5 hours from Atlanta this area is EXTREMELY remote and secluded.  It's all private land and not much activity occurs around there. During this past Christmas holiday there were 6 adults in our group in a Suburban riding down the dirt roads through our farm after a cookout at the cabin.  As we neared the main pasture near our barn where we feed corn to the deer we were puzzled to see a large herd of deer ""flying"" out of the pasture into the hardwoods.  This was shocking because they know that headlights mean new corn and they usually stand around waiting on the new feed.  As we rounded the bend that opens up into the pasture we saw a large, ""black"", two-legged creature cross the dirt road, see our lights, and then turn around and enter the heavy pines it had entered the road from.  We have no idea what we saw and don't have the time to really investigate, however, we know that it was at least as large as a large grown man, walked on two feet, had weired looking long arms, and didn't show it's face to us. It was uniformly black and couldn't have had clothes on to look like it did.  It seemed surprised to see our lights round the bend but did not seem worried or in a hurry to get out of sight (though it did in about 3 seconds).  We rode around the loop we were on and came back to the point where we had the sighting and nothing had changed.  No deer, nothing.  We discussed this for several days and decided it had to have been a bear, but we all know that it couldn't have been.  Considering the latest events within 10 miles of here we decided we should post this.",,Haralson County,Georgia,Winter,Report 18377: Possible sighting by multiple witnesses on farm near Buchannan,33.81461,-85.15337,12/18/2006,18377,Class B,dn52q7c0qs,70.89,54.795,38.7,43.56,0.8,0.02,0.93,0,0,,1025.69,Foggy overnight.,3,8.46,340,0.02
"In Sept.2006 my 18 year old son and a friend were camping out off of hwy 255 in Habersham Co. (next to the National Forrest and right beside WhiteCo.) They were frightened and run off by howls and growls they swore were not human. High pitched Ape like sounds then VERY LOW long growls. The horses were huddled in a ""defensive"" stance then at the high pitched sound would run as if they were stampeeding. The boys said they could hear something walking near them but when ever they looked out nothing was there. The next week I went to feed alone and NONE of the 7 dogs that live there would go to the pasture with me. THIS WAS TOTALLY OUT OF CHARACTOR! I could hear something following along beside me but each time I stopped to look it was as if a flash of dark just ran by. I wasn't scared, but I KNOW something was there. January 2007 8 of us went to the barn late at night we heard the sounds the boys had heard and all people and dogs were accounted for inside the barn. While we were in there one old horse that stays in at night was in his stall and he would NOT calm down for anything, not even food! He circled in his stall yelling for 45mins. While he was doing that 2 of us were in a stall with an other horse and something hit the outside of the barn right at that stall. This happened 4 or 5 times until some of us went to look. NOTHING WAS THERE! It was very dark and my son started throwing horseshoe in the direction of the noise. He threw 5 one at a time. We heard 3 hit the ground or trees or bushes, 2 NEVER HIT ANYTHING, BUT WE HEARD GRUNTS RIGHT AFTER HE THEW THEM! Febuary 15,2007 my friend Cathy and I have been on several websites looking for clues as to what we are dealing with. We have found 3 foot prints, these are NOT ""giant size"", but they are much larger than human. There are 2 different Areas that look as if something large has been bedding down there. There are trees that look like the markings of territory shown on some of the web sites. One of the most increddible things we have found is an area by a little stream where an oak tree was down, still fresh, and some of the bark had been shreded and appeared to have been chewed. The gorund around it was totally dry, but the ""chewed"" bark was slimmy wet, like spit. I brought some home and put it in a baggie and today it is STILL moist! It looks as if spit bubbles are in it. After picking this up and heading back out of the woods we knew something was following us. We heard the high pitched howls, sticks beating together and trees and bushes moving. Still we could not see anything. HOwever I told her to take 3 stepps together and stop with out talking, we did BUT WHAT EVER WAS FOLLOWING US DID NOT!! Then we REALLY got some vocals. We don't wish this any harm, but we do want to know what is there. We are planning to stay out in the woods near this site This up coming weekend.

"About two years ago I was riding my bicycle with a friend of mine out in a rural area. Just out side of Calhoun, and just barely over the county line in to Walker County. I heard what sounded like heavy wood knocks. Big loud ones. At the time I just thought maybe someone was building something off in the woods. But now I’m more inclined to believe that it could have been a Sasquatch. Because there was nothing but woods, and fields in the section of the road where I heard the noises come from.

"While riding 4wheelers my wife and I and another couple decided to follow the railroad tracks to the next town. It was about a ten mile treck that goes through swamp and none of which is developed. I have never followed it before at night. At about halfway to the other town (Meldrim,Ga.) it looked as though the light at the far end of the tracks was getting brighter.We pulled off the side and backed up to the ditch that parallels the railroad bed to wait to see if the light got brighter.While waiting my wife and friends sat and talked and I climbed back onto the tracks on foot to watch the light. The plan was to wait ten minutes and if it didn't get brighter it was possibly a light from another source. After about five minutes my wife and her friend heard something moving progressively closer in the woods. Then large objects began falling around us. I looked at everyone asked had they heard it , then there was no doubt. Larger objects started coming down -large rocks ,large limbs. Many were landing in the water, not all in the same place , not all the same size, making huge splashes like bricks would make or larger. One then two,then multiple large things landing on both sides and on top of the tracks. Everyone with me by then was right beside me and none of them were playing a joke. Something was throwing stuff at us from the woods. I kept shining my flashlight but never saw what. These were big objects and there is no way any animal I am familliar with could have done this. I have hunted all my life and stay in the woods all the time but this truly freaked me out.

"I am mainly submitting this report to see if any one else has recently submitted a report in this location for the same date. On Thursday April 1st at around 9:00 a.m. myself wife and two sons were on our way to Hilton Head for spring break, We were also following my Parents. As we were coming down the hill on Hwy 16 East (about a mile from the Swainsboro exit) which is a four lane highway two lanes on each side seperated by a large median, most of the area in this part of middle GA is swamp or marsh. Fairly heavy traffic was around us too, which I should explain as about 3 cars right around us with about a hundred yard break and then at least 5 to 6 more. The group of cars is where this happened. The group of cars in front of us were approaching a wooded area in the median (which widens even furter at that point, and on either side of the highway was dense woods) at this point something came out of the woods on the right side of the road and sprinted across the road almost right in front of a semi. What was so strange was that this thing seem to clear 2 lanes in 2 steps. At his point I was trying to rationalize why a man would do this and not wait for a break in traffic. I watched leap in to the woods. At this point I looked at my wife and and without a word she looked back and said did you see that. I immediatley called my parents in front of us and my mom answered the phone and her first words did you see that and what was it. All i can tell you is it moved at lightening speed my wife said she saw it go across the other 2 lanes.

"I was 19 years old at the time. My family and myself dont ever talk about what happened. It happened one evening in the woods in mid November of 2003. My grandfather owns about 4,000 acres in Coweta County. The land consists of a small cabin, some barns, 3 lakes, and lots of off road trails winding and criss crossing everywhere throughout the woods. My father, grandfather, uncle, and 1 cousin hunt the land as much as possible during the hunting season. We had our own 4 wheelers and would depart to our separate tree stands or specific areas to hunt each day. We have all hunted this land for a very long time, since i was 10 years old. Never before have any of us seen, heard ,or even thought about bigfoots being in these woods,ever! My father and I had just purchased a set of 2 way motorola radios to communicate between each other while hunting. well this particular spot i was going to hunt that evening was very deep in the woods in the north east corner of the property. My father and i had scouted this area the day before and we had noticed some strange things. Along the edge of the power line, for about a 20 foot stretch, there were tree limbs, about as round as my wrist, and a good 15-20 foot from the ground, broken and snapped off. There was this rock about thirty feet into the woods from the power line. This huge rock had been recently overturned but the thing was about 4 or 5 feet wide by 3 feet tall. This part of the woods had main power lines running through it which are very favorable to hunt deer on. I had decided that night that if a bear was in this area, I wanted to hunt it. I went there in the morning to set up my stand and scouted the area a little better. We met back at the cabin at 10:00a.m.. My grandfather said that he has never once seen a bear or bear signs of any kind in the 20 plus years hes been hunting in coweta county. He said it sounded ridiculous and that i shouldnt go hunt there by myself, but the thought of being able to bag a bear in these woods was too much! The time came to depart to the evening hunt. My dad told me to keep in touch with the 2 way radios if anything happened and that he would be located about half a mile or more from me. I rode my 4 wheeler down the familiar trails and parked it a couple hundred yards from my newly found hunting destination. As I approached my stand i had put there that morning i noticed a nasty smell in the air, not strong but would catch wiffs of it with the breeze. it smelled like old garbage. I was sitting in the tree stand for a good hour with no action, but the whole time that smell was barely present. My stand was about 40 feet into the woods from the power line near the overturned rock. the power line itself was streched along my left side with the thick woods to my front right and rear. I had a natural path through the woods to the power line, a perfect opening to see anything crossing. i was quietly looking around waiting for a bear to appear when all of a sudden i heard the familiar sound of a deer approaching fast from behind. i looked over my left shoulder to see a doe running through the woods at full pace from the powerline, running fast like something had spooked it. Out of the corner of my eye i saw a flash of movement through the woods along the edge of the power line, just where the doe was running from . i lifted my gun and peered through the scope to try and catch a glimpse of the figure that was making its way along the edge of the powerline. I was hoping it would be my bear and was waiting for it to cross that opening through the woods to the powerline for a clean, clear shot but when the creature/figure stepped into that opening, I saw through the scope that it wasnt a bear but looked human. Just 1 simple stride from this giant thing and it was out of sight of the opening. i was so stunned that i couldnt fire off a shot; besides i thought it was a man. But the thing was very tall, possiblly 8 feet. It had a cinnamon- dark brown hairy looking body. The shoulders were broad and squared and its long arms swung from side to side as it walked at a very fast pace. It happened so fast, i could only get a good look at it for a split second, letting me see enough to know that it wasnt a hunter. After it ran across the opening to the power line i heard a big commotion, starting at the powerline about where that thing should have been and heading into the woods right towards me! I tried to grab the motorola radio to get help from my father but was shaking so bad that i fumbled with it. I quickly lifted my rifle to get ready to blast whatever this big mysterious creature was. 3 more doe came bounding up looking spooked as hell which was the commotion i heard coming my way from the powerline.  The 3 doe ran as fast as they could and outta sight behind my right shoulder. Nothing followed them, nor did i see or hear it again, but that nasty smell still lingered in the air. I called my father on the radio and told him to get over to my spot to get me . I told him I wasnt getting out of the tree stand until he gets there. He came quickly to retrieve me and found me very disturbed. I told him everything that had happened and he didnt know if he believed me or not, but knew i had seen something.",n/a,Coweta County,Georgia,Fall,Report 15457: Daylight sighting by hunter along powerline route near Newnan,33.48295,-84.7681,8/29/2006,15457,Class A,djgwrp3u24,90.09,81.31,72.53,72.75,0.77,0.23,0.18,0.0001,0.17,rain,1011.82,Humid throughout the day and partly cloudy in the afternoon.,7,8.75,242,0.9
"About a year ago, I was coming home from taking my grandmother to work.  We lived on a paved but heavily wooded road. There are numerous ponds and fields surrounding the area.  As came across the final curve in the road, something caught my eye.  Just on the inside of the ditch by the pond before my house stood a figure.  At first glance I would have thought my eyes to be playing tricks. I slowed down and stopped fearing that I was going to hit a large animal.  I seen this tall figure (roughly 6 feet to 7 feet in height)turn and stare at my headlights.  It was Auburn-Brown and had very wirey hair.  Its head was kinda of oblong like that of monkey.  The face was flat other than the wierd looking nose (looked like a squished pig nose).  Its eyes glowed red in the headlights.  Once I stopped, it immediately turned and crouched into the ditch below.  I was so scared of being attacked that I drove the half mile home, ran inside and told my parents all about it.","Exact location details withheld per request of the witness, but the sighting took place about six miles east of Moultrie, GA, off of GA Hwy. 37.",Colquitt County,Georgia,Summer,Report 27300: Late-night roadside sighting by a young man outside of Moultrie,31.18562,-83.66153,8/15/2009,27300,Class A,djs92jpt3h,86.37,80.685,75,72.54,0.86,0.55,0.82,0.0148,1,rain,,"Heavy rain starting in the afternoon, continuing until evening.",7,10,86,3.46
"On October 7, 2009 at about 11:30 pm , my wife and I were returning to Weeki Wachee , Florida from a trip to North Carolina .  We were driving south on US 441 in an unpopulated area at about 65mph. We were about halfway between Homerville and Fargo  which is slightly west of the Okefenokee Swamp . It was very dark with very scant traffic and we were the only car in sight. There were no other lights visible anywhere and no houses or businesses anywhere around.  My wife had turned on the map light because we were getting low on gas and we needed to check the distance to the nearest probable area for gas. She was looking down at the map and didn't see it,  but she  sure smelled it.  Years before , we had been camping in the Okefenokee Swamp and were aware of the wildlife diversity. I have hunting , camping , and Brazilian jungle experience and I am not easily frightened, but this shook me up.   It was an instinctive reaction similar to when you have a surprise encounter with a poisonous snake. I saw a very dark brown/black constant colored tall humanoid figure standing on the left shoulder of the road , quarter facing toward the road and toward the direction of our travel. The figure was standing still,  very vertically erect with both arms loosely down at its sides. I couldn't see any facial features or individual features of hands or feet. I estimate it to be about 7 ft. tall and weigh between 200 and 300 pounds. It was lanky rather than stocky and was not crouching forward , but was standing very vertical. The smell coming into the car vent was very powerfull and was a combination of sewerlike and a strong musky animal odor. There was a small animal roadkill a few yards down the highway that was fresh , so that wouldn't account for the fowl odor. We conjectured that the creature had smelled the roadkill and came out of the woods to investigate. The hair on the head was long and stringy, but the rest of the body hair seemed only two or three inches long and layed down rather than sticking out in a fuzzy fashion. The thing that struck me was that I couldn't see any facial features or varied colors around the hand areas. We thought about turning around to re- investigate,  but in the middle of the night , I frankly didn't think it was prudent.  We proceeded to the next major intersection to buy gas, and I asked the station employees if anyone else had mentioned something unusual or if there were any kind of unusual wildlife sightings in the area. They answered ""no"".  That was the end of our incident. All but one of the sketches I have ever seen of creatures anything like this , showed a more stocky crouching ape-like creature. What I saw was a tall, lanky , humanoid  creature that looked almost ""helmeted"" because of the way the head hair fell straight down similar to a woman with long straight hair. I could see no neck . I don't know what I saw but I will never stop my car at night anywhere that area.",,Clinch County,Georgia,Fall,Report 26822: Late-night sighting by motorist couple between Homerville and Edith,30.83105,-82.6386,10/7/2009,26822,Class A,djmprs87vh,91.94,83.955,75.97,75.88,0.86,,0.61,0,0,,,Humid throughout the day.,0,,252,2.3
MY brother and I were fishing on wolf creek in a area known as high shoals. This area is heavily wooded with steep terrain and a rushing waterfall. We had park our truck at the top of the hill and walk down the trail to the creek below. We had been fishing about a hour and had no luck when we decided to move upstream. We got our gear together and starting walking up the shoals and heard a large splash hit the water up ahead. We first thought it was a rock that had rolled of the side of the steep terrain when suddenly a large black/brown human like creature was slashing at the water with it's long arms. The creature never new we were there and we must have viewed him for 2-3 mins playing around in the water. We never moved only making eye contact with each other. Suddenly it darted off to the right up the steep terrain not knowing whether it had seen us or not. We never got a good look at it's face. It must have been 6-7ft. around 300-400lbs. and look very healthly. We were around 25-30yds from it. We kept this to ourselves for quite a while only shareing it with family members . We have returned to the area several times and have never seen it again but have seen unexplained markings when no bear is to be in the area.,The area is steep terrain in some places clear cut in some and very wooded in others.

"I am about to graduate with a BS in Biology, and want that noted. The incidents began in the fall of 2004. It started out as hearing strange howling sounds in the evening. I never heard the vocalizations in the day time.  In the fall of 2004 some friends and I went camping on my driveway. It was the middle of October, and around 2 in the morning I heard a loud grunting sound and trees snapping. The noises were so loud that they woke me up. It was a full moon that night and clear, and when I opened the window on the tent I could not believe what I was seeing. I saw a large dark figure with eyes that seemed to illuminate red in the moonlight. It was beating something in the head which I found to be a deer come sun up. The creature drug the deer up to the top of the hill above the camp sight. It walked up on top of some big rocks and I could make it out perfectly. 8 to 10 feet tall and covered in hair. The one friend who stayed the evening saw the exact same thing. I watched it eat the deer. It pulled off appendages like it was nothing. Shortly after it started eating it noticed our tent. It walked right down to the side of the tent, and the smell coming off of it was intensely musky. It knocked the frying pan out of the tree by the tent as it was walking by, and when it hit the ground, it ran back to the top of the hill. The deer carcass was gone, but hair and intestines were left behind. The liver, spleen, heart and lungs must have been eaten. We followed the drag marks from the carcass and found a mass of pine trees bent and broken into some form of shelter. I have many other encounters that I can share. They are real and they are here. I have had rocks thrown at me, and I have been charged by one twice. I barely got inside the house both times. They do not like light, and they do not like it if you shine a light directly at them. I say them because on more than one occasion my fiancé and I heard at least three. Hardwoods and swamps surround my house. When this started there were many subdivisions going in, and massive habitat loss which had to drive them to my property. There is also a 20,000 acre national forest that is squatchy as all get out about 7 miles from my home. The sounds are not as frequent now, but they can still be heard from time to time here. I only hear them in fall and winter though. I am also a hunter, and when I was hearing the Squatches every night, there was not a deer to be found. When I did see deer they were very jumpy. This was during archery season that I made this observation, therefore no gun shots were occurring to spook them. I promise you from the bottom of my heart that they are real. I have seen them in person more than once. If the wind is right you know when they are close because of the smell.",Halls Bridge road runs parallel to Jackson Lake.

My ususal routine is to walk my two dogs early in the morning off my property on an improved road and back to the house.

"I was in South Georgia at a Hunting Camp I had just joined that year.  I was leaving the camp site and driving throught the planted pines (maintained dirt roads) to go to my stand.  Directly behind camp is approx 30 - 50 acres that no one is allowed to hunt for safety purposes.  There is also a small pond in this area.

To my surprsie, a black ""animal"" came out of the woods on all fours, angled 45 degrees away from me.  I tried to convince myself I was seeing a bear, or possibly a cow that got loose.  However, as I watched from 50 feet I noticed the complete absence of a tail.  I watched the animal in the open road, in broad day light for 10 seconds.  It came directly out of the woods, and ran down the road then crossed into the opposing woods and disappeared.  I could see that the rear legs appeared longer than the front, and the head was closer to the ground.  Also, as it ran on all fours the animal loped, with the slope of the back changing rather than remaining level.  As if the front was bouncing.  Further, the legs and rear were much too thin to be that of a bear.  Though I did not see the ""face"" - from the limited sight of the head, there were no clearly visible ears.

"Last December in Brooks County Georgia in the early hours of the morning I was driving home to Florida on Clyattville Road.

It appeared as I drew closer to be reaching for something beyond the bridge, (perhaps leaves of the trees) I began to slow down as I approached the bridge, fearing this very big man was drunk, and would stagger in front of my car.

"I live in Des Moines, Iowa, but almost every weekend I take my wife and daughter down to the country just outside of Earlham to visit with my parents. The incident happened during the later weeks of November. Maybe the 17th or the 22nd? It hadn't quite started snowing yet, but it was getting colder. We were driving back from my parent's house on Hogback bridge road at about 11:30 PM or so and I will admit to being fairly drowsy at the time, but I have driven that road countless times, tired or not, and have never encountered something like this. My wife and daughter had already fallen asleep by the time we reached the intersection. On the left side of the road I thought I saw something crouched in front of the intersection sign. As we neared the sign, whatever it was stood up and acted like it was going to try to cross the road. My heart skipped several beats at the sheer size of this thing. It was easily 7-8 feet tall, was very skinny/lanky, and was covered with shaggy, matted brown hair. It's eyes reflected yellow in my headlights like a cat's. I recall saying ""Oh God."" as I swerved a bit in terror but kept driving. After I had passed it and the realization set in of what I just saw I turned and woke my wife up and told her. She acted as concerned as someone who was just woken up could be, but wasn't able to fall asleep again until we got home. I was so scared that I called my mother who lives only a couple of miles away and told her to lock her doors. She agreed to do it, but didn't believe that I had seen anything, of course. I've been researching the possibility of sasquatches ever since then and came across this site. One thing that was odd, is that several of the other Iowan sitings were in November as well. Perhaps this could indicate a migratory behavior?","The sighting occurred on Hogback Bridge Rd. Coming south on 169 out of De Soto, you'd want to take a right on G14 and a left on Hogback Bridge.

"Around 7am, let's say the first week of November of 2007, I was making a phone call to try and get some help on a very large roof I was working on. Standing to the right of the house, facing the back, is a large open grassy field surrounded by woods. I was looking to the back staring at this particular tree that stood out to me, when suddenly something very tall, very large, stepped away from the tree looking at me. My arm with the phone dropped and my jaw dropped and I was thinking to myself, ""What the **** is that!"". It's fur was brown to reddish brown and it covered the entire body that I could see from the waist up. Just as quickly as I had seen it, it made its way across the field in a matter of seconds.  I was on the phone but I took note of where I was standing and what was around me. Next to me were a couple of snowmobiles and about 5 feet in front of me was a red quad and I was on the far right corner of concrete pad. The grass was very high because the day before I had noticed a couple of deer walking through the field and all I could see was their back, neck and heads. The next day my brother-in-law came out and we walked back where I saw this thing. When I looked back towards the house I couldn't see the red quad or the snowmobiles at all. I saw no clear footprints out there. There were lots of trails through the grass that could have been made by anything. When this thing ran across the field it was slightly leaning forward. It had to have been at least 7 or 8 feet tall in order for me to see its entire upper body over the grass. The next day when I showed up I couldn't get in the house because the alarm had been triggered. I called the home owner and he said that something triggered the basement door alarm and a basement window alarm that night. He had to leave in a hurry and forgot to reset the alarm. I thought that was very interesting, but I did not tell him what I had seen the morning before.","South of the city of Dubuque in Northeast Iowa, very near the Mississippi River.",Dubuque County,Iowa,Fall,"Report 25071: Daylight sighting by a roofing contractor near the Mississippi River, south of Dubuque",42.4104,-90.66615,11/7/2007,25071,Class A,9zx92bdfmx,40.83,35.05,29.27,22.35,0.68,0.28,0.93,0,0,,1023.89,Mostly cloudy starting in the evening.,2,9.66,192,3.39
"On Aug 31st I was on my way home from work in Richardsville, Iowa.

I was just about 10 to 15 min north of Sageville, IA on 52 north when to be coming around one of the curves of this winding road when I saw a dark figure in a forward lunging position running at the same time leap over the guard cable and as i was passing that very spot I could clearly see its dark shorter hair and its shoulder and upper arm as if being lifted to clear the thick bushes. I pulled over and turned around at the next driveway and stopped and ran back to that point of entry but by that time it was gone! no noise so it may have found cover quickly and I couldn't see it. it appeared to approx 6ft tall and well built upper body and very thick muscular legs. its head was long and cone shaped.

"I took my son Myles fishing behind Sundown Mountain ski resort. We turned west off of Asbury road on to Twin Springs Drive, where there is access to the stream. I had been promising my son some night fishing. We sat on a couple of buckets facing south, to the rock out cropping and wooded area across the creek. We were fishing in the deeper water across the creek near the rocks. We heard sticks breaking and rustling which I assumed were coons, as this is a good coon area. Then we noticed something larger coming toward the other side of the creek from a distance. Thinking that this is one of many deer that we often see, thought nothing of it until we caught sight of it in the back-light of the city or moon from the other side of the hill we were facing. This was a large bipedal animal, very unlikely to be a person, this time of night without a light (although we were fishing without a light source also). It came up to the top of the rock out cropping direct across from us and stood between two trees. It then squatted down and just sat there watching us. My son was scared, and I was intrigued. Within 10 minutes another came to join the first to his right and stayed just across a ravine. No more than 6 minutes later another came from the south, just to the left of the one squatting across from us. As this one got close, it let out a piercing shriek. Nothing like the calls that are heard on the TV shows. This was high pitched and frightening. The other two took notice and began to move toward the shrieking Squatch. At this point we had had enough and grabbed our fishing gear and ran back to the truck.

"It was in the fall of 2006, we were camping.In the Volga River Rec. Area in Fayette, IA. It was myself and 5 other friends. We were sitting around the campfire, I'm going to have to say it was about 11:30 P.M. There was a campsite farther down from us with a husband and a wife. They also were sitting by the fire. My friends and i decided to take a walk about the campsite. There is a open field along the road of the campsite Josh and I decided to sit there to see if we could call in some coyotes that night because the moon was full that night making it easy to see. The rest of the guys went back to the campsite. Josh and I went and sat along the side of the field. We were sitting there, making the sound of a dying rabbit. The field is border with large trees, and bushes. After about 10-15 minutes, we see a large ""person"" step out onto a little hill at the edge of the trees off to our left. We had a tall friend with us so started saying to the person, "" haha Mike very funny!"" gestures of that sort and the person didnt move or speak. All we could see was its upper torso and its eyes color, I can't recall the exact color. So we ran back to the campsite to make sure it wasnt just our friends spooking us, and sure enough they were all there. Josh and I grabed a shotgun that I had brung for safety, and when we got back to the spot the ""person"" was gone. We were both very frightened by this we ran back to the campsite told everyone what we heard no one believed us. Later that night I saw it again, this time it was in the woods across from our campsite, just on the edge of the woods. The moonlight was bright. This time I called everyone over to look, this time Mike, Josh and me all saw a very large black shadow across the road moving towards the first spot we had seen it. After the incident I really had no idea what this was. It was very large man like probably about 6- 6.5 ft tall all i could tell is it had a black color to it. I also saw eyes that is all I can recall from the incident, hearts were definetly racing at the time.

"I like to go to Gotch Park and watch the Eagles. I used to stand in the middle of the bridge for a cigarette before I went home from work. I had done this a few days in a row. That day I got out of my truck and felt like I shouldn't be there. As I walked to the middle of the bridge I felt VERY Uneasy. I lit my cigarette and starred out over the river. I felt like I was being watched and I started to get scared. It was coming from the other side of the bridge on the right hand side.

"Incounter happened on 7th of November 2006. I voted in the Idaho election at 8:00 a.m. Then I went straight home and loaded my two horses to go elk hunting for 3 days in the Big Hole Mountains east of where I live, approimately 25-30 miles away. I had camp all set up by noon, wo I decided to go for a horse ride and maybe hunt a little before dark. The creek drainage I planned to hunt was Big Burns Creek. I rode up this drainage as far as Bear Trap, the third canyon coming into this drainage from the west. I tied the horses up at the mouth of this canyon and decided to hunt for a few hours before it got dark on the ridge on the north side of Bear Trap and south of Temple Peak. I arrived back at the horses just as it was getting dark. I took my backpack off and tied it in the saddle of the horse I had ridden in on, so I wouldn't have to pack it going out. I slung my rifle over my shoulder and got on my second horse. I had ridden approximately 1/2 mile when the encounter took place. Riding south, with Big Burns Creek running parallel along my left side and making its normal loud babbling sounds cascading down over the many rocks, just as I was entering the confluence of where Little Burns Creek came down from the east at my left and entered into Big Burns Creek. I heard this very loud, voluminous, high pitched, slightly raspy scream. This scream completely over powered the noise coming from the creek. It screamed again again. Each scream lasted 3-4 seconds. The screams didn't noticebaly change in pitch or tone from beginning to end. It was just an intense scream like a large animal that had just been startled. My horse that had been following behind me, came trotting up to my right side about 3 yards away just beneath a tree. Both horses just stood there like a couple of statues, frozen in place. The air thermals were going down the two canyons, so these animals and my horses couldn't smell one another. My scent was drifting down and to the right because of the air coming from Little Burns Canyon, and their scent was being carried down and to the left because of the air coming down Big Burns Canyon. The animal doing the screaming was slightly to my left at approximately 40 yards standing right in the middle of Big Burns Creek. All that I was thinking was maybe I had just ridden into a Mountain Lion. A few years before a friend at work told me of a Whitetail Doe that screamed at him one afternoon on the river bottoms. I just couldn't put an animal with the scream. I think it was right after the second scream that I heard the sounds of the second animal. It was 40 to 50 yards east of the one doing the screaming. I heard a loud whistle followed by some 4-5 fast verbalizing grunts {agh ooh egh egh} The whistle it seemed to me was like a man would make if he laid his lower lip over his teeth and whistled to try and get somebody's attention clear across a canyon. This loud whistle and grunts also overpowered the sounds coming from both creeks. It seemed to me the second was communicating with the one doing the screaming. And I just couldn't put any animal with those sounds. I've hunted elk with the bow for many years and I think I've heard just about every sound an elk can possibly make. The whistle and grunts were not coming from an elk. Elk don't scream like the scream I was hearing. Big cats don't whistle and grunt like the sound I heard from the second one. By then I was wide awake and fully alert. I didn't have a light on my person. I had two lights in the left side pocket of my pack tied on the other horse. After much effort I was able to get the horse I was riding to break away from the trance he was in and move to my right up next to the other horse. I reached over and removed an energizer headlamp, and the Mini Mag flashlight which held two AA batteries. I fumbled around and got the headlamp put on and got both lights turned on. Looking down in the middle of the creek where the screaming was coming from there were the eyes of a predator {eyes coming out of the front of the head}. They seemed large because they were reflecting so much light back at me. They were reflecting exactly the same color that I was broadcasting out from my lights. The energizer headlamp was on the white diode mode and the mini mag flashlight had a slight yellow color to it. The eyes were reflecting mostly bright white with a slight tinge of gold. Having the lights turned on it didn't stop it from screaming. It continued to scream another 3-4 times while the lights were on it, for a total of 6-7 Loud screams. All the same volume, length, and intensity, etc. Although I was very concerned, I really wasn't teribbly afraid. My heart wasn't pounding with adrenilin and I didn't feel I was in a life threating situation, because the one doing the screaming stayed put and wasn't getting any closer and being aggressive. I felt more like I was the one scaring this animal. I must have blinked my eyes at just the right time, because all of a sudden the eyes disappeared and I didn't see which direction it went. I sat there looking and listening for about 2 more minutes. Hearing and seeing nothing more I thought whatever it was had probably left the area. I kicked my horse to go on down the trail. He didn't want to move. I gently talked to him telling him its OK, and kept kicking and encouraging him. I think he could still see something out there in the dark that I couldn't see. He finally started down the trail. I still had my lights on and kept looking at the edge of the creek nearest me, which was about 10-15 yards away. I expected something to jump out of the creek toward me any second. When I had traveled down the trail about the 40 yards or so I looked up on the other side of the creek. There standing side-by-side at approximately 25-30 yards were two sets of eyes. My guess is that the one doing the whistle and grunts came down the 40-50 yards to help the frightenned screaming one. When it arrived the screaming stopped and it got out on the bank with its buddy. The eyes seemed to be about level with my eyes as I sat on the horse. But my two lights didn't have enough candle power to see the outline of bodies with the eyes. I also couldn't see how high or low the bank was which they were standing on or any of the brush and trees which I knew was on the other side of the creek. One of the sets of eyes was higher up than the other. I sat there on the horse staring at the two sets of eyes for about 1 full minute. Then the one on my right slowly turned to it's left and verified to me that it was the eyes of a predator. Its left eye slowly narrowed to its right eye and disappeared almost at the same time as the right eye. Then the one on my left turned and followed behind the first. I sat on the horse for a couple more minutes looking for any glint of eyes as they moved away from me but I never saw them again. It's now the 4th of May 2007. When it first happed I had no idea what had happened to me. When I returned home and called by son to tell him about it. He flat out told me I had an encounter with a couple of sasquatches. He has been reading on the BFRO site for quite a few years. I being a slow learner was quite skeptical. I talked to every Mountain Lion hunter I could think of, to pick their brains as to what sounds they would make. Including Fish and Game personnel. This just left me as frustrated as before I talked to them. So before I thought I was going completely crazy, I gave Jeff Meldrum of Pocatello a call. I felt like what I'd heard and seen was not a great surprise to him for he had heard similar stories many times. After the first of this year 2007, my son told me of two sightings in Idaho on the web site. One in Northern Idaho and the second in the same time frame as mine within a few days and only 20-25 miles south of my encounter and east of Idaho Falls. My son then let me read Jeff Meldrum's book that he received for Christmas entitled ""Sasquatch: Legend Meets Science"" and I learned more about what evidence they have for the existence of these animals, including one thing that might have made my horses act the stupified way they did. When I talked to Dr. Meldrum I told him I was going to return first thing in the spring to the site to check for carrion to confirm Mountain Lions or not. My son and I took a horses to ride back up there on the 29th of April, nearly 5 months later than the incident and before the high water runoff could wash away any evidence. I took 3 pictures, one from where my horses and I first heard the screaming, etc. and two pictures from where I watched them across the creek. I had my six foot son stand in two different clearing places they could have been standing on the far bank. The one on the north side of a tree with thick brush and one on the south side of the tree. My sons head was level with mine while I was on the trail sitting atop my horse when standing on the north side of the tree. And the south side where I found a breakaway portion of the overhanging bank and the only possible footprint just next to it on the south side of the breakaway, where I thought the animal climbed up on the bank out of the creek. My sons head was about a foot lower than mine while I sat on the horse. If the south of the tree was where they were standing side-by-side, that would make them in the 7-8 foot height range. The heel portion of the right foot was quite visible but when I first noticed it I was facing the creek on top of the overhanging bank. I looked to the side of the breakaway and noticed the back heel portion of the print about 4 1/2 to 5 inches in front of my right boot. I wear a 10 1/2 to 11 glove size and this heal print was about the size of my fist. The depth of the heel print was about 1 inch deep with the rest of the print coming straight back up along the side my boot. When I realized what I had just done my heart jumped right up in my throat. As I lifted by foot out of the track it looked as if my boot heel was just about where the toe prints might have been if I hadn't stepped on it. I measured by boot length when I got home and it was 11 1/2 inches Long. Which would have make the track 16-17 inches long. I've heard the expression of putting one's foot in his mouth but I really felt awful when I realized I'd just screwed up the only possible track that we found by putting my foot in it. And that, as they say, is about the size of it. At first I thought I was loosing my mind cause I couldn't place those sounds with any animal I'd ever heard. But now, after learning all I could about these animals for the last 5 months,  I'm better than 95% sure I've been one of the lucky humans to have had an enoucter with these elusive creatures. And I wouldn't have traded this experience for the Biggest Bull Elk in Idaho.","To get to the location of the encounter, you would drive east of Ririe turning North to cross the river West of Heise Hot Springs.

"I was lying in my tent on the last night of our camping trip.  I remember thinking about a story my brother told me about an incident several years earlier where he and my other brother encountered a bear in this same area.  I was on the verge of drifing off to sleep when suddenly an overwhelming sense of dread and fear overcame me.  I was immediately wide awake, but was afraid to make any noise so I remained still.  I heard footsteps very near my tent.  I could feel the presence of something very large.  It moved slowly and I could hear what sounded like deep throated breathing.  When I heard whatever it was move closer to my tent, I sat up as quietly so I could put my glasses on and grabbed my .44 magnum revolver.  I wasn't even thinking about sasquatch at the time.  I was afraid a bear had possibly wandered into camp.  I finally got the courage to turn on my flashlight and everything outside went silent.  I heard no more sounds, and never smelled anything unusual.  Then as suddenly as it started, my intense feeling of anxiety was totally gone.  I did not hear anything running away, but I felt safe and was able to relax enough to go back to sleep.

"While out deer huntning myself and my wife found a set of tracks alongside Forest service road 2302. This road starts on Forest service road 406 and travels for approximately 1.5 miles before dead-ending on a hilltop. The tracks were approximately .75 miles up the road just past a clearing. These tracks were about 16"" long and 7"" wide. The toe prints were clearly visable. It had rained earlier that morning and had light showers intermittently throughout the morning. The tracks had no water puddling in them and appeared to be fairly fresh. I have been a avid hunter for many years and can distinguish between fresh and old tracks.

"I used to regularly camp in the Whitetail Campground in Farragut State Park near Athol, Idaho. It is especially peaceful during the offseason and I used to like to camp there on weekends from about early May to mid-June. During these times it is dead quiet at night and I heard wood knocks several times (sound really carries due to the large lake surrounded by mountains and hills). At the time I thought it was interesting, but made no connection to Sasquatch. After reading reports on this site I now think the sounds are more interesting. Late one night my wife and I were asleep in our large family tent in Whitetail Campground. It was dead quiet in the campground and we both woke to the sound of a large animal walking through the brush, loudly breaking branches as it stepped on them. We both thought it sounded like it was bipedal and I thought it was a very large man. I wondered why someone would be wandering around in the woods in the middle of the night. The footsteps got closer and closer and then the animal was in our site. It brushed against the tent as it walked past. It headed over to a patch of large mushrooms that were growing at the edge of our site. We looked out the tent window and shined a flashlight around but we couldn’t see anything. It was quiet then, and we assumed that whatever it was had kept going. We turned out the light and got back in bed. A few minutes later the animal walked back out of the campground the same way it came in – it just stood quietly when we were shining the flashlight. When we got up in the morning all of the mushrooms were gone. I thought a lot about what the animal was. I don’t think it was a bear, unless it was a very large one (there are no grizzlies in that area), and I thought that the stride length was much longer than a bear’s. I also think a bear would have reacted to the flashlight, let alone the noise we were making moving around in the tent. I thought it could be a moose, but I have watched them walk before and I don’t think the sound would be bipedal. I have also heard that moose are not nocturnal. I don’t think it was a large person; it was very dark and the animal obviously had no man made light.",,Kootenai County,Idaho,Spring,Report 63726: Camper reports knocks and camp intrusion at Whitetail Campground in Farragut State Park near Athol,47.96905,-116.5499,5/15/2008,63726,Class B,c2t0gu6zyr,77.82,61.37,44.92,43.94,0.59,0.08,0.38,0,0,,,Clear throughout the day.,9,9.44,145,2.68
My 14 year old daughter and her friend were quadding in the woods behind our property which are owned by timber companies. They stopped by the waterfalls to look around and came upon a large footprint on the timber trail. It had rained a couple of days prior to this. There are lots of cedar groves and pine in the area and lots of fresh water from streams and waterfalls. They took some pictures with their phones and with my daughter's friends foot next to it. They told me about it when they got home and showed me the picture. My daughter took me up there and we saw more prints coming down the hillside to the trail and crossing it into the cedars. The trail is not very wide so this is the only print on flat land. I tried to get a plaster cast but did not have enough plaster and it rained before I was able to get more plaster and the imprint was washed away.,About 10 miles south of Coeur d'Alene and 5 miles west of Hwy 95.,Kootenai County,Idaho,Summer,Report 30868: Tracks found during a nature ride near Mica Peak.,47.61947,-116.9945,6/15/2010,30868,Class B,c2kycsz5w8,57.49,48.28,39.07,40.29,0.75,0.2,0.14,0,0,,1013,Clear throughout the day.,7,8.704,234,5.39
"OCt 27 2005 Hello - quick note from me, a geologist (40), and unfortunately only 2nd party to two witnesses that had an extended sighting in July of this year (lasting ~20 min.) -- quite similar to other sightings I've read on your excellent site. (Note from Investigator:  the witnesses provided a detailed written account. It is included in its entirety in the Investigator Commentary section below.) The bottom line: Latah County Idaho, ID July (I think), this year. Ponderosa fields. From a promontory, large dark colored, sitting, sometimes turning Sasquatch was observed. It had a lighter colored smaller one with it and it was later deduced that the large one was intermittently nursing the younger one. Then they were seen moving, both across a field, and along a road. After they left – the witnesses went to the place and observed crushed dry grass, very large stride traces of foot prints in the dry terrain and were surprise by the remarkable scale of vegetation versus the clear views of these bipeds. The male observer – in his 40s - is a pilot with 20/10 vision, experience as a backcountry bow hunter, and in fact as a young man at a hunting camp (somewhere UT?) was told by one of the elders that the weird howls in the middle of the night were in fact Sasquatch. However, he was very surprised/ intrigued by this long visual encounter.

"In February of 2011 I was traveling down Highway 95 between Potlatch, Idaho, and Tensed, Idaho between 12:00 a.m. and 2:00 a.m. It was wooded pasture off to the right side of the highway and open grass pasture and creek on the left (drivers side) of the highway. I was driving into a curve before Wiegand Private Road when approximately 40-50 ft in front of me I saw a very large, dark form walk straight across the highway, right to left. I assumed it was a human so I slowed to full stop in the middle of the highway, which was empty both directions except for me. It was at this point that I realized that I could not see this person off the side of the highway or out in the grass pasture to my left. I had my high beams on and the area was very well lit from that. I developed an awful sense of dread and immediately hit the gas and headed for home, which was about 5-6 miles away. I was so bothered by this event that I continually checked my rear view mirror, fully expecting to see something horrible or have something horrible happen to me. Once I got home I bolted into the house, turned all the lights on, and woke my family up. They kind of laughed it off but my dog crawled up into my lap and whined/cried at me and wouldn't leave my side. I definitely didn't sleep that night and started avoiding driving that highway so late at night. It wasn't until later that I really started to process the details of what happened. I realized that I saw someone, very distinctly bipedal, walk across the highway. I remember the walking motion of the legs and the slight swinging motion of the arms. I also realized that while I had my high beams on the figure was completely black. No reflection from clothes, shoes, or even a shadow thrown onto the highway. The other thing that very much bothered me was that I never took my eyes off of what happened but somewhere between the figure walking across the highway and walking off the side, it disappeared. I definitely should have been able to see something walking down the side of the ditch or into the pasture, but it was completely empty. It took me quite some time to come to terms with what happened and even longer before I admitted to myself that it may have been a Sasquatch related sighting. I've recently been compelled to report this specific sighting due to the fact that recently a woman claimed to have seen a Sasquatch right before hitting a deer in almost the exact same area and a similar time frame but she's been made into a joke in the local news. I don't know if she actually saw Sasquatch, but I find it a very, very odd coincidence that it happened in that area of the highway and in the same time frame.",The last curve in the highway before Wiegand Private Road.,Latah County,Idaho,Winter,Report 57248: Late night road crossing sighting near Potlatch on Hwy 95 spooks woman,46.97822,-116.923,2/15/2011,57248,Class A,c2kg7257bw,37.31,34.28,31.25,33.28,0.93,0.99,0.42,0.0241,1,rain,1005.6,Snow (2–4 in.) throughout the day.,2,1.218,184,1.75
"In August of 2006 my (ex)wife and I were camping in the mountains of North Idaho.  We drove my 4x4 pickup to the ridgeline that divides the St Joe river and North Fork Clearwater river. This is accessible by USFS and BLM roads, the latter of which is generally only open June to September due to the high elevation and snow. The weather at this time was favorable and we chose to sleep in the back of the truck rather than using the tent. We both felt very uneasy after laying in bed for at least an hour. This uneasiness is difficult to describe but we both felt very strange and decided to start the truck and go back down the mountain. The night was clear under a full moon. We were easily able to see the trail without headlights and drove slowly downhill. After only 5 or 10 minutes of travel we rounded a bend in the trail and saw something large ahead of us. I flipped on the headlights and a very large creature seemed to jump off the trail and into the woods moving downhill and to our left. We caught only the briefest glimpse but the creature was easily 8 to 10 feet tall and covered in brown fur. As the creature jumped from the trail it seemed to catch a fir tree which obscured it from our direct line of sight. The tree was about 12 to 14 feet tall and bent tip to ground before springing back up. This all occurred in a matter of seconds. We both said ""what the f**k was that?!"" I hit the ebrake and got out of the cab with my maglight and my 30/30 rifle. Shining the light through the trees illuminated at least 50 yards clearly as the alpine forest is not very dense except for the huckleberry bushes knee to waist high. I saw nothing and heard nothing.  I couldn't figure how any animal so large could get out of sight so quickly with no sound. No twigs snapping beyond the flashlight or anything. That's when all the hair on my arms and neck stood straight on end. I realized that the creature was laying down in the huckleberry bushes right in front of me. I can't explain as it wasn't visible but I simply knew it was right there. I had the distinct impression that this thing was waiting for me to make the next move. My wife was still in the truck begging me to get back in and leave. She was terrified. Somehow my rifle seemed suddenly impotent. My fear overpowered my curiosity and I got back in the truck and we got away from that area. I have been around moose and bears many times in the woods over the years and never felt frightened but this night I was frightened for sure. The hair on my arms and neck stands on end now writing this nearly 12 years later. I do not believe that creature was a moose or a bear. I can't help thinking that if we hadn't left our camping spot due to our intense feelings of uneasiness and had instead fallen asleep there that the creature we saw would have come upon us within a short time.","Freezeout saddle, Grandmother mountain area",Shoshone County,Idaho,Summer,Report 59472: Husband and wife see large upright figure leap from road around midnight on Freezeout Saddle near Clarkia,47.02242,-116.0518,8/7/2006,59472,Class A,c2m7x0jtmn,84.45,71.92,59.39,40.52,0.35,,0.43,0,0,,,Clear throughout the day.,0,,19,0.39
"During a camping trip along the north fork of the Coeur d'Alene river. We had recently finished dinner. While sitting fire side our dogs, a border collie and a pug leapt up and ran into the forest that separated the campsite from the creek. Neither made any sound but simply ran into the woods at twilight. Frustrated at the thought of chasing dogs in the woods at night I retrieved my flashlight from the cab of my truck. Upon approaching the tree line the dogs exploded out of the woods and ran to the truck where they cowered in fear staring into the woods. My initial fear was we were dealing with a cougar or bear. I retrieved my pistol from the console and instructed my girlfriend to put more wood on the fire. We managed to get the dogs out of the canopied bed where they had taken shelter and placed them into a spare tent. I approached the forest and while scanning the trees with my flashlight I caught sight of a large black Sasquatch standing behind a tree approx. 30 feet in front of me. I retreated back away from the woods and after a few minutes sat in my chair with my flashlight and pistol in my lap. Initial hope was that it would simply go away. My girlfriend was sitting about four feet away and after shouting into the forest that I was armed and would shoot if threatened. Then a large rock 8 inches long and 5 inches wide (I have the rock) came tumbling out of the trees and went between us grazing the top of the fire as it passed causing hot coals and sparks to fly against my dining canopy. We both jumped up out of surprise and while trying to keep an eye on the forest I was able to extinguish the hot coals burning the grass and canopy with an open soda. Out of fear and disgust I fired two rounds from the revolver into the air at a 45 degree angle. The creature then moved of to our left crunching undergrowth as it moved then stopped and we heard a large crack like that of a tree snapping and then the creature moved off to the right were it crossed the creek at the point where i had originally seen it. It made two loud splashes in the water and moved to the opposite shore where it was heard to be moving noisily up the hillside opposite our camp. We hastily gathered our more expensive gear and tossed it into the truck, leaving our tents, coolers and various items. We put the dogs in the cab, extinguished the fire and abandoned the camp. We drove 45 minutes home to Coeur d'Alene and returned the following morning to retrieve the remainder of our equipment. I found the large stone and kept it. We also discovered the tree snap was actually a twin pine about 5 inches in diameter that was broken about six feet up from the ground. No prints were seen as the ground was packed hard due to heavy use that summer. The creek was also running high.","[Investigator (MM) Note regarding location: The camp site described in this report is beside the North Fork of the Coeur d'Alene River, roughly half way between Bumblebee Meadows campground and the town of Linfor.

"JUNE 28TH, 2006.   I HAVE EARLIER REPORTED A BIGFOOT SIGHTING SEVERAL YRS AGO. THIS HAPPENED TO BE IN IOWA, DECATUR CO. AND SO HAS THIS OCCURENCE. IF YOU HAVE EVER BEEN AT LEAST A PART TIME SPORTSMAN AND FOUND YOURSELF LOVING THE NATURE AROUND YOU, THEN YOU MAY KNOW WHAT I AM SPEAKING OF.

EVEN THE NUTHATCH AND THE POPPING MOREL MUSHROOM MAKE A SOUND IF YOU ARE IN THEIR WORLD LONG ENOUGH TO HEAR THEM IN REPETITION.

"We went camping in a remote spot off of Highway 21, 18 miles east of Lowman. Turn left onto Old highway 21 and take a right on a dirt road in front of an old ranger house. The road curves around a couple of miles and we camped in front of a dirt airstrip (warm springs airstrip). We were only there for a few minutes and began setting up camp when we heard these loud high and low pitch screams coming from the woods. I asked my husband if he heard that. We listened for a moment. I screamed back at them.  I am not sure why I did that. My first thought was that there were people playing down by the river. But then as we listened I noticed the sounds were screams...that seemed to go back in forth from one direction and then something returned from the other direction. It was long with high and low pitches. This happened, off and on, for 30 min. or so. We soon forgot about about the sounds and began camping out. The next day, my sons ( ages 13 and 9 ) asked me if they could go up a tall hill and come back down. I could watch them through binoculars and they would talk to me with walkie-talkies. Not sure why I allowed  this.  Anyway, they began their walk and at the bottom of the hill they reported seeing a dead deer. They said it looked like the back leg was missing and saw another bone a few feet from it. There was meat on it and fur but they didn't notice any guts. They kept walking up the hill. After reaching the top they told me there was a valley on the other side and they wanted to walk just for a minute more. After about 2 minutes they began telling me there was an awful smell that they described as being the grossest smell they had ever smelled. They said it was like something was dead, but worse. They said they were scared and ran over the top of the hill and came back toward me fast. They later told me there were woods off to the left that they entered into. They didn't see or hear anything.  I am not sure if this is at all related to Bigfoot activities. I decided to write because a few months back I saw a show that had a man  that was recounting his Bigfoot sighting in Ca. outside of some caves and they played a taped recording of what they presume is Bigfoot. I got a lump in my throat. That was what I heard. I played a type recording off of another site for my boys who are now 15 and 11. Without any coaching, I asked them if they had ever heard that noise before. The older one replied, ""Yes, when we went camping at the hot springs. What is it?""

"I decided to turn my sighting into BFRO. I will start by saying I was introduced to the BFRO by my brother. I read some of the sightings, listened to their sounds and what they thought it might be. I took it with a grain of salt. Then in 2002 while I was visiting my daughter who at the time lived in Georgia, we both heard what we thought was one. It was late and we had decided to set around a fire. It started with the dogs in the distance barking then more and more dogs joined in until we had to raise our voice to be heard. Then came this call that was so loud and the only way to describe it was a dinosaur movie because of the volume. It did it twice. we heard 4 gunshots then silence. A few minutes later we heard sirens headed in that direction. The call is close to what is called the siren call on BFRO. There were 4 gunshots. So, I don't know. I do know what I heard was so amazingly loud. Now fast forward a few years. One of my sons was visiting and had taken his 2 labs to the forest preserve on the edge of town for a run. When he came back he told me about a deer leg he saw. He said it looked like it had been ripped off the deer and not cut. It was fresh. He thought it was odd. I did too. Still I didn't go out to investigate. Fast forward a few more years. My same daughter who lived in Georgia had moved back up here and we had decided to go to the preserves for a walk. On the trail there was what looked like a footprint, bare footprint. It was about the size of a man’s size 12 shoe. At that time I wasn't into measuring anything. I did snap a picture. The following spring me and my same daughter went for a walk again in the same forest preserve and left the main trail and took a side trail to the creek to see if we could cross it. Before we reached the creek, birds started going crazy. When we got there we heard things hitting the ground on the other side of the creek and the birds were still going crazy. What I'm going to say doesn't make sense, at least to me it doesn't. Intense fear overcame me from out of nowhere. I had to fight the fear to keep from running. I didn't understand it. The creek was too high to cross so my daughter said let's go back. When we started walking away the fear went as fast as it had come. To this day I don't know if I caused it myself because of the noise from the birds and the things hitting the ground. I do know I didn't have that same type fear when I did see one. October 2009 Goodenow Grove Nature Preserve Fast forward a few more years. I and my family had gone to another forest preserve, [ Goodenow Grove Nature Preserve ], about 10 miles south of us. My son-in-law was leaving for boot camp, so we had a going away party for him and it was one of my grandchildren's birthday. They had trails, which I wanted to walk. I couldn't get anyone to go with me so I went by myself. It was fall and chilly, so there was only 1 other group out there, which was 4 people. I went down the main trail for a ways then turned off onto a side trail. It made a loop. About half way around the loop, I stopped and was looking down a small ravine. I heard what sounded like a twig snap. I stayed and was expecting a deer to come out from behind one of the bushes. Instead I heard a grunt. I'm standing there not believing what I had just heard, when I heard another grunt but louder. It sounded just like a gorilla. I turned and walked out of the loop and onto the main trail. I wasn't really frightened at the time, just a little nervous. I walked a short distance, I notice a path through the tall grasses. It was way too big for deer. I had gotten to know deer paths. These tall grasses were in front of the area I had come out of. They were about 4 and one half feet tall. I'm 5 foot. Well curiosity got me and I had to see where the path led. Sometimes I am too curious for my own good. I got to the end of the tall grasses and could see there was still a worn path but it was leading around a large bush. Now I am deciding if I want to go closer to see if the trail leads back into the trees. In order to do that it would put me closer to the trees. I took a few steps forward and still couldn't tell. I looked at my watch to see what time it was and if I had time. I had been out there for quite awhile. I then looked up to my left were the trail was going and back down to my watch. I was trying to talk myself into going closer and around that bush. I then looked up again and that is when I saw it. It was running just inside the tree line. It was brown, slender, about 6 feet tall the hair was about 2 inches long. It was a little stooped over while it was running and actually grabbed a small tree as though to propel itself. This was fall and a lot of leaves were off the trees. This and the fact that it was only about 40 feet away is why I could see it clearly. It made no sound when it ran and I can tell you it runs as fast as any other animal. It had Amazing speed. I stood there for a few seconds stunned then fear gripped me because the realization that it was running in the direction I was looking to go. I felt like I was being cut off at the pass. At that instant I turned and walked back through those tall grasses trying to look over them and telling myself don't run, don't run, if you don't want to be chased, it's okay it's not going to hurt you. Over and over I kept telling myself these things. I got to the main trail and walked out looking into the forest all the time. When I made it out, everyone was gone except my husband who was sitting there waiting for me. My heart sank. I wanted someone to go back with me. Even though it was scary, it was exciting too. My husband at that time could not walk much and I couldn't put him through that. I can tell you I was so upset that everyone was gone and of course nobody believed me.","Take 394 to Goodenow Road, if heading south take a left on Goodenow Road.

"On Friday, July 28th- my 15 year old son was visiting his grandparents on the Lake of Egypt in Marion, Illinois. After dark he remembered that he didn't take the battery off the charger on the bass boat so he headed down the hill toward the dock. Since it was very dark, he brought along his 10 million candlepower spot light. He went down to the lake and started taking the charger off the battery. He decided to shine his light on the other side of the cove to look for raccoons or turtles or coyotes or deer, whatever he might be able to see. He looked to a point off the cove and noticed a big black figure or ""glob"" in the 6 or 7 foot tall grass. He realized it was not something that he had seen during his visit while fishing (for 2 weeks prior). He flashed his flashlight on and off to get it's attention so it would look at him. He wanted to see what kind of eyes it had. He whistled to get it's attention - and put the light back on and heard a different whistle back. My son looked up top of the hill toward the house to see if his grandparents were playing a trick on him and no one was there. So he instantly flashed back to the spot where the creature was standing. He saw it starting to move away and he noticed the tops of the weeds moving as it left.

"I had set up hunting camp on Sept 29 in preparation for the up-coming deer season which did not start until Oct 10.  On the night of Oct 7 something woke me up and I sat up in bed just in time for the travel trailer to start shaking rather violently.  I sounded an air horn that was sitting on the table and this had no effect at all.  I then grabbed my truck keys and pressed the panic button setting off the horn and the lights flashing, this stopped what ever was shaking the trailer.

Sixty plus years old at the time with years and years experience in the mountains and this truly scared me.

"I was playing with my dogs about 200 feet from the campfire right before sunset. I heard a weird sound behind me, pretty far up the mountain. I thought that I just imagined it and kept playing with the dogs. After about 10 minutes I heard it again,  along with a second call farther up the canyon. I thought that I imagined it. Another 5 or 10 minutes went by and I knew the third time that I had heard it. I was a very loud, sharp call very much like what a primate sounds like (from what I have seen on t.v.). I was instantly on edge, as I have camped/hiked in this area many times over about 10-12 years, without any previous incidence of these sounds. I went back to my campfire to start dinner when I heard it again-this time my dogs took notice and were very uneasy as well. After 2-3 more instances, with my 3 dogs cowering at my feet, I decided to respond. Immediately there was a call in reply that sounded agitated,  They proceeded to call back and forth, progressively getting closer to my location, and it was getting dark. I got in the back of my SUV with my dogs to try to relax and think, and then I heard sounds very close in the trees not far from me. The dogs went from terrified to attack mode, barking and jumping at the back & side windows, and I realized the sun roof was open. I panicked, jumped over the seat and started the vehicle and jetted out of there.All of this happened in about an hour or so.","A very popular southern Idaho creek valley, just on the Utah border.",Bear Lake County,Idaho,Summer,Report 28386: Camper and his three dogs hear possible vocalizations and cut camping trip short in Beaver Creek,42.35635,-111.5212,6/21/2003,28386,Class B,9x88yq8xxe,58,47.775,37.55,37.04,0.72,,0.75,0,0,,,Mostly cloudy until afternoon.,7,,265,3.5
"June 2009 above Crouch, Idaho.  It was mid afternoon, and my husband and I were riding our ATV and dirt bike.  Dave was about 200 yards ahead of me, and we didnt have sight of each other.  We were on the main forest road that leads up the mountain, past the turn off to Silver Plunge.  The road gets a bit windy up there, and so we didn't see each other. I was coming up to a curve in the road where to my left is the embankment down to the river about 40 feet, and a cliff to my right.  The only flat part was the road.  It happened so fast.  I came around a bend and saw a huge dark figure on two legs, upright bounding right up the mountain side to my right. The sound of the branches snapping were louder than my motor.  I kept driving about another 100 yards, around another bend trying to catch up to Dave, who was sitting on a quiet bike with his helmet in his hand wearing a puzzled look. "" Did you see that?"", I yelled struggling to get my helmet off. He said,"" yeah...it was huge, hairy and fast!"". We drove back to see where we both saw it separately, and there was evidence of something climbing up the steep mountain.

"I live in Kimberly Idaho. While my grandson was here visiting we drove to the South Hills in the Sawtooth Forrest.  We turned off on a dirt road called Wolstrom Hollow. I have been there many times looking at the beaver dams. We drove as far as we could then parked my pickup and walked for about 1/4 mile more, when I saw, through the trees, a silver object and thought I heard people talking, which would have placed them where the beaver dam is.  I stopped and noticed a lot of elk and deer droppings and a very strong smell. I asked Brandon if he smelled it and he said no. He said he kept hearing loud sticks banging together or against rocks.  I could not hear that, but I kept smelling a very strong odor.  Then Brandon said he saw a scary thing, at about the same time my dog, which was on a leash, barked very loud with her hackles up.  I said lets get out of here. On the way back to the pickup Brandon says he thinks it is following us, and my dog keep looking back.  I just said keep walking, I didn't want to look like prey. At that time I didn't know exactly what he saw. We got in the pickup and drove out. Brandon then told me he saw a large hairy thing, hunched over, very tall, bigger than a bear and had peircing yellow eyes.  He kept telling me it looked him right in the eyes and scared him so bad he couldn't move or talk. Please let me hear from you.  I had to tell someone.  Then I talked to a friend who hunts and ride horses in the mountains and has cattle up in that area.  Well he said that someone reported a bigfoot sighting around there about 3 years ago, and they saw the tracks.   I am too afraid to go back there by myself.

"In the summer of 1997 I worked on a buffalo ranch near the town of Dubois, Idaho.  The ranch itself sits about 30 miles outside of Dubois near the Continental Divide.  I am an avid fisherman and after working long days on the ranch I would spend many evenings fly-fishing along Medicine-Lodge Creek. One night as I was fishing, a rainstorm quickly moved in over the divide ( as is common in the summer months).  I decided to start walking back to the ranch, to avoid getting soaked. I had been fishing on the opposite side of the river from the ranch and therefore had to cross back through the river to return home.  I walked the banks of the river for a few minutes in order to find an ideal crossing spot.  I finally found a break in the willows and started wading across the river.  By this time it had started to rain and a cold, dreary feeling had set in over the river.  As I was wading across the river I saw a slight movement above me in the river.  I turned my head and froze immediately.  At first I thought I wall looking at a moose or even a bear which are both common to the area. The creature was probably 200 ft above me in the river. I was scared to death, and could not move.  Then the unthinkable happened.  The creature, which had previously been hunched over slightly, stood up on two legs and looked directly at me.  It was then that it occured to me that I was looking at the infamous sasquatch.  One of the things I remember that was striking was how human-like the creature's face was.  It was much darker obviously, but very much human.  It had broad shoulders, although so do I, I am 6'6"" and 300 lbs. (I have recounted this story to many people who have joked that I saw my reflection in the river).  I remember thinking that the sasquatch was not as hairy as I would have thought and that it was not as tall as I had ever imagined.  After what seemed an eternity, the sasquatch, started to walk into the willows.  As soon as I saw movement I began to run across the river (as fast as I could in waders and in water).  When I got to the bank I took a glance behind me to make sure the sasquatch hadn't circled around to come after me, after seeing that it hadn't I took my waders off and sprinted back to the ranch.  I will never forget this experience. I have had many friends try and discount it and talk me out of what I saw--I will never change my story.",Take 1-15 North aprox. 60 miles from Idaho Falls to Dubois.

"In July of 2007, a friend and I went camping and fishing to the Birch creek area off of Hwy 28 in Clark County. We crossed the creek and set up camp at the trail head in Eight Mile Canyon. There is an ATV trail system that loops up the canyon and around the mountain range. One evening we decided to go up the canyon to the southwest and explore a bit before dark. We found a lightly used trail that went into a dark canyon. We suspected it went to a dead end but we went up the trail to look around. The trail went through a dark canyon that seemed to have thicker vegetation then the main Eight Mile Canyon. I remember noticing that there was a lot of dead fall. We got to the end of the canyon trail that was about two miles in and came to a very scenic view of towering shell rock cliffs and bowls. We realized that it was slowly starting to get darker so we decided to head back to camp. As we rode down the trail I stayed about 50 yards behind my friend. It was getting dark enough that the head lights on our ATV’s were illuminating the trail and passing trees but still enough light in the sky so you could look around and see hill sides and clearings. Being a hunter I was looking for big game as I traveled. At one spot the trail started to angle to the right. As my friend made the curve I remembering observing what I though was a weird stump or log off the trail to the left. It seemed about four feet tall and I thought I don’t remember seeing it there on our way in a couple hours ago. Just after he went by it stood up. This thing was facing away from me and looking toward my friend as he drove away. I was too close to do anything other than stay my course and go by. As I started going by I leaned away from it to my right. It looked over toward me over its right shoulder. It then appeared to straighten out its right arm toward me. I ducked my head and accelerated up the trail. I don’t feel that it was trying to harm me even though I was extremely frightened at the time. I estimated the being to be about 8 feet tall judging from the height judging from my height on the ATV at the time in relation to its arm height. It had no clothing. It was covered in dark hair from the top of its head down. I noticed it had dark skin on its face and yellowish eyes. The right hand was similar to a humans with fingers and a thumb, all dark in color. I remember smelling an odor similar to an elk in the rut but with a stronger scent. Two years later several of us decided to go back to the canyon and ride the main trail system. As we went by the old trail head we noticed that the forest service had boarded off the trail with an elaborate wall of fencing stating trail was closed to traffic.

"This is a two part report of what may be easily explained,or not.  My first odd experience was in Kickapoo State Park, in Vermilion County Illinois,in Oct.2005. I was fishing at a pond in the park, when I heard two BIG splashes in the river about 50 to 75 yards behind me. My first thought was a deer bounded across the river, then I heard the most awful scream I've ever heard. Almost immediately after the scream, I could hear what sounded like a scuffle in the dry leaves. After the rustling in the leaves stopped, I could hear what sounded like a large cat breathing hard or ""purring"". I don't know how else to explain it. [We don't have large cats in our area.] The purring sound lasted maybe a minute, then I could hear this creature moving away. I'm an old Boy Scout, and have spent alot of time camping in this area, and I know most of the sounds in the night woods. This sound flat out scared me. It bothered me enough that I went home. I got home and my wife asked me why I was home so early. I told her the story, and thought that was the end of the story. Untill.... the following spring, fishing along my favorite stretch of the same river, I run across a tree that had been snapped over (I can take you to it). That may very well be explained by spring flood waters, but I find it odd, the direction it is snapped. In early summer (late May,early June) I was driving through the park, and smelled a terrible musky stench.There are alot of deer in this area, but you almost have to be standing next to them to smell them.   I don't think we have enough wooded habitat to harbor these kinds of animals, but it is a large enough area for them to use as a ""highway"". I have not observed any footprints on the soft sandbars.

"I live in Freeport, Illinois in a trailer pk. I was out bow hunting in my timber I own. I got up in my tree stand about 6:50 a.m. while it was still dark, hoping a deer would come in right at light.

I could hear it walking away. About 7:10 to 7:15 am it was foggy, not real bad, a light fog, real thin. It was about 50 degrees out and fairly light by now.

"Note: the witness names have been changed for privacy. My name is Jim, and I've reported a vocalization experience which happened approximately 11 years ago in the same area. Regarding this following report, I'm submitting it on behalf of my nephew, who is the primary witness and who experienced the sighting. I've discussed this experience with him, and questioned him at length about his sighting.  I can confidently endorse this young man, knowing him to be intelligent and level headed, with no previous history of exaggeration or embellishment. He is 14 years old, a high school freshman, and has lived in this area since his birth.  However young, he has a substantial amount of hunting and wilderness experience, and he's familiar with the indeginous wildlife of the area.  He contacted me by phone on the evening of the 18th to discuss his deer kill, along with his unusual sighting of the morning.  I've followed up with him in person today, November 19, 2005, to reconfirm his account prior to posting the report to your organization.  His account follows; ""My name is [Jason].  In the early morning hours of the 18th of November, prior to dawn, I prepped my hunting gear and left my house. My deerstand is approximately 600 yards behind my parent's home.  Directly behind our house is a large open field, with an estimated 250 yards east to west, and 500 yards north to south.  The perimeter around this area is medium growth forest [e.g. Oak, Silver Maple, Elm, Sassafras]. I was walking back to my stand on the far edge of this field, along the edge of the forested tree line.  I had parked my ATV at the treeline and began to walk the rest of the way back, and was carrying a flashlight and 20 gauge Remmington Express shotgun. As I approached a turn in the treeline, I immediately saw something walking toward me, at a distance of about 45-50 feet.  I could only make out a dark silhouettte.  At first, I thought it was my uncle who was also hunting in the area behind my house, but quickly realized that it was NOT my uncle, for several reasons; 1) it had no orange hunting vest, 2) it was extremely large, and 3) as soon as I saw the creature, it evidently saw me and it turned quickly, then ran into the tree line (towards my treestand).  Again, it was extremely large. Unfortunately, it was too dark to visualize any specific features, but the silhouette seemed to be approximately 7-8 feet tall. It was definately walking on two legs, and it was entirely too fast to be my uncle. (My uncle is a coal-miner who has an ankle injury and cannot jog or run at this time.)  I didn't have any time to shine my flashlight on it, or pull up my shotgun to take aim. The entire sighting lasted approximately 10-15 seconds, possibly shorter.  I didn't notice any smell before or after the sighting, and didn't hear any sounds. The creature moved with unusual quiteness and stealth.  I also heard no foot-falls as it ran, but I realize that I may have been too shocked to notice sounds.  I then moved to my deerstand where I got up into the stand as fast as possible, then called my mother to let her know that I had made it to the stand and told her about the sighting.","8 miles south/southeast of Harrisburg, Illinois, 2 miles south of a small burg called Mitchellville, at the edge of the Shawnee National Forest.",Saline County,Illinois,Fall,Report 13070: Youth has pre-dawn encounter on the way to deer stand near Mitchellville,37.63,-88.55,11/18/2005,13070,Class B,dn9n0frfek,50.76,42.85,34.94,23.39,0.59,0.11,0.59,0,0,,,Mostly cloudy in the morning.,3,10,197,3.73
"I am writing this report on behalf of my girlfriend.  Although we were both together on this camping trip, I unfortunately was alseep and did not hear a thing.  I have questioned her extensively and replayed the Ohio Howls for her, which she says is a very close match. We had decided to take the kids camping at Williams Hill Pass OHV park.  It is a rather large campground, over 200 acres with only 15 or so camp sites.  It is primarily for ATV trail riding.  We stayed over Memorial Day weekend, arriving Saturday afternoon.  The weekend was uneventful.  All the other campers left by Monday afternoon and we had the entire park to ourselves.  When I awoke Tuesday morning around 7am, my girlfriend says I heard something weird this morning.  She said it sounded like one of your Bigfoot recordings.  She went on to say that she had gotten up around 4.30am, unable to sleep (it was rather hot and humid all weekend).  While stoking the fire she heard a howl off in the distance which imediately invoked the barking of several dogs off in the distance.  She described the sound as being distant yet loud as if amplified, to use her word.  It continued for about 3-4 mins.

"We happened to notice a large complete footprint under an apple tree in our backyard measuring about 18"".  We live at the edge of a subdivision that backs up to a deeply wooded stream that eventually leads to a large man-made lake. Our lot is rather extensive and towards to back we have several varieties of fruit trees including apples, peaches, nectarines, cherries, and pears. The foot print was found under the most mature and biggest of apple trees with a level muddy area under it amongst a sloping yard that leads to the stream. Coincidentally, the area on the apple tree directly above the print was devoid of apples while the remainder of the tree was more abundant with fruit.  We've also noticed in years past that we see fruit growing on all of our trees but by the time it's near maturity it all disappears. We just figured it was raccoons but apparently not. Our next-door neighbor has a cuddly german-shephard who roams leash-free around his yard but rarely comes into our yard unless accompanied by our neighbor. After we showed the neighbor the footprint, he told us that his dog darted out in the backyard one night then immediately came running back and cowered near his owner for the remainder of the night. Ever since he is leery to roam the yard and has even been sleeping in his owners bed, which he never did before. Our neighbor also reported hearing high-pitched catlike shrieking noises in the last few weeks. After the discovery of the footprint we discovered a decapitated rabbit.  The head was completely torn clean away from the body as if it had been ""popped"" off.  It wasn't shredded or otherwise bloody, just simply guillotined.

"I was just outside and my 3 yearold lab was spooked by somethig like I've never seen. Barking--in a fear sound-- and running in circles! Wind is in the west and that is the direction of her concern. Only other time I've seen this was 2 years ago when she was spooked smelling the air. I could smell it too. It was like the worst locker room smell mixed with road kill. It took her 3-4 days to settle down. Tom The witness first contacted the BFRO with this report on June 23, 2011. On July 19, 2011, I met with him at his house. I interviewed the witness that day and had him explain what types of things he had been experiencing. Since then, this location has been the site of an on-going investigation with a long-term audio recorder left in the woods near his house. I interviewed the witness again in late October 2011, and the content of the two interviews follows: The first name of the witness has been changed. Stan - When was the first time something happened that you didn’t understand. Tom – It was a year ago, so it was probably early June of 2010. It was a Saturday, a friend had stopped by. When I am outside my dog Lulu roams the property, sometimes she will go back into the tree-line but she usually stays close to me. At one o’clock in the afternoon we were in the shop talking and doing stuff. When he was getting ready to leave I called for her. She was real nervous, her tail was tucked. There was a light breeze from the south and she was facing towards the south and acting very unusual. Tom - I figured it was a deer, a coyote, something back there. I walked back a little ways and she wouldn’t move, she just stayed here by the side door, very nervous. I finally said, let’s go in. My friend had left. I opened the door and had to raise my voice to get her to come in, which was unusual because she always wants to stay right near me. So I raised my voice and she came in and she ran straight down the steps into the basement and hid. I first thought when she went down that she was looking for a toy or something. After ten minutes I went down and found her, she was hiding behind the furniture in an unused room, cowering, and I reached down and she wouldn’t come to me. I reached down to touch her and she was shaking. Tom - I made her come back up for awhile and then we went back outside and repeated the same thing five or six times to about  8 o’clock that night. We had Lady Asian bugs and I am apparently sinus sensitive to them and that night around 9 o’clock I got my sinuses cleared up and we stepped out that side door, still had a breeze from the south, and she instantly panicked and went into that cowering motion, still shaking and standing low, not up like a dog does. Tom - I stood there and thought about it for a little bit and got a good whiff of it. The best description I have is that it was like the worst locker room stench or sweaty clothes that sat in a hamper for two weeks mixed with maybe road kill, bloody violent. It stood the hair up on my back. I sat back and thought wow, the trees are two hundred feet away, what is back there that smells so bad. And at the time she laid down in the yard, facing the south and was real nervous. She would look over her should behind her and then she would get up and face the other way because the wind currents were changing and she kept doing that. So we went back in for the night. Tom - Next morning I got up and went to church and breakfast, came home, got dressed and walked back in there. She walked with for a ways and then she turned and ran back up here to the house. Tom – From that time on there have been few deer and coyotes around. Prior to that I could see deer most every morning out back or down the roads. I think I have only seen one deer on my property in a year. Last night was the second time I’ve heard coyotes in a year. And usually if I grilled chicken out they would be howling, they would smell it and they’d be singing. Stan – After that initial time did you smell it again last year? Tom – I never noticed it again. About a week before, my nephew called and said there are footprints in a subdivision south of Chatham. I said that bugs me because a few days ago she (Lulu) was out back behind the brown shed barking in defense and I stepped out to see what she was doing. She had her nose up, she was following the wind currents I think, because she was running in circles, tail was tucked and she was real nervous. And I called her and she looked towards me, like she was ready to come to me and then she would jump like something spooked her, an animal, like you through a rock at her.  She did that for a couple of days when we were out. It was in the west that time and she was facing west. Stan – Have you ever felt like you were being watched? Tom –  Yes, just about every time I see her doing something like that, a few times I’ve been outside, I get that feeling. Stan – Have you ever had anything thrown at you, like rocks or anything. Tom – No. Stan – What about sounds? Tom – Last night, it was probably after 10, I think it was 10:30 or so I had been watching TV and I noticed she was restless in the house. I asked her once “Do you have to go potty?” Usually she would come up to me and she would give me a “Ruff” and we would go. She wouldn’t do that last night, she just looked at me like “keep guessing”. About 10:30 I said “Come on let’s go potty and then we’ll go to bed. We stepped outside and she immediately faced south and froze and I got the feeling while she was doing that that somebody was starring at me. Tom – So I stepped back in, grabbed my cellphone and my big spotlight and she was still outside. I stepped outside and started walking south towards the treeline, but she stayed right by that door. Now normally a dog will follow its master, and I got about half way between the pool and the treeline and stopped and stood there a little bit. And I could hear (it was real quiet you could hear crickets) stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp. My hair stood up, I thought “What in the world is walking in twigs and branches?” And I said “Who’s there?” and I stopped, and I’m thinking “a couple of my friends know and are they pulling a prank?” And then I think I said it again “Who’s there?” like that. Tom – And I waited and there was a “Whoo-oo” sound like that came back at me, probably not that loud because it knew I could hear it whatever it was. Right after that, west of here, and I would say a good half mile coyotes started screaming and yelling. Now, I don’t need to be out here alone, I don’t have a gun, I don’t have a knife. My dog was spooked, she was staying up at the house. So, I came back in, started turning the light off, fifteen, twenty minutes passed. Tom – I have a little sound amplifier and headset and you can adjust the volume. I went quietly out onto the deck, left her inside, and I sat for fifteen or twenty minutes listening. I could hear some footsteps same interval steps that was west of me now back in the trees. I said “There is something back there, but I’m not going to go look after dark not when it’s something powerful. Tom – Anyway when I came in from that I went to check email and Facebook was up with the link for Chatham for the story they just published in the paper about footprints and Messing With Sasquatch. Stan – So did you hear any other vocals. Tom – After I heard the footsteps and I called out and it made the sound back I started walking back up to the house. I heard what sounded like children playing and they weren’t very far away, like a couple of little girls giggling or talking. Now there are no kids back there, I know there can’t be. The next house is a half mile down the road or so. My dog Lu, started out to me and I said “Who is that?” and she froze and came right back to the house when she heard it again. Stan – So it sounded like kids playing? Tom – Like little girls talking or playing. Stan – No crying, more as a conversation? Tom – I don’t know how I would describe it, it wasn’t understandable, it wasn’t “I want that toy.” It was a whining, high pitched voice like a little girls would be. Stan – Thank you for allowing me to interview you Tom. Tom – You are welcome Stan. On Sunday, October 23, 2011, the witness had an unusual experience at his home and the next morning found a large footprint outside his living room window. He took pictures with a tape measure along the footprint. Tom was also able to see all the toes in the loose dirt. But it's always difficult for photographs of footprints to show very much detail. My interview with Tom concerning this incident follows: Tom – I have an L-shaped couch and I am sitting on one end of it, the other end is under a window, and that window is on the east side of my house. We are watching the World Series, it was probably around 9:30 and Lulu, my dog, raised her head and then looked at me with big eyes like “Did you hear that?” And then she turns and looks at the window and I go “Yeah, I heard it.” And I said “Go ahead and get down.” So she got down, came out on the floor and laid down so she could watch the window. Tom – And we heard the noise several more times, and she got up wandered around the house and smelled floor, and walls and was just nervous. Tom – Then the next morning we went outside and there was a footprint out there. Now let me back up a little bit, Friday I pulled some rose bushes and raked the landscaping right there next to the house, so it was all fresh. So, that footprint happened I believe Sunday night. Now this scenario where she is on the couch and we hear this noise, this has happened seven or eight different times this summer. Stan – Can you describe the sound. Tom – It just sounds like a creak, like somebody is leaning against the wall on the outside. And I’ve got vertical blinds and they’re turned to block the light where I am sitting but when you are outside you can look and see the TV if you are tall. I can’t see the TV when I am outside. I am six foot tall. So for someone to look in that window has to be more than six foot tall. Right footprint found the 24th of October 2011 showing a length of 14 inches. Stan – I know you had a ruler next to the footprint, how long did you think it was? Tom – It is 14 inches long. Stan – And the width was? Tom – 7 inches wide. And the footprint is curved, it almost looks like a broken foot or something, I don’t know how to describe it, but it’s not straight like ours. Where ours has an arch this looks like the footprint is curved. Stan – Thank you for allowing me to interview you Tom. Tom – You are welcome Stan.

"[Witness first names have been changed] On Tuesday evening June 28, 2011, I along with fellow paranormal investigator James arrived at the Cumberland Sugar Creek Cemetery in rural Sangamon County near the small town of Glenarm, Illinois a little before 10:00pm. James and I are both paranormal investigators and had previously talked about trying to find the cemetery to check it out for a possible paranormal investigation. Upon finding the location, we decided to do a quick walk through of the cemetery to see if anything of a paranormal nature was occurring and to check out the cemetery's layout. We also had heard from other local paranormal sources that a group of paranormal investigators had been pelted with rocks or dirt clods thrown from the tree line around the cemetery. This occurred less than one week ago and during a paranormal investigation. We had also heard of several recent sightings of large tracks or foot prints in the Covered Bridge area of rural Sangamon County which is not far from the cemetery. James and I both felt that the throwing of stones sounded like classic Squatch activity and because of this we decided to check the tree line around the cemetery to look for possible signs of what may have been throwing the stones at the paranormal group. This is when we found the following. In the Southeast corner of the cemetery property and next to an opening in the fence line, we found a mound of fairly soft clay. As we were looking around the mound of dirt, we noticed what looked like a fairly large foot print. Upon further examining the foot print, it was apparent that whatever had been walking there was barefoot. In the same proximity we discovered two other footprints which were approximately the same size. We estimated the size of the prints to be at least fourteen inches long. The footprints were also barefoot. The tracks were headed away from the cemetery and towards the southeast. Because we had not planned on doing anything more than a walkthrough of the cemetery we did not have our usual camera and lighting equipment with us, so we took several photos of the footprints with James’ cell phone camera. We also noticed that approximately 75 feet or so and to the North of the footprints a fairly good sized tree of maybe 3 to 4 inches in circumference had been snapped and bent over. The tree was located next to but outside of the fence. The area surrounding the cemetery is rural, the cemetery itself has a fence around the rear part of the graveyard however the best that we could tell in the darkness is that it looked like there was an open field to the rear of the cemetery and it appeared that on the other side of the open field there may be more substantial tree coverage. But unfortunately due to the darkness and lack of lighting equipment, we could not determine any further details of the surrounding terrain. We then left the cemetery around 11:00pm.",Two miles west of Glenarm.,Sangamon County,Illinois,Summer,Report 32634: Two paranormal investigators find possible evidence at Cumberland Sugar Creek Cemetery,39.62,-89.6845,6/28/2011,32634,Class B,dp01rhtepx,81.53,69.87,58.21,61.56,0.71,0.04,0.91,0,0,,1016.99,Clear throughout the day.,11,9.95,336,2.12
"I was driving on Veterans Parkway in Springfield. Heading north at 60 mph. There is a heavly wooded area with a pond in the area also. It is a four lane highway with two lanes going south and two going north divided by a grassy medium. It was 2 a.m. and I was the only vehicle on the road, nothing else in sight. Then about 200 yards ahead of me I noticed something moving across the two southbound lanes. At first I thought it was a deer, since I see them frequently. So I hit my bright lights and saw it was something bigger than a deer. At my speed of 60 mph, no way it should have been gone when I reached the area where it crossed the road. It seemed to move effortlessly cross the road, in only a few strides. I was in amazement not knowing what it was. I know for a fact  it wasnt a deer. And this is not bear country, it wasn't a horse or a dog, wolf, coyote or any other animal familiar to this area. Then I wondered if it could have been the elusive BIG-FOOT. When I saw it I hit my bright lights, it had two legs and it was hunched over like it had long arms draggin right above the road. It moved so fast, not like a human or an animal and I've seen animals cross the road but this was big steps. Where I saw it, the area is very damp and has lots of deer. Its close to the water and sewer treatment. And if you know the area you know the foul smell. Good for a bigfoot. I wish I could have been more ready for it but I was like stunned.

I look for deer all the time when I drive anywhere. I was on my way home after school from LLCC. On the UIS soccer fields there was something at the edge of the field at the tree line. I glanced away and back and it was gone. It was a human shape but the shape from the head to the body was flowing with long hair all over. It was about 8 feet tall brown in color but was in the shade of the trees.

"I believe it was a saturday morning, late summer of 80-81 I don't recall the year exactly, I was 8 or 9 years old been awhile. however the incident is very vivid.... I was in the garage that morning smashing some aluminum cans. When I heard my dog barking rather franticaly. I stood up and went to the back door of the garage, and called out to quiet him down. That is when I observed him turn tail and head into his dog  house. The sound is what struck me first, I comepare it to the sound of a galloping horse...per say or at least something very heavy running paralell to where I was standing. It's like you coould fell the vibrations throught the dry ground. About 6 or 7 rows back in the cornfield I saw a rather large humanoid, roughly 7' or so I compare it to the height of the corn. Very bulky looking, It had redish brown hair and glanced at me for just a moment. It was in dead run, this whole incident lasted all of maybe 20 seconds. It was coming from the east heading roughly west, southwest.

I was in Pope county Illinois researching cougars. I arrived at camp on a Wednesday and happened to be the only camper in the area. It was near sundown when I arrived so I was cutting wood through out the night. I can recall breaking limbs around midnight when to my surprise I began hearing wood knocks coming from the near by canyon. These knocks were aggressive and LOUD. There was no wind either. The knocks returned on Thursday night and lasted until I fell asleep. The next day campers filled the site and the wood knocks stopped. By sunday the campers had left and I was alone again. I didn't hear the knocks that night but I remember waking up around 3 a.m. with a fear of something comming to my camp site.

"I believe that I had an encounter this past Fall in Massac County. I was bow hunting some public land called Sielbeck just the day after Thanksgiving when I believe I encountered a large, two legged creature just after dark on my way out of the woods. I startled the creature that was positioned just a few yards behind my parked truck. There was a large White Oak tree that had produced a large acorn drop just behind my truck and I assume it was there eating acorns. I approached my truck with my flashlight turned off and I was being very quiet due to several deer that were in the area. I layed my bow down and took my tree stand off my back and layed it in the back of my truck. My tree stand made a small noise when it contacted the bed of my truck and seems to have startled something that crashed through the woods making an lot of noise as it ran off the hill. It was definitely two legged because I remember thinking what was this person doing running away through the woods from my truck. It stopped at the bottom of the hill and screamed at me from about 80 to 100 yards. I am 45 years old and have hunted in the woods for as long as I can remember and I have never heard anything like this. The next day I was lucky enough to harvest a deer and in the excitement of doing so did not investigate the encounter. The animal crossed a small dirt road and a pasture fence at the base of the hill and screamed several more times. It appeared to move about 50 yards at a time and turn toward me and scream each time. It did this at least a dozen times as I listen in amazement. I have not reported this to anyone that compiles data regarding events such as this, only to a few friends. Of course they laughed at me but they know that I am a savvy hunter that always harvest my share of deer every year with my bow so they knew that Ii encountered something I could not explain. I consider myself a pretty good outdoorsman and I struggled for months about reporting this but I finally decided that as rare as something like this seems to be it would be a shame for me not to mention it. I know there are a lot of skeptics out there but if me reporting this put some visibility on this occurrence in this area and triggered someone to investigate and actually discover what this creature is I would be very happy. I am from Alabama and plan to hunt there again and you can bet that I will be looking for signs of something out of the ordinary. I do not always articulate myself very well so I hope that I have given some pertinent details to what occurred. Thanks and have a great day.",,Massac County,Illinois,Fall,Report 25924: Possible encounter and vocalizations heard by bowhunter near Metropolis.,37.228,-88.7476,11/26/2008,25924,Class B,dn8gu3puz4,59.66,44.45,29.24,29.93,0.69,0,0.97,0,0,,1017.47,Clear throughout the day.,3,9.96,213,0.72
"To be honest, I’m very reluctant to submit this report but the pictures and details are simply too compelling to ignore. Two months ago my wife and I purchased five acres of rural, wooded property here in Massac County, Illinois.  I mow approximately two acres of this ground, with the rest of it being heavily wooded. I know nothing about Botany, so I can’t describe the vegetation on the property outside of an Oak and/or Silver Maple trees. Just take my word for it – it’s thick with trees and underbrush. On May 3rd at 6:15p.m., my wife, myself, and my two boys sons went out to this new property to have a picnic at the cabin. I was half-way down the hill toward the cabin when my wife yelled, “Oh my gosh! Look at this - look at this!” She was up the slope close to our parked trucks, staring at the ground. I walked back up to her position and she was staring at this print on the ground (pictures attached).  I had, evidently, walked right over the track without noticing. I then searched the radial area around the track and found two more partial impressions.  Growing more suspicious caused me to search the “bottoms” behind the cabin.  I found a strange tree structure and photographed that, as well. Listen, I’ve got a BS in Management Communication and am pursuing a Masters in Theology. I am also a local minister, so my credibility is at stake. I would never consider fabricating a story, much less a story like this one. Now, we’ve got to use a little critical thinking, but this is where logic and reality seem to be in opposition.  What makes a print like the one we’ve found on our property?  There’s two plausible possibilities; (1) A very large, very heavy man or woman – with a 14+ inch foot - is walking around out in the cool spring air with no shoes, trespassing on private property, out in a rural part of the country, risking arrest or a bullet. Or (2), ? I asked a good friend of mine, and member of the church, to take photos of the print using his 10 mega-pixal camera – the photos are truly incredible.  He took several photos, including a  “foot-in” and “foot-out” to show scale, two with a tape measure, one showing depth, and photos of the area via Google earth.",(please do not post location online),Massac County,Illinois,Spring,Report 29227: Possible footprints found near Metropolis,37.2276,-88.7584,5/3/2011,29227,Class B,dn8gu3047r,64.77,50.875,36.98,41.71,0.68,0.5,0.01,0.0127,1,rain,1022.73,Light rain in the morning.,9,9.38,332,4.34
"When the sighting happened we had come down into a bottom near a stream.  The main thing we first noticed was that the entire woods had gone silent.  Before we had heard bird calls and insects throughout the woods.  The silence was really unsettling and we felt like we were being watched.  We got a little unnerved and began to walk quicker towards where we had parked the car.  As we walked the road back we could hear something about 20-30 feet behind and off to the side of us moving through the brush and undergrowth.  Then at one point we had a rather nasty smell blow through the area, similar to a skunk or fox when they musk or spray.  At one point we know it crossed the road behind us and rather quickly because the noises changed which side of the road they were coming from.  At one point we were certain it was going to walk out into the open right in front of us but then all the sound stopped for a short period of time until we went down the next hill.  When we got ready to go around the last bend to where we had parked I took a look back and saw ""something"" squatting on a point next to a dead blackened tree which stood  around three to four feet tall.  The top of it came to right around the top of the dead tree and it was fairly wide.  The only thing I could misidentify it as was a black bear and they haven't been seen in our area for well over 50-100 years.  I caught a quick glance at it and then turned back around told my friend I saw something and to just keep walking quickly straight ahead and for the car.  Once we got around the bend we ran for the car, jumped in and took off.

I was sitting at a picnic table eating pizza. I notice four kids running back and forth on a trail. Once they were gone I witnessed what I would call a juvenile sasquatch sneaking down the same trail at approx. 80 yds. The squatch was 3 and a half to 4 tall. It had long brown reddish hair. However it was stocky and I could see dark tanish colored skin threw its hair. Shortly after the kids returned on the trail. The squatch then returned behind them squatted down in the brush and disappeared.

"During the summer months of July and August my family has had a number of events that we have heard and seen what we believed to be a big foot here in Central Illinois.  We know he has left the area now.  The next year, in 2007, I saw a large off color black thing running across a field, I had my spotting lamp on it.  The thing we believed followed us home, we live a short distance from where we have seen and heard it.  There was a cornfield across the road from our house and three rows deep into the corn field there was a trail running parallel to our house and road.  Corn had been knocked down two to three rows. This ran approximately 100 to 150 yards.  My wife was home one day and heard something breathing very deep behind her while she was standing in the house.  The thing was outside the house looking into the window.  When she turned it was gone and she heard something running away.  It scared her.  The boys have went down into the area where we know he is during those months and have heard his scream and have come back scared to death.  One night we heard the scream coming from that direction.  We have asked the old timers in the area about what they know, they just don't want to talk about it.  They are very closed lip about it.

"The following interview was conducted by Stan Courtney. The first name of the witness has been changed. Stan - Can you please explain what you saw? Mark - It was just before football and I was trying to get into shape so I went for a run. The sun was still up a little bit. I went running and stopped at the road and looked in front of me and saw this big tall thing standing in the road looking right back at me, I saw the outline of it, it was too far away to tell what it was.

Mark - I didn't stick around long enough to hear anything. I don't think I told my dad about this, but the night I saw it while I was out running, I saw it looking through my front window. Stan - Of the house? Mark - Yes, and I was the only one at home, I was watching the Sci-Fi Channel. Its face was hairy but you could tell it had a human face to it. It was between a human face and an apes face I would have to say. When I looked out the window, I saw it. I didn't hear anything, I saw it once and took off and ran as fast as I ever have in my life.

"I will try to make this short. I live in Illinois in a rural area, my house is set in the woods and seeing wildlife from the kitchen window is pretty standard. Its middle winter and the visibility into the woods is much better than summer. Anyway its not uncommon to get glimpses of deer running through the woods farther back in the woods at this time of year with the better visibility , although its just that glimpses. So a few days ago in the middle of the day I witnessed some deer running at a rapid pace back in the woods I wasnt able to get a good look at them , but they were running fast , like I said the visibility wasnt great , but I saw what I thought was a larger upright looking animal chasing behind the deer. I jokingly said to my mom who was trying to see what i was watching ""its a bigfoot"" not really believing that I got a  good enough look to concur it was anything.

Well I was deer hunting with three of my friends I decided to take a break and rest near this clearing. While sitting on a log this tall thing crossed in front of me through the opening in the woods. I was about 120 yards from it and it never looked at me. It walked through the clearing very quickly and was gone. My friends and I had split up.

"Well, I went out hunting with my Lab, I got a full-blooded Lab, my dog. And as usual I went out on a Wednesday. It was a nice sunny day out, nice weather, around 72 degrees, 75 degrees, very good weather. I drove back into the area where I've been hunting every year for the last 20 years. And that's when I had an experience. The dog kept acting up. And I also noticed a kind of a stench smell and I thought maybe it was something dead. And I kept hearing something of more of like a grunt noise. So I kept hearing that and as I heard that I thought maybe somebody was playing jokes or something on me or playing a prank but then I realized there was nobody else I knew out there, there weren't any other vehicles so I went ahead and started looking around  for mushrooms. I walked maybe less than ten feet and I heard a few more grunt noises toward me and they seemed like they weren't that far off, I had that feeling that someone was watching me and as I stood there I heard it went from a grunt to, oh I would say, a loud more of a scream or yell. I have never heard nothing like that in my life before. And it proceeded twice after it did it the first time it did it again a few seconds later and then I heard three like movements in the trees, like cracking and the brush was moving and lo and behold here comes my Lab running back, with the hair all the way up from her neck and all the way down to her tail, and her tail all the way between her legs and her head down and she was looking towards the area where I had heard the noise. The dog was scared, I have never seen my dog ever act like that. That is when it kind of scared me because I thought if the dog is that scared what is it? Well then I ended up getting in the vehicle, it scared me and I still had that feeling I was being watched. I got in the vehicle and backed my truck all the way up the road that is along side a corn and soybean field I backed up and proceeded towards the back entrance where I came in and I parked it almost mile from where I was actually at when I had these experiences and I went on the opposite side of the corn field. As I went over there I thought I will hunt over here, it seems like it is more open, a lot of thickets and brush but not as thick as where I was at and it was quite away off and there was still plenty of daylight, sunshine. When I got out and walked down in there I looked across the creek and the water was probably no more than four or five inches deep. And there isn't really a lot traffic over there and when I walked I couldn't believe my eyes I seen footprints, actual footprints, and I knew it couldn't be human, a human wouldn't have walked in that area barefoot, for one there is too many thickets and he would have been crazy if he did and two it was so big Shaq couldn't have a foot that big. The first one I found was the right foot and the big toe you could see it very clear, and the other one was four feet away and it was the left foot. On it you could see the heel and the toes. Basically after that I came the next day. My son-in-law, who is an ex-police officer, wanted to go out. He was a non-believer and a skeptic and basically didn't believe me. He wanted me to prove to him I wasn't lying. So I said, ""I'll let you be the judge, maybe I'm making a mistake, maybe I didn't see what I seen."" We went out the next day and found other tracks that were in the same area from where I found the first set of tracks. So instead of finding two sets of footprints we found like six of them.

I could clearly see the entire outline of the foot, as well as 5 distinct toe prints. I did not have measuring tape but l took pictures and measured with pack of gum and a cigarette pack.

Way back in 1975 I was outside at my grandparents farm just outside Pinckneyville (Perry County) located next to a state park when I heard the most hair raising sound ever. I was so petrified that I couldn't move for a few seconds then I bolted for the shed my dad and grandfather were working in. They didn't hear it but all the horses ran up to the fence and were very agitated. The horses were stamping and blowing like when they are scared. It was very dark outside and about 10pm. It carried over from the other side of the lake so it was at least 100 yards away. There was a pig farm about a mile away but it definitely not a pig. The closest thing I have heard is similar to a peacock but sound bites of Bigfoot screams are pretty much dead on.

"It was midsummer of 1990, I was living alone in a mobile home in the woods adjoining Shawnee National Forest. I decided to go for a walk in the woods because I was bored and was thinking about shooting my rifle a bit. Nothing special, just what I normally did as a youth (since I'm not much of a people person I spent a lot of my youth in the woods). I was walking up a field road that passed thru a patch of woods that led to a larger feild on top of a hill a few hundred feet away. As I got halfway up the hill, I was suddenly shocked by a very loud whistle that was quickly followed by a scream that I had heard many times before as a kid. I knew from previous experience that I didn't want to hang around even though I was ""armed to the teeth"". I was 19 going on 20 at the time and I've spent the majority of my youth spending time alone in the woods, hunted almost everything in the area that could be legally hunted, so I know what the normal sounds of the woods are, and no, it wasn't a swine, bear , coon, or any other such creature. The scream I heard instantly filled me with fear even though I had an 8mm Hakim Mauser, 12 ga. shotgun, and a 22 cal. pistol. I always went hunting heavily armed because I have stumbled across sasquatch a few times before and decided that next time I'd be more prepared. I was about halfway up the hill when I heard the scream a few ridges over (1/2-3/4mi away from me). I quickly turned and decided to call it a night, as I was walking down the hill, I heard another scream at the top of the hill I was walking down (either they can run like hell or there were two). Before I got to the bottom of the hill, I then decided that although I had a lot of weapons and ammo, this wasn't anything that I wanted to shoot alone at night with only a maglite taped to my barrel. I figured running for the road would take too long and a more direct route would be better, so I cut across the field and jumped the creek behind my house. I guess I didn't notice till after I had crossed the creek, but it had followed me home (which wasn't far, maybe a few hundred yards). I can tell you that to keep up with a terrified 20yr old running faster than ever before, that thing had to be extremely fast. I stood by the back porch and could hear its heavy breathing and growling. It sounded kinda like a horse that had just run till it was winded, but the breathing wasn't labored. It was breathing in a normal rhythmic tone, not labored. I was terrified because even after firing a few rounds in it's direction I could still ""feel"" it's presence and hear it, so I unloaded in that direction. I fired over 100 shells thru the Hakim, a full box of shells from the 12ga. and every shell I had for my 22 before I ran in the house to grab more ammo and turn some more lights on. I must've shot around 150 or more shells, I figured that I had shot at it enough and wanted to save what ammo I had left in case it decided to try to come in for a visit durring the night, so I went in the house and stayed awake all night. The next day(about noon) I decided to go see what I hit. When I crossed the creek I could plainly see where I had fired because of the holes in the trees and the saplings that were broken from bullets. Found no blood, no footprints(it was dry) but I did find something I didnt expect...it had laid down when I began shooting and must've been there for a while because there was a flattened area that looked like a deer bed. Although deer do frequent the area, I sincerely doubt it was deer, because there was no scat, and deer scat alot in and around their beds, as well as it was a good 1/4 mi. from the nearest deer trail. I'm an experinced woodsman, and I have never run across a creature that was smart enough to lay down and stay put while bullets were flying over it's head...animals just don't have the reasoning it would take to exert that type of behavior. Like I said, I never saw it, I just heard it and heard it's foot falls, it was absolutely two legged, it was huge, and I don't think it wanted to say hello.

"Spring 2008 at grid reference  42°10'32.77""N,  88° 5'42.21""W  Near 24000 Cuba Rd, Barrington, Illinois. On the North side of the street is a township building, on the South side of the road is a heavily wooded area close to the road, with some  small residential buildings and a large field behind that. Night/predawn, overcast, slight rain. Approx: 0430 Background of witnesses: My girlfriend and I are on this stretch of road quite a lot. We frequently stop to look at animals, especially large ones like deer. We are not scared in the slightest of dealing with animals at night. I grew up in the woods, I am an EMT, trained observer, a nature enthusiast and we are comfortable in rural areas. It was a fairly overcast and rainy night , my girlfriend and I were out driving for a few hours, it was a pretty uneventful night. We saw a few deer, some raccoons and a fox. As we were driving East on Cuba road, just past Ela, at about 0430 Central time, we came over a small rise in the road and saw a large silhouette in HIGH contrast on the right shoulder of the road crossing from the left, behind the animal was reflective road sign that was bouncing the light from our headlights back at us. We did not see the front end of the animal, we could only see from about the mid chest down. The creature was up on its hind legs and seemed to be stooped over. It had very thick, heavily muscled legs. The animal seemed to be a dark gray with little or no hair, we could not tell for sure though. Within a short time, it was across the road and out of direct light, I visually tracked it into the woods on the right side of the road. The animal seemed to have gone up behind a white clapboard house and into the backyard, out of my sight. I turned to my girlfriend and asked ""Did you see that?"", she said ""Yeah..You saw it too!?!"" I asked her ""Do you want to stop and look?"" As soon as I asked that question I got a feeling of total dread that I have never felt before and immediately told her to go and not stop, we sped away as fast as we could and discussed what we saw while we were driving back to the house.",,Lake County,Illinois,Spring,Report 26039: Motorist has possible sighting near Barrington.,42.17577,-88.09506,5/13/2008,26039,Class B,dp3rgmg5sm,72.2,64.27,56.34,43.87,0.64,0.23,0.3,0.0005,0.33,rain,1014.57,Mostly cloudy starting in the evening.,10,9.97,173,5.02
I have saw what I would call a big foot three times. The first time it was in the fall of 2010. It was late at night. I woke up by my dogs barking. I got up to see what was going on. Thru the screen door I could see a large dark figure walking across my pasture going to my barn. I went back to my bed room and got a gun. I stepped out the door. The creature was a few feet from my barn and I noticed its head was level with the bottom of the roof of my barn. It was very large.  I fired one shot in the air to try to scare it off. It didn't phase it. I then opened fire. It took off running across the pasture running thru 3 strands of wire. One of my dogs took off after it and I followed. I shot 14 40 cal. bullets toward this creature and it didn't slow it down. It disappeared into the corn behind my house. I had goats in the barn.

"It was right around the time of my birthday.  I was on vacation visiting with my cousin at his girlfriend's house.  We had ran into Jerseyville for cigarettes and were on our way back to her house off of Otterville Blacktop.  I was driving about 55 mph around the s-curves just before Shiloh Hollow Road when I caught something running across the field heading for the road in the headlights. At first I thought it was a man in a trench coat.  It ran up the embankment and onto the road in front of the car.  I barely missed it.  It just made it in front of the car as I passed and half turned towards me at the center line of the road.  Within four foot from my side of the car. I realized that it wasn't a man in a trench coat.  It was covered in hair and his face look flattened with a wide nose and large nostrils, and huge eyes.  I continued to watch this thing run up a twenty foot embankment on the other side of the road without ever losing its pace.  In shock I turned to look at my cousin, his eyes were as big as mine and we found ourselves asking, ""What the hell was that""?

"To protect the confidentiality of the witness the witness names have been changed. Stan Courtney is familiar with this story since he spoke to both Mary and myself about what Mary and her husband saw. Mary lives in Algonquin, Kane County, east of the Fox River and her property backs right up against the Illinois Prairie Path, a one time railway.  This path goes from McHenry to Aurora, as far as I know.  Stan has a picture of this path that I sent to him. Mary has given me permission to write this report.  She is in pre-nursing and busy with school and hesitant to write this report herself so she asked me to write it, our mutual friend Sarah was witness to this verbal permission. What Mary and her husband saw: It was Thursday morning February 3, 2011, the blizzard had finally stopped dumping some 3 to 4 feet of snow with drifts much higher.  Mary had a snow day off from school.  She gets up and her husband immediately starts to joke with her about having to use the outhouse located in their back yard. This plastic outhouse was left over from a big party held many years before and it was never picked up by the company, so it sits there and is used sometimes during the summer.  So he was kidding her about having to use this outhouse so bad and during the worst blizzard in many, many years. She asked why was he saying that?  He said to take a look at the tracks someone left going through their back yard, starting at their patio on the side of the unattached garage, then heading south going towards the outhouse and then continuing on to the point that the tracks could not be seen anymore.  They do have a chain link fence that spans the whole width of the back yard along the path.  It seemed strange that ANYONE would be out walking in that blizzard and especially crossing their yard, very strange but they thought nothing more of it. They eventually went outside and dug themselves out of big drifts up against the house and opening up a sidewalk that leads from the back door to the unattached garage...giving the tracks no further thoughts. Now its March and Mary and Sarah and myself are having our usual Saturday morning breakfast.  I was telling them about the BFRO site and of the pictures of bigfoot tracks in the snow following deer tracks.  Well, Mary's eyes got real big and she said ""Oh my gosh, so thats what those track were"".  Of course, we encouraged her to tell us her story. A few weeks later Sarah and I went to Mary's house after breakfast and took some pictures.  By now the snow is all gone but we were able to see the outhouse and its relationship to the patio.  We did notice that the chain link fence was pushed down but that did not look like a new happening.  I asked Mary how long has that fence been that way and she did not know...just did not pay attention to it...this part of the fence was in the very south west corner of their lot, well behind the outhouse with lots of trees covering the path itself. At our breakfast as she was telling us her story we tried to think of what animal (besides a human, maybe) could make tracks like that.  There are lots of deer in the area, perhaps some coyote, but we could not think of what or who in their right mind would walk in 3 or 4 foot deep snow, not make any drag marks in the middle of a blizzard?? Mary and her husband did not take any pictures, darn, their minds were just not into thinking about a tall 7-10 foot creature walking down their driveway (which had been plowed) stopping at the edge of the patio, then walking across their yard, head towards the outhouse and then continue on and most likely leaped over the fence and onto the Prairie Path.  It was our theory that perhaps the outhouse had enough of an odor to draw the attention of a sasquatch on its way to somewhere???? I hope I have remembered things correctly...I was really hoping that Mary would do this report herself, but apparently she has some fears on telling the story accurately, I don't know.  As I said Stan has spoken to Mary at length and perhaps can add some more details.",,Kane County,Illinois,Winter,Report 29448: Possible footprints found near Algonquin,42.1551,-88.2886,2/3/2011,29448,Class B,dp3pyfn5q8,14.78,10.11,5.44,-2.45,0.67,0,0.03,0,0,,1031.26,Clear throughout the day.,3,10,235,4.07
"The day was july 2,2011 we decided to go fishing at the kankakee river out in manteno, il. Ive been fishing there for about 10 yrs. just recently about 4 yrs at the new location between the wilmington and momence dam. it was about 11pm  when me and my nephew decided to go and check the lines we had set about 50 yrds or so away from where we had set out chairs and fire. my gf and other nephew stayed behind. this has happened before on past occasions where i have the feeling someone or thing is watching me run my lines at night. i dont make any big fuss about it as i dont want to startle my nephews, or who is with me on that day. this occasion on july 2 2011, i noticed my nephew that was sitting with my girlfriend at the time i was checking lines that he was fueling the fire to get brighter. when we got back he and my gf both said they heard footsteps behind them with brush moving. i paid them no mind as i didnt hear anything. about 10 min later i heard what sounded like someone walking behind us. i asked them to turn off the flash lights and i went and stood in the little path we walk threw in pitch black just watching. and in the distance to my right about 20 or 30 yards i hear a sort of grunt/growl. but i didnt see anyone. as i walked back to my chair and told them to keep there lights off. my nephew asked my other nephew if he keeps farting hes gonna punch him, i told him thats not a fart its to pungent to smell that way. as i have encountered that smell before on previous visits to that site to fish. after that i here a whooping noise noise behind us in the direction i heard the grunt/growl. i always thought it was like a big geese/goose at night, but we have never seen any at night. since ive herd that noise before it didnt bother me none, as ive herd it before. we ran our lines and packed up to leave about 12:30am as the 4 of us are walking out i got that feeling again that someone is following us back to the bridge to our right. again i dont mention it to my nephews or gf as i dont want to startle them of get them worried and panic as there easy to frighten. 2 days later i had seen one of your shows and herd the exact whooping noise that i had herd. and it got me to think what if it is you know! THE SQuatch. i asked my dad if hes ever herd these noises also as hes gone a few time with me fishing and when he herd the whooping noise and the tree knocking in the distance, he confirmed that he has heard that as well. and my dad is a believer but doesnt acknowledge it. He is the type that says things are out there but if you dont believe it it wont happen, if you go messing with it your gonna find yourself getting the you know what scared out of you. i did some digging on your website and found that there has been sightings near that area/town or county.","south of route 102, on s warner bridge road. under the bridge crossing",Kankakee County,Illinois,Summer,Report 29836: Family experiences strange occurences while fishing Kankakee River,41.207,-88.01345,7/2/2011,29836,Class B,dp36mjw81v,92.23,80.32,68.41,73.79,0.75,0.04,0.04,0,0,,,Humid throughout the day.,9,9.36,244,2.72
"Around 11:23pm on june 20th 2006 my girlfriend, myself, and the dog stepped outside on the back porch so my girlfriend could smoke and to let the dog out to go to the bathroom. The porch faces a wooded tree line area that runs in the backyard and runs through the whole subdivison.  So we open the sliding glass door to step out and we all step on to the porch the dog was still. Then she ran barking straight to the back fence, that is just in front of the tree line area, my girlfriend tells her to be quiet and to stop barking.  She doesn't, then after 5 minutes she stops and we were on our way in, so to see the dog because we couldn't see her I decide to use the display of my cell phone to see if I could see her, because it is a bright display. I see her coming to it but to joke around with her I start waving it around in circles. Then from the back tree line my girlfriend and I both hear this strange 'coo' sound with breaks in it. I freak out and push my girlfriend aside and run in the house; as we were inside and I locked the door. Then I say did you her that and she was like yes what was that, I though it had to have been a bigfoot...It was like nothing I have ever heard in my life.

"I have been walking my dog through Harris Forest Preserve for about 5 weeks now. About the last 3 days we have been walking back there I noticed a foul smell and starge howling noises. I didn't think much of it at the because I've heard alot of coyotes howling in the area. I should also add my dog seemed pretty stressed out and affraid the last couple walks we were on. The last walk we went on was kind of late, from 6 till about 7 pm after dark. We heard quite a few knocks on trees that seemed pretty close by and rocks were being thrown at me and my dog. At first I thought it was some kids screwing around, until I got through the trail to the pond in back. I was paralysed with fear after what happened next. I believe it was a Bigfoot that ran out about 10 feet in front of me and stopped for about 15 seconds, it let out a very loud scream right at me then turned around and ran straight through the pond. I also noticed that behind me appeared to be another very large figure that ran the opposite direction. The first one I got a very clear view of, I was 8 to 9 feet tall with very wide shoulders about twice as wide as mine, it had dark brown hair mixed with some grey, and it smelled awful. I did not get a very good look at the other one but it did appear to be 8 to 10 feet tall. I have never really been a believer and as a matter of fact I am the kind of person more likely to make fun of a believer. That being said I am having a hard time coming up with an explanation for this.

Immediately after the turn there are 2 sharp curves in the road. I down shifted into 2nd gear as I approached the first curve. When down shifting my pipes become quite loud and often pop. As I began the turn in an instant I saw a large figure standing near the edge of the corn along side the road (to my right). Quickly it leaned slightly forward and made a loud higher pitched sound, almost like a scream, or a call. Looking back I would consider that perhaps my pipes scared it.

"I had actually put most of the details out of my mind, until a friend asked me a few months back if I had ever had a sighting. It was October '04 between 9-9:30pm, heading south about 3/4 of the way to Springfield Il. after passing the interchange to go to Lincoln, not sure which county. There weren't many cars on the road. We were in the left lane, I was the passenger. At the very far edge of the high beams I saw what looked like one of those big black 50 gallon lawn bags sitting with a bunch of garbage right off the side of the road between where the pavement meets the grass. It looked like someone had dumped trash... I was wrong! Grant you this all took place in like 8-9 seconds. As we got closer I saw the garbage was fast food bags and the black garbage bag had arms and a head! When we were maybe 5-6 car lengths away it swung its arms out in front of it and shot straight up, taking a small step backwards. My friend and I both said 'what the hell is that?' As he slowed down a little. In the split seconds it was full on in the head lights standing I saw a medium build, not massive at all, but thick, hair was 4-6"" and flat black in color with just a little bluish silver reflection from the headlights and the face was a lighter shade than the hair like charcoal grey, I don't recall seeing breasts and the hair seemed thinner and shorter on its front. Facial features at that speed were impossible to make out, but its chin seemed to jut out from where the collar bone area would be on a human. My friend owned a Mitsubishi Montero at that time. It rode about as high as the smaller big pick up trucks do.

"I recently moved out of my house in Girard, IL. During the last year or so I have experienced several strange occurrences.

"The first sighting was in late Sept to early October of 2003. I apologize for not remembering the date exactly. In the small town of Goodwine, IL on the west side. It was cool weather, clear skies, about 55 to 45 degrees F. The sun had just set and my kids and I had been collecting fire wood for a bonfire from the woods behind our property. I sent them and the dog inside to get ready for dinner. I went back to get a few more pieces of wood. I didn't have a flash light with me at the time and it was starting to get pretty hard to see so I went back to the house and as I walked down the road (which is a dead end road), I got within about 150, 200 feet of the house and that's when this big large dark thing appeared in front of me. It scarred me pretty good not because of its size but it was about 5 to 10 feet from me. It blocked the light from the house and the buildings across the street from our home. it quickly moved to the south into the grass and disappeared. This lasted a good 10 seconds. I then promptly made my way to the house. After a while I told the kids to stay inside and made my way to where it was. I couldn't see any thing nor did I find any sign of that there was any thing there. A few days later my wife said that she saw something out there in about the same location so I went out side and check things out I made my to edge of the property and didn't see anything but I did hear a sound like a hollow log or rail road ties being hit or dropped on each other in the distance. As I went towards the sound it got louder then went away. On my way back going down the same road in about the same place a dark figure looked like it was crouching in the tall grass along the road. I looked at it and continued to walk by it. It never moved nor did I hear any noise. The next morning I noted that the place that I saw this dark figure the night before the grass looked like a deer bed (matted down like when deer bed down in tall grass to sleep) and you could see where it pushed down the grass to leave. My wife told me that she had seen similar things out there in the same area and closer to the house after the two that I saw. Then after a few month of seeing nothing, it was a afternoon full sun and it was a mild day, my wife and I where siting at the kitchen table when a dark figure about 6 foot maybe shorter went down the drive towards the road. I at first thought that my eyes where playing tricks on me so I didn't say anything. Then my wife said did you see that? I replied the dark figure out in the drive. She said yeah. After that she saw another one close to the tree in the front yard by the drive at night with the flood lights on in about the same area where we saw the one in the day light. For note there is a wooded area right across from the house. I have never seen anything like this before nor did I believe that there was anything out there like this. I am a avid sportsmen and backpacker. I have hiked all over and never seen nor heard anything. I have also gone out at night and never came across anything like this.",West side of town.,Iroquois County,Illinois,Fall,Report 14404: Several sightings and strange occurences near a residence west of Goodwine,40.34057,-87.47077,9/6/2003,14404,Class A,dp1v3xc8z7,76.81,63.375,49.94,51.03,0.74,0,0.37,,,rain,1020.39,Clear throughout the day.,8,9.81,7,0.05
"About four years ago I found some foot prints near my drive way, the prints were about six foot apart, you could clearly see the footprints because the day before four inches of snow fell. There were only about eight footprints in total. We have a fence around our pond, the fence from the end of our drive is about ten, twelve yards away. The prints came from the road towards our pond, funny thing is they died out at the fence. I tried to track it but it left behind no prints that I could find after it went over our fence.The night before I found the footprints near our driveway, I heard my dog going towards the end of our drive sounding like he was wanting to attack something, I thought it was coyotes so I went outside but I didn't hear or see anything.

"I was out late one night cat fishing at Clinton Lake by myself. I had been there for probably a couple hours and hadn't really been catching much. I had talked to a few people who were coming in on boats and seen a few going out. It seemed like a normal night for the most part. About an hour after I had seen the last person left, I was starting to get the feeling I was being watched. I shrugged it off because I know there are raccoons, possums, coyotes, even stray dogs and cats. So I dismiss it and resume my fishing. After awhile I notice how quiet it is. All I can hear is the faint breeze and the water lapping on the boat ramp where im sitting. Right about now I'm starting to get spooked. I know when there's a predator of some kind around that this usually happens. I'm an avid duck hunter, and a die hard cat fisherman, so I'm used to traipsing around in the dark. I figure its just a coyote eyeballing me so I get my flashlight and get up to take a look around. I look around for a bit and don't see anything. I once again put this out of my head, starting to think I'm losing my mind. After a little while longer I still notice there isn't any sound. As I'm sitting there staring across the lake, the hair on my arms and neck starts to stand up. I don't really spook that easy but when the hair stands up, something is watching you. I decided that I had all I could stand and threw all my stuff in my truck and left. On my way home I called dad and told him what was going on. He told me back in the  70's, there was sightings of what the town called the Salt Creek monster. I'm no skeptic, but at the same time I haven't ever seen it. After a while he tells me I should go back and check the place out a little more closely. I decided it was probably a good idea just for some peace of mind. I drive back out to the boat launch, and park in the parking lot. I have the truck lights on as well as my flashlight that I'm scanning the area with. After about 15 minutes I give up and go to leave. As I'm turning around in the parking lot, the truck lights pick something up standing in the trees. I immediately stomp on the brakes. About 20 yards away I'm looking at something that's probably seven feet tall, not overly muscular but it was covered in  black hair. It also had a big pair of yellow eyes.    It had a deer in the head lights look about it and it tore off running through the trees along the lake. I had been in track in high school and this easily outpaced the fastest runners I'd ever seen. When it ran it didn't pump its arms. They just swayed a bit. Before I really understood what I was seeing it was gone. I drove my little truck as fast as it could go all the way home. I called my dad back and remember being on the edge of hysteria. After that I always had my gun in the truck, which was always within sprinting distance of where I was fishing.","You would take Illinois Rt 54 out of Farmer City going west, then take a left onto Liberty Road, or as the maps say 2225 E.",De Witt County,Illinois,Summer,Report 28110: Night fisherman has sighting at Clinton Lake boat docks,40.19732,-88.724,6/27/2009,28110,Class A,dp0utj9nkg,89.98,80.01,70.04,63.47,0.64,0.09,0.18,0.0003,0.59,rain,1010.89,Light rain overnight.,11,10,174,2.43
"I went for a hike at lunchtime in a newly made path that cuts through the Timber Ridge Forest Preserve. This path is surrounded by about 8 ponds. It has been very cold and snowy here in the teens and 20's for almost a month except for one warm day that melted the snow. All this melt caused the crushed gravel path to act like a white clay, making all the hikers/dogs/coyotes footprints visible in a 30 foot area. Along with these prints are bare footprints about 13 "" long. Looking at the 5 pictures I took, they're deeper set than all the other shoe prints, with 5 distinct toes.

We were going really slow because of deer at night, so while me and the boy we conversing on and off there from my side of the road comes a maybe 7 foot creature with the most beautiful chestnut long hair that covered all of its body just jogging across the front of my car crossing over the headlights. It used no effort to cross but it sure did cover allot of land in a very short time. Me and the boy watched it cross the car and go into the woods: then we looked at each other and kinda screamed, shouted to each other: Did you just see that? We answered each other at the same time and then I told the boy lets drive down the way and see if we can catch up to it, so we did, but to no avail. He had disappeared.

"I had been at my camper out past Canton Lake on N. Martin Rd. finishing a sculpture which was my project for the day. It had just gotten dark so I can guess the time. Having no flashlight I stepped into the road to begin the long walk back to Canton. I lit a cigarette and heard a small knock in the thin group of trees behind me. I turned, looked in the trees, seeing nothing I began walking. Down the road I went. It was a bit chilly. I knew walking would warm me up. I had just enough light to see the road ahead, the night sky was a shade lighter than the trees. About 10 minutes of walking I had just become more at ease with the night time walk when a great noise happened in the road ahead of me (about 30 ft.), like a cow falling into the loose gravel. I strained my eyes to see what it was.  A crumpled shadowy figure stood up. Human? I thought to myself, ""that must have hurt."" Yet I hadn't heard any groan or speech during the fall. It walked calmly across the road. This is when its legs were seen, a lighter shade of road behind them. Biped for sure, but, too muscley. Some light glinted off the fur. It was animal. I know when I am seeing an animal, and not a snowsuit. Biped! I just seen sasquatch (a strange thin, tall, muscley one). And I still had to get on by where it disappeared into the shadows again. A house to the left had a garage light, which dimly lit up the yard, nothing crossed the yard. My impression was that thing ducked behind a bush and was still laying there when I finished walking by. I think these creatures are mostly nocturnal and curious, but they really just want to be left alone.

"After a late concert at the square in Canton, Illinois, my friend was bicycling home and turned right into the parking lot, that leads past a shed, fence, and dumpster. Hearing a shuffling bang noise near the dumpster, she slowed her bike and began looking. Behind the shed was more than a noise. A shadowy sasquatch shape. Its puffy balloon feet (as she described it), held up a stocky, not so tall frame (6 ft.). Startled, it turned and walked into the bushes, moving branches to get into the woods.This was a thinly wooded area, and on the other side, a corn field. So freaked out she said, ""what is that?"", and sped right home and told me. I could tell she was worried, and by her description, this did happen. We discused the situation further (5 minutes), then decided I should go check it out. She locked the doors and I got on my bike. I sped around the corner keeping my pedals quiet. The noise, there was the noise. I pulled over behind a pine tree, and quietly snuck up beside the fence staying low. At the minute I was ready, I turned on the flashlight under the fence. No feet were there.  But that noise, was it inside the dumpster? So I slowly snuck around the corner. Only one cover of the four covers was open on the dumpster, so when I was ready, I shown the light through it. A small coon was trapped. Unable to climb out of an almost empty dumpster. It was out of breath, and sad looking, so I put small cans and an old sign in to give it a ladder out. I went back later that evening and the coon was out and to check the shadows around there.  We think it heard the coon also, and may have ben trying to find a way inside. We dont know if it was hungry, or just trying to help the coon out.

"The following phone interview was conducted by Stan Courtney. Because the witnesses do not have Internet access, the information was entered with their permission. The first names of the witnesses have been changed. Tom: I told John about my sighting of the 2nd of June 2005 and he and his son went with me to the location. This was about a week after my first sighting. Right about 30 feet before the bend in the road I parked my car there and I was showing John where I saw the animal the first time. And we heard some commotion over in the woods and we were looking down into the trees. John was the first one to spot the silhouette and he asked me to come over, I guess my eyesight is a little better, and he said ""Hey, what does that look like to you?"" And then that was the time when we both saw its arm move and so I get on the hood of the car and I tried to get a better look 'cause I was going to see if it was either a shadow or three dimensional. I was trying to get looks of it from all angles without losing sight of the thing. It was standing motionless on the back side of a tree and you could see the majority of the body, he wasn't hiding behind a tree he was more leaning against it. That is when after we noticed the arm movement I'm on top of the hood of the car. Something caught my notice out of the corner of my eye to the right of the silhouette. Out in plain sight, plain as day there was an actual fur bodied, walking, probably 10 to 20 feet away from the silhouette I saw a smaller one and this one was starting to walk where the trees thin out it started to make its way to where the trees get thicker, and just walking. So at this time, I tell John, ""There's another one."" And he says, ""Where, where?"" And I point in the general direction, I jump down off the car and run into the woods after it. It didn't run until I got about 20 feet in, that's when its pace picked up. It brought its elbows real high as it was running. And then I lost sight of it, because I didn't know that the ground actually sloped down. By time I got back to the hill I couldn't see it. Stan Courtney: Okay, when you started chasing the smaller one what had happened to the bigger one? Tom: I really couldn't tell you. I made a beeline straight for the one in front of me. John and his son were watching the big one. Stan: When you first saw the big one and you just saw a silhouette why did you think it was a bigfoot? Tom: At first I didn't know what to think. If anything it could be a man in a suit. When I saw the second one in the clearing as plain as day, I guess I don't know how to explain it but I just knew it wasn't a man at that time. Stan: What about the first animal? What did you see? John: When a truck came down the hill and around the bend the animal turned its head very slowly and smoothly and watched it pass by. Then it slowly turned its head back. Tom: I didn't see the head turn. Stan: What about the hand movement? Tom: Actually we saw the silhouette of the body, and as we were watching this thing the arm comes up as if to touch its face. And then we see the hand go back down. And I mean this was slow motion, it moved up as slow as it went down slow. Stan: How long did you watch it? Tom: From the time we saw the silhouette of the big one in the trees till the time I saw the little one was probably five minutes. I remember telling John ""We could stand here all day and this thing is going to wait longer than us."" John: I kept looking at the first, larger animal. I concentrated on watching it. When Tom got half-way into the woods I glanced over to see where he and the smaller animal were.

"Ok,  first off, I am not a skeptic nor am I what people consider a loon. After hearing about the investigation a few years ago near Seneca. I found little interest in the story of the DuPont Monster, having lived around this general area most of my life urban legends are just that.

"The evening of April 15, 2011 I was with fellow BFRO investigator Eric L. and BFRO enthusiast Sam. We were on a trail in the Shawnee National Forest southeast of Equality, IL.  We were using Sam's thermal imaging monocular (L-3 Comm. X200xp ). We had traveled on the trail up a slight incline and occasionally either doing a howl or some whoops. When we got to our point before we decided to turn back. During our return we started getting some return howls four to be exact over about a five minute period. This was confirmed by several others in our camp. Shortly after, on our way back to base camp, I saw a heat signature. This was rather a bright heat source, different from any of the deer heat source we had observed both before and after this. This ""Heat source"" was behind a tree first observed on the left side of the tree. It then disappeared only to reappear on the right side.

"My friend and I were out arrowhead hunting. It was late September 1985. We were driving looking for a good spot when I spotted a ridge that was a wash out. I told her to pull over and hunt there because it was off the beaten path. I climbed to the top and spied a cornfield. So we proceeded to hunt the field. The corn stalks were small that year and you could see the whole area. In the fence row was what I thought was a black tree that was topped off.   But, I kept getting the feeling I was being watched. At closer observation of the object it was like it was grinning at me. This was in the space of a half an hour. I looked around for my friend and she was nowhere to be found. So I beat it back to her car. She was right behind me. She said, ""Did you see that?"" And I said half jokingly, ""what Bigfoot?"" She said, ""you seen it too?"" I told her I thought it was a tree that was cut off at the top. But, I had the creepy feling someone was watching me,and kept looking back at it. We drove around and I said we have to go back. We did and my ""tree"" was gone. I've told different people about it. They think I'm nuts I'm glad I wasn't the only one there. I rarely see her but every time I do she always brings it up.

We decided to take a break and go target practicing behind the farm. We were standing by the creek shooting targets on the ice. I looked down and saw a footprint in the ice. It was big. The creek was approximately 6ft wide and ankle deep unfroze. I told my uncle and he said ""Yeah its a weird looking track, it looks like a foot.""  It had five toes. It was twice the size of a normal human's foot. On the other side of the creek there was a heel print on the other side where the water met the bank.

This vocalization set off a series of responses from other wildlife up and down the river for the next three or four minutes.

"Some neighbors and I went four wheeling on our dirt bikes and quads. It was about 6:30 PM when we left. About 9:30 PM we stopped to repair a chain on one of the bikes. We were all gathered around his bike when we all heard a moan that sounded like a cross between a tornado warning siren and wolf howl. We all froze while we listened to this thing moan about 5 or 6 times. The lead rider in our group grabbed his rifle out of his case. He hikes out into these woods all the time and I've never seen him grab a weapon to defend himself against anything in these woods. After the moans subsided we waited frozen there for about 30 seconds when we heard about 6 knocks like someone hitting their knuckles against a tree. We were all frozen stiff in fear. Nobody made any movements. After we heard the knocks we started hearing something run through the woods. It sounded like it was running really fast. As soon as we heard this we abandoned the bike and jumped on our vehicles while Mark rode on the back of my quad on the way back. We went back to that spot the next day around noon and the bike was not on the trail where we left it. It was about 5 ft off the trail into the brush, as if it had been tossed there. We never found any footprints or anything of that sort but I am positive after hearing the same noises on the sound clips on this site that what we encountered was a sasquatch.","Take I-64 to wheatonville rd and cross on to North road, you see a bunch of trucks parked on the side of the road, the incident happened about 5 miles into the woods.",Warrick County,Indiana,Summer,"Report 15374: Possible vocalizations outside of Elberfeld, Indiana",38.1579,-87.41805,7/2/2006,15374,Class B,dncc4f2jgu,93.84,83.145,72.45,67.21,0.61,0,0.22,0,0,,1019.65,Clear throughout the day.,11,10,226,3.58
"I  have been reluctant to beleive what my mother says because she has always been a little squirrley, it runs in her family, but she told me several years back that my uncle was outside one night drunk as usual, another reason i was reluctant to believe her, but the story goes that something big and hairy got after him and he crawled up under the pickup truck to keep it from getting him. They live in southern Indiana in a remote area. They own about 60 acres that was my grandmothers. The area is rolling hills some big enough to be considered mountains. It lies northwest of Louisville, KY and east of Paoli Peaks, IN, a fairly well known ski resort town. I often wondered about the things they say they have seen and heard in the woods. They live about 3/4 of a mile back off the road in a trailer in the middle of a thick woods with alot of tall cedar and pine trees oaks and walnut trees also. the woods is heavy with alot of undergrowth and alot of sink holes and caves. Houses are spaced out in the area with alot of other heavily wooded properties joining theirs.

"The first Tuesday of August 2011 I was pulling up to a hunting area, I had parked the car and was getting ready to get out and get my gear. It was a little bit after 4 o'clock in the morning because I had just dropped my wife off at work so it was still two hours before sunup. So, I was sitting there, getting ready to get my gear when all of a sudden a just got this chill all over me, the hair stood up on the back of my neck, my arms, and something inside just told me ""don't get out of the car"". So I sat there, I drank a 16 oz Full Throttle energy drink, so with my kidney problems in the past, kidney stones, when I have to go I have to go or my kidneys start hurting. So I finally broke down and stepped out of the car, I didn't even step completely out of the car, I was between the car and the door. I caught this brief scent that smelt skunky and musky. But it was really, really light so I didn't really think a whole lot about it. I didn't have a flashlight shining around at the time because I didn't think I would be in the woods long before the sun would come up. I figured I would go out there and catch an hour or two nap before the sun came up. So, I got back in the car and an hour later I had to relieve myself again. I got out, I didn't hear anything, I didn't see anything and this time I didn't smell anything. So I relieved myself and got back in the car. I waited for sunup, where it started getting light enough so you could see where you are going. I walked down the trail to this pond, which is on the north side of the fire access road. And I sat there for about fifteen, twenty minutes and I came back up to the road and I started walking east on the fire access road. I came across this turkey scratch in the middle of the gravel pad, it was hard packed with a light dust on it. And there was a beautiful track, the toes were visible. I took a picture of it with my hunting boot which is a 10 EEE beside it for comparison. It was so fresh in that dust the picture showed up really good. However, when I went back the next day due to the wind the track was no longer visible because the dust is so light, which tells me it was an extremely fresh track because you can see from the photo that the track is plainly visible with very good definition considering the dusting ground that it was on.",,Alexander County,Illinois,Summer,Report 40474: Hunter finds a possible footprint near Olive Branch,37.18404,-89.36896,8/2/2011,40474,Class B,dn87w35s8r,96.52,88.64,80.76,72.02,0.69,0.09,0.11,0,0,,1011.73,Foggy in the morning and humid throughout the day.,10,7.25,173,2.7
"October 10th, 2011, it was a Tuesday morning I believe, no it wouldn’t be a Tuesday morning because I was out here in the afternoon. I was walking down that trail on the next ridge over. I was just coming back from the other campsite over there that somebody had made. I had been doing tree knocks and whoops to no avail, no sound, no return calls or anything and when I came back off the ridge to the main fire access trail I noticed a large pile of feces. No, first I saw the footprint. It measured nineteen inches long, seven and a quarter inches wide at the ball of the foot where the toes connect and it was five and a half inches wide at the heel. I saw that and I said “XXXX!” And then I looked down and started measuring it and everything and I walked a little and that is exactly what I found was a pile of feces. The makeup of it was vegetable matter, mostly vegetable matter, crayfish, shells from the skull part not the tails. I guess they can’t digest the hard shell of it. And there was also mollusks, fresh water mollusks shell mixed up in the feces, and I took a picture of that and accidentally mishandled that photo and accidentally got deleted when I tried to transfer it to my memory card and to my computer. And I took maybe two or three steps after that and I looked up and saw… he was seven to seven and a half feet tall, I’m guessing, he was probably bigger, I was terrified at the time. He was maybe three hundred, three hundred-fifty lbs. And he was about eighty feet away, seventy to eighty feet and he closed half that distance in three steps before he veered off the hill at a forty-five degree angle, ran down the ridge which is about an eight per cent grade for about maybe about 150 feet and then hits the valley of the two ridges and went up the next ridge which is about as steep and tall. So fast you couldn’t match it on a horse, motorcycle, three-wheeler even if it was paved. It was digging up a ground hornet’s nest and later I discovered by looking on line that hornets make what is known as hornet honey which is a concentrated nectar mixed with insect protein that they store with the larva. Now it’s not in large doses from my understanding but if you was to dig up an entire hornet’s nest (as the picture of the hornet’s nest you have that he dug up) you could get quite a nice little bit of nutrition from that much. If he made any sound it was no louder than say a squirrel moving through the leaves which for something so large moving and so fast is amazing. The bulk of its chest was just unbelievably broad, thick and dense. You could see the muscles moving. As it was running through, it was partly cloudy and there were still some leaves on the trees, and as it was running it ran through a bit of light coming through the canopy I could see that’s fur was dark brownish with a really bright red tint to it when the sun hit it directly. And he was gone up this other ridge and I collected my stuff and started running back to my car.",,Alexander County,Illinois,Fall,Report 36246: Hiker has daylight sighting near Olive Branch.,37.18404,-89.36896,10/10/2011,36246,Class A,dn87w35s8r,80.02,69.965,59.91,55.5,0.72,0.23,0.46,0,0,,1019.16,Partly cloudy starting in the afternoon.,5,9.64,130,1.18

"The following on-site interview was conducted by Stan Courtney on the 2nd of Nov 2010. The first name of the witness has been changed. Stan - How long have you been coming out here? Mark - I've been coming out here longer than I want to say, it's like early 1970's. Stan - And then how long have you been coming out here as a researcher? [ Bachelors Grove Cemetery in Cook County Forest Preserve ] Mark - I've been here, on and off, for ages. But the last three or four years I've been out here a lot. I'll spend an entire day just walking through the woods. That is when I started noticing things and I never realized what it may have been. [ A large teepee, pyramid structure, Cook County Forest Preserve ] Stan - The area we are standing next to right now, I don't know whether you would call it a structure but it is a group of about ten or fifteen trees that have all been pushed as a big teepee-like structure. Mark - They have been bent, they aren't all dead either. Stan - Has this structure always been here? Mark - I can't remember. Back in the 1980's I never really came back here that much, but it has been here the last ten years or so. And at one point there was much more of a structure. Somebody or something has taken some of it apart. Stan - Other than this particular structure have you found other things that you found interesting? [ One of several live trees that appear to be bent over and pinned to the ground, Cook County Forest Preserve ] Mark - Yes, there are unusual bent trees through-out the woods. I've never understood what goes around pulling full-grown trees over. If a tree breaks in a storm they usually snap or they de-root, these are just broken like at a four, five or six foot level like they have been yanked, fibers are still all connected, it just appears to be pulled over, there are dozens of them throughout the woods. In the area we are standing in now, there are all these broken logs all over the place. Stan - Have you been out here at night? Mark - Yeah, but not for ages, when I was a kid we did. But there are weird noises here. I have heard numerous stories of weird howls and growling. Stan - What have you heard yourself? Mark - I have heard deep growling before, just a couple times and I don't know what it is. It wasn't wind, there was definitely some real deep gruffy kind of moaning, growling sounds. Stan - What about footsteps? Have you ever heard footsteps? Mark - Oh yeah, you hear those out here a lot, but there are deer out here and everything, but sometimes when you walk down the path, that path is quite aways through the middle of the woods to get out here, and you're being followed sometimes. I come out here myself when there is no one else around and I'll swear I'm being followed sometimes. Stan - Earlier today there were sirens going off and we did hear what I thought was a howl. It was about 200 yards distant. So we heard something this morning that I don't think was a siren. Mark - I actually did at first but after I started listening it was a different noise than the siren. Stan - What about smells? Mark - Others report weird smells, real like freaky dead smells, that will come all of a sudden all over you. Stan - And you've smelled that? Mark - Yeah, I don't know how to describe it, we just call it death, kind of a weird freaky smell. Stan - This is an interesting area and of particular interest to me is that it is in Cook County. We're not talking about a so-called wilderness. Tell me about this woods and does this connect to other woods. Mark - This is actually the biggest section of woods in all of Cook County, it's massive, it runs from one side of the county to the other. If you look on a map it's huge, you might have to cross a street but once you cross you're in another massive forest preserve. Something could hide here anywhere it wanted. The woods go into Will County, it is a gigantic forest preserve. Stan - Does it connect up to any rivers or major streams? Mark - Yes, you can get to that side too, this actually goes all the way to IL 45. On the west side of IL 45 this runs all the way up to 55, the Interstate, this is just a massive area. All you have to do is just cross the street. Stan - In other words, nothing would have to be permanent in here. Mark - No, something in here could be cross town in the next day with no problem, and basically we are on the fringes where there are still rural areas. The woods are so interconnected that technically something could walk from here to the Joliet area if it wanted to, going at night it could just cross the fields. Stan - Do you ever get that watched feeling in the daytime? Mark - I actually got it today, I was going to ask you. There are days when I come out here I know I am being watched, just don't know from where. Sometime you come out here it's like being in the park, it's a nice beautiful forest reserve, and other times you come out it is just so creepy, you just feel like there are eyes everywhere. Stan - And did you say that you had stuff thrown at you before? Mark - Numerous things we've had things thrown at us, not acorns but those bigger nuts. They've actually smacked us before. I was out here with a friend where we had a log, six inch thick by six foot long physically fly out of the trees and land within about three feet of us. Then we actually left, looked up and said ""We can take a hint"" and then we walked out of here. Its just logs don't fall out of the sky very often. Stan - Have you ever experienced a bluff charge? Mark - No. There are deer out here too, but you will also hear something crunching because this is thick woods and then all of a sudden you hear nothing. Stan - Have you ever heard woodknocks? Mark - You know, to be honest, I probably haven't paid attention, I might have, I never looked at it from this point of view. We have a huge deer population, we have water right there. These are such thick woods, we're talking fall now, you should see this place in the summer, you can't see in here at all. Stan - It's a beautiful forest preserve. Mark - Yes, it is a neat forest and it is exciting to find out that what we have been seeing and hearing is indicative of possible sasquatch activity.",Bachelors Grove Cemetery which is near the intersection of 143rd Street and Ridgeland Avenue.,Cook County,Illinois,Fall,Report 28525: Possible vocalizations and stick structures found in Bachelors Grove Cemetery,41.63243,-87.76622,11/2/2010,28525,Class B,dp3sfffw6z,51.77,42.94,34.11,30.51,0.64,0.03,0.87,0,0,,1029.99,Clear throughout the day.,3,10,102,2.13
"I am going to be honest, before this happened, when it comes to bigfoot, I have been very skeptical, because there is not enough evidence that would make me even consider that there could be a bigfoot. It was about 8:15 in the morning, I was just driving the car. I was on 1st Avenue, I had gotten off I - 55, I was heading over to visit my mother at her job. I was driving near Zoo Woods, which is some sort of forest area. I was driving and I was on the phone and I looked to my right and I saw something very, very tall, like between 8 and 9 foot and hairy. It was running through the woods. I remember the sun reflecting off the outside of the fur and it gave it like an orange tint. A Golden Retriever has that color hair, make that a little darker and with a little bit more copper-tone, more red-head feel to it. I think that would be the color I am trying to describe. I stopped in mid-traffic, I put my hazards on, I pulled over right away. I had just seen something moving through the trees, nine foot tall, orange fur, it just kind of ran through about five feet of brush. The trees were moving, I saw it.  I slammed on my brakes, got out of my car, put my hazards on, I ran over to where I saw it, because I had already passed it over, passed by it. I had to run back a little bit to go in the area where I saw it. There were broken tree branches. I couldn't see any prints, no fur, no evidence besides the broken trees. There was a terrible odor, like a musky, wet dog smell, maybe worse than that, more putrid. It was like if you are running through the woods and you are nine feet tall and you are about ten feet into the woods before the outside of the woods stopped, that's how far into the woods it was. It had arms, it was running and it was very big. I only told a couple of people, and then I let it go.","I was headed north on 1st Avenue (IL - 171). I remember seeing the sign that said Zoo Woods.

"We went to check out Bachelor's Grove yesterday. We saw the pyramid and the arched tree that was posted in . We also heard a siren, or something, exactly like what was posted in that same report. Not sure what it was, but it came from the direction of the road. I found a footprint with a broad heal and wide ball, deeply impressed into muddy soil. Other, less distinct heal prints were seen in an apparent trackway. I think it's about 15.5 inches long. The print was old, and there was some debris in it. Looks like there may have been some drag as well, but it was rather clear that there were toes. I should say prints, as I found 2 or 3 more heel impressions back from it, with about a 7 foot stride, but they were hard to make out, as other stuff had torn up the trail, so I didn't photograph them. I also could make out impressions in the dirt on the trail going in, that looked to have been made by a foot of about the same size. These were barely noticeable in the dirt, but there were three, with about a 7 foot stride. I would venture to say less than a month old, maybe only two weeks. That trail is very packed, and very traveled, so the must have been made just after a good rain. We did occasionally hear what we thought might have been voices. Really quiet, like someone was mumbling off in the brush. Never saw anything living, apart from squirrels, deer, birds, and fish.","The deep prints were found on the trail which follows the abandoned section of the Midlothian Turnpike past Bachelors Grove Cemetery, just beyond the abandoned settlement of Bachelors Grove.

I was driving home from a girlfriends house in the early hours of the morning on a late summer night. Patches of ground fog were scattered about over the fields. As I drove up to a ninety degree turn in the road my headlight shown on a figure in a bean field that boardered a corn field. The headlights caused the eyes to shine red and I could make out the shape of a large figure. It was standing in an area of the fog and its head and upper body were above the fog. It was as tall as the corn in the field next to it. Since the figure was next to the corn field (standing in the beans) it gave frame of referance for height.  It was as tall as the corn which in Indiana at that time of the year is at least seven to eight feet tall. I could not make out facial features or hair because of the fog and the fact that it was at least twenty yards into the field. I turned at the curve and punched the gas. My hair was standing up on my arms and head and it really scared me. I was by myself so I was not about to hang around.

"My girlfriend and I were fishing on Glen Flint Lake in Putnam Co. IN.  I would say it was about 1 am.  We heard a coyote, or coyotes barking and making yipping noises, then we heard several loud grunt like noises, almost moan like, very loud similar to what a bear sounds like, then a coyote let out a scream like sound, like it was getting hurt.  Then it got quiet.  I pulled up our anchors, and left.  I have camped all over the United States, I've camped in remote parts of Canada.  I have never heard anything like that.

"These are  my husband and his family's accounts.  The first sighting was in 1953. The Tippecanoe River runs beside a cluster of cottages near the little town of Winamac, in northern Indiana. A long suspension bridge, spans the river, and was the only means of getting to the five cottages, other than by boat. At each end, flood lights were mounted, and at night, each lighted the bridge half way across. The bank of the river was rather steep.  Behind the group of cottages, the woods was thick and dense. Children were not allowed to wander there, and play was confined largely to the area right around the cabins. Two brothers, each with large families, had come for the weekend to enjoy fishing, boating, and just generally, being together. My husband, one of the children, was then about five. On this particular day, a group of little girls, his sisters and cousins, were playing between two of the cabins. The grownups, and some of the children, were inside. About the middle of the day, terrified screams came from the group of girls. When the adults, hearing the screams, ran outside, they found the girls crying hysterically, and pointing towards the woods. A huge creature, about seven feet tall, walking on two legs, covered from head to toe, with long dark hair, was walking the other way, towards the treeline. He was walking upright, on two feet. One child was saying that it had touched her, others were saying that it had just one eye. A rifle was was brought out from the cabin, and  one man, my husband's father took aim. He had the beast in his site, held the gun for a few seconds, and then lowered it. Cries of, ""Shoot him,"" could not persuade him to fire at the beast. When asked later, why he didn't shoot, he said, ""I was afraid that I might be shooting a man."" One of his children, now, my husband, came running outside with the adults and saw the creature's back as he walked towards, and into  the woods. Ten years later, in 1963, my husband,(then  fifteen), and his family, were once again spending the week in one of the cottages. Late one night, after all the others had gone to bed, he was down on one of the docks. Loving the river at night, he often walked it's banks. On this particular night, he began to hear a movement coming from behind the cabins at the edge of the woods.  He walked up the bank, and went around to the back of the cabin to see what was making such a ruckus. There, in the darkness, coming out of the woods slowly, was the same creature that had frightened the family ten years ago. He ran back to the front porch, hurried into the house, and woke up his father. The two of them, without waking the others, went onto the screened porch, which was in front, towards the river, and in the darkness, with a 22 rifle and only the bridge lights shining, they waited. They began to smell a terrible stench, like that of rotten meat, getting worse as the creature neared them. This cabin was right next to the bridge. They knew that if the creature was going to cross it, he would walk right by them, about ten feet away, and pass under the light. Inside the cabin, the family dog was beginning to whine. They stood quietly, and soon the creature was beside them, about ten feet away. He seemed to be intent on going for the bridge. As he passed the porch, he turned and looked towards the teen and his father, but seemed not to see them, and didn't regard them in any way, nor, the dog, which was now howling, and tearing at the door. The creature made his way to the bridge. As he passed under the floodlight on the cabin side, he was clearly seen, as huge, covered with dark hair, and walking upright like a man. The smell was horrible. When he got to the bridge, he went down on all fours and began to cross it using his arms and hands, as well as his feet. When he passed the half way mark on the bridge, and neared the other side of the bridge, the dog was let out on the porch and crashed through the screen door, running after the creature. It raced across the bridge. By this time, the creature had crossed the bridge and was in the darkness beyond. The teen and his father could only guess what was happening by the sounds they heard - growling, fighting noises, and then whimpering and yelping. The dog came back to the cabin covered with cuts and blood. The only other time that anyone said that the creature had been seen was an account told to me by my husband's neice, who often stayed in the same cabin as a child.  She said she woke up one morning and saw a large, yellow, hairy creature looking through the door.  He left quickly.  This was about 1976.","All the sightings were near the Dentwood cabins, right off River Road, just outside of Winamac.",Pulaski County,Indiana,Summer,Report 9245: Family has several sightings at a summer cabin near Winamac.,41.062,-86.5945,1/22/2005,9245,Class A,dp63t7pg3z,17.95,8.04,-1.87,7.27,0.7,0.94,0.42,,,snow,,Snow (< 1 in.) in the morning.,2,4.6,23,7.13
"The first incident was in Febuary of 2009 after a snow. Me and my daughter who was 5 at the time went to Shades State Park to play. I was goofing around and making tree knocks every 15 minutes or so. I did not expect anything but any time I'm in the woods I try. We were making our way back to the truck and were within 500 yards when I made another set of knocks wich was followed almost immediatly by a very loud and powerfull growl. My daughter immediatly looked at me and said what is that dad. Halving my 5 year old with me made me just want to get her to the truck asap. The power and intensity was really something, it reminded me of passing a snow plow on the road, just the power of it. The following summer a couple of things happened I think are related. In june me and my buddy who like to whitewater kayak went to the Shades, Pine Hills area to kayak due to some heavy rains and flooding,wich in Indiana is the only good runs we get. That day while standing along suger creek at our buddys cottage which is across from the spot Indian creek enters suger creek we were debating how safe Indian creek would be to run when for some reason a deer jumped into the water and tried to swim across, it did not make it and got sucked under a log jam under the covered bridge. That was our sign and we descided tomorrow would be a better idea. We met around 10:30 the next day and Kayaked Indian creek which was still running fast but safer. As we was leaving Indian creek and entering suger creek at the spot we were at the day before except on the other side, I noticed to my left along the cliff face was a stack of rocks about a foot and a half tall stacked right on top of each other. What was odd was this area was still quite flooded and the area was completely under water the day before. There is know person in there right mind that would halve been in that spot over night or that morning. My last incident was in July 2009. I was catfishing about 1 am at lake Waveland about 1 to 2 miles from the Shades and Pine Hills area. I heard very cleary three short howls coming from the area around Shades. And the whole time this thing was howling every coyote in the area was going nuts. As soon as it stopped everything went silent, it was really cool I pretty much knew at that point for once and for all that sasquatch is a real and living creature, very cool.

"Myself and two other people were backpacking in the Hoosier National Forest. We had setup a camp in a valley off the grub ridge loop trail (this is a 10 mile loop, were about 4-5 miles deep in the woods). We were sitting by our camp fire (it was about 1:00 am). We heard a loud vocalization (it almost sounded like a very deep growl, and then a howl). It honestly sounded like an ape. We then heard what sounded like a large branch or tree being snapped in half and then thrown towards us (this happened a couple times). We then heard a loud commotion coming from the woods, we heard what sounded like a small animal being attacked, making a distressed crying noise (I think it was a rabbit, but I'm not sure. It sounded like it was being killed). This went on for 20-30 seconds, and then silence. We then heard something run off through the woods. I could hear branches breaking and leaves rustling, by the racket it made running, it sounded large. You could hear it's body brushing through the trees. There are no bears or Mt. Lions in this area. I've grown up here and know what a coyote sounds like and it was not a coyote. I am honestly stumped as to what we encountered.

"hey i just happened to stumble upon this website. last year october 24 2009, me, my friend, and his dad where waterfowl hunting on monroe lake, in monroe county, we were set up on a peninsula on the farthest point with two small bays behind us to our right and left. we have gone to the peninsula before multiple times to waterfowl hunt.and we went out early morning when it was still dark. everything was normal. no birds flying though. so we were just stitting on our colapsable chairs facing the water looking by this time it was about 5 mins. after sunrise so still pretty dark. it was my friend on my right and his dad on my left, since we were shooting shot guns they were loud so i had ear plugs in. and then this extremely loud roar/ moan comes from the right bay. the moment i heard it i though it was a dog.. but it kept going and got even louder and then dropped to a very low moan/ growl . the roar / moan lasted about 8 to 10 seconds, keep in mind i had ear plugs in and i still heard that noise crystal clear. we all three stood up and just stood facing the other side of the right bay and didnt see anything ( only a beaver in the middle of the bay. the bay was about 60 yards across. me and my friend were terrified and had no idea what made that noise. not paying attention to hunting we stood there scared to death. now i need to ephasize the loudness of the roar it was extrememly extremely loud. and i looked over to my friend about 2 mins after the first noise. and i said man i wish we could hear it again. what do you know . we hear it again but it sounded much farther away. and sounded the exact same as the first noise. we were shocked . now us being hunters we knew just about any indiana wildlife there is to know about and all the noises they make. and what we heard that day was nothing like i have ever heard in my life. so then not hunting any longer we remainded standing there facing the right bay listening. we dont hear anything else. we didnt see and birds flying that whole morning so about 12 noon we pack up and start to walk back to where our car was parked about a 5 min walk with the gear so about 300 yards away. the path we took that morning was on the bank of the right bay... as you would think we kept our shot guns loaded on our walk back to the car.we pack up and get on our way. the spot we where in was not very populated at all there was a dnr check station about a mile down the road and some houses on the windie road back to bloomington. now if you know any thing about monroe are is how hilly it is and the questions we kept asking our selves was , what was that noise...? and how could if have traveled so quick to hear agian so far away? our gueses we made where - bared owl?, mule deer? dog? some sort of bear..? but we all quickly ruled out of the those. the closest was the dog. but the roar/ moan was so loud and the last 3 sec dropped to a low low growl/ mumble and no dog could make that loud of a howl of any sort. it wasnt till about half way through the 2 hour drive home to indianapolis. that my friends dad said it could have been some college kids joking around  since it was around halloweenwith a mega phone. but then we said why would college kids be up at 630 go deep into monroe forest find 3 hunters in complete camoflauge and make that noise. just none of our guesses were making sinse with that noise we heard. its not till we got back to my friends house and got on the computer and immedialely started looking up moans and roars. none matched we tried every animal noise in indiana and then we were on youtube and a video popped up . the title said bigfoot noises and pictures . thats when me and my friend look at each other and said oh my god . quickly clicking on the video a picture of so called ""big foot' showed up and then a audio started. the noise on the video was EXACTILY the same noise we hear that morning hunting. then we go to another bigfoot recording . it was very similiar to what we heard, and another and another and all the videos we listnend to matched up just right with what we heard or very close to what we heard. now before this incedent we would always make fun of the bigfoot tv shows and the people who believe in big foot. but i do not  make fun of that any more. me and my friend still talk about it today about what we heard on october 22 2009. me and my friend are both believers of big foot. or not big foot but some unknown creature that is out there and no one can seem to pin point what it is so they use the name ""bigfoot"" we never did go back to the peninsula on monroe lake that hunting year. but we did go back in october again this year to the same exact spot. we didnt hear anything but that time we didnt go back to the spot across the right bay to where we heard it and found no sign of anything out of the ordianry. it still remains a mystery of could have made that noise but as of now me and my friend both say what we heard was bigfoot. all i have said is completely true. i hope this was worth reading if you have any questions or comments on this my email is [removed] ( i would actually like if you did respond to this so i can hear what you guys have to say about my story) thanks",back on windie roads if not fimiliar with the area it will be very dificult to find.,Monroe County,Indiana,Fall,"Report 28861: Loud, early morning vocalizations heard by duck hunters near Lake Monroe",39.02502,-86.49139,10/22/2009,28861,Class B,dnfqpb6chw,67.45,63.17,58.89,51.86,0.79,0.3,0.15,0.001,0.83,rain,1014.28,Rain overnight.,4,9.65,140,1.02
"I went fishing in Morgan Monroe State Forest with my two sons and our beagle. About mid day we heard something BIG in the woods near where we were fishing, way bigger than a deer running through the woods, in fact it was like a large crashing sound and about 30 seconds later there came the sound of a tree breaking. I suppose it's quite possible that an old rotten tree was in the process of falling down, and it didn't really scare us although it was odd. What happened for the next few hours was however beyond odd, it was downright spooky. For those who aren't familiar with Prather Lake, it's in a very remote part of Morgan Monroe and it's quite a hike to reach the lake when the access road is closed. When you get there you know that it is rarely visited, maybe due to the extremely rugged terrain or the long walk that it takes to get back there even when the road is open it's still quite a hike down a long downhill trail to reach the lake. Back to my experience, after hearing the noises coming from the woods nearby the lake my sons and I moved to another spot to fish. Not an easy feat when you're carting fishing gear and a stringer of fish because like I said, the terrain is rugged and steep. We moved to a place in about the middle of the lake and begin to fish again, this location was approximately the direct opposite side of the lake from where we heard the crash and tree breaking sounds. For the next few hours that we were fishing we heard sounds like someone banging on a tree with a tree branch. I guess in the world of Bigfoot research that's called knocking. The knocking seemed to be somewhat rhythmic in the sense that it was two or three big knocks followed by 10 or 15 minutes of silence. Our beagle was busy sniffing around all day long, like we'd never seen her sniff before, her level of excitement was through the roof! What was unusual about her behavior was that she was reluctant to leave our sight. She didn't venture out more than 20 or 30 yards from us until about the time we decided to leave. Anyone who owns a beagle knows that they love to sniff and love to stray away on the trail of what ever they are sniffing out and our dog is no exception. This day she didn't, and she seemed scared out of her wits. We were getting tired of fishing and were talking about leaving because we had about a hours walk ahead of us to get back to the car. We decided to finish out fishing because we only had about five night crawlers left and it seemed to be a waste to toss them. Our dog finally mustered the courage to venture out of our sight. She did so meandering up the mossy covered hill that we were at the bottom of and she was gone for about 15 minutes. We heard her rustling through the leaves and forest foliage and then she would get quite for a minute or two. I didn't think too much of it at the time until she let out a series of barks and whines that sounded more like she was in trouble than if she were on a trail. This got our attention and we looked in the direction of her calls, we heard her high-tailing it through the woods and she appeared racing down the hill in our direction. She raced toward me with her tail between her legs and nearly tripped me trying to hide behind me. We got a good laugh out of that figuring she probably got into it with some forest animal and it got the best of her. That's when we heard the knocking again- behind us in the same area that the dog had just returned from! We also noticed an extreme smell, like crap in the air. The dog began to bark and get super excited while looking up the hill behind us. She started to run up the hill again, but stopped short only about 10 feet from us and again raced back behind me and looking up the hill. Then we heard the knocking again. I decided it was time to go, my sons who are age 9 and 10 began to get spooked by all this excitement and honestly, so was I! All day long I had made up excuses for the weird noises we heard because I didn't want to say bigfoot or sasquatch around them and make them afraid to go into the forest. But things were beginning to get all too strange so we quickly packed up our gear, grabbed our fish (fought off the huge snapping turtle that was trying to steal the fish off of our stringer) and got the heck out of there.

"It's taken me a long time to share this story (about 7 years). My family, friends and I use to ride atv's very often, usually on the weekends. I had the biggest 4 wheeler so I usually stayed in the very back in case someone got into trouble or hung up, there was about 15 atv's. One night we were going through a classified forest called Kramers woods, which is an old growth forest with a tight winding trail and massive trees. As we went around a wet, muddy turn I seen the atv in front of mine, lights reflecting off the water hit something behind a tree that I was approaching. It looked hairy but I wasn't sure. Well, as I approached the tree while turning the atv left the thing (which was on my right) and I locked eyes. I'm 44 now so I would have been 37 at the time. I'm 6' tall 250lbs and rigid, I'm an old country boy and fear no man and could match or best most in strength, but this thing was no man, it was massive and was barely hiding behind this massive tree. It was tight against the tree with both hands flat on it and its chest tight against its hands. what happens next is very strange to me, but I know they are more than just an animal now, when he and I looked at each other we both knew he goofed and got caught in among that chain of atv's, I was instantly terrified but then instantly knew he was as scared as I was and wanted this situation to end. It was like we were in each others head and came to an agreement to just go on. My wife was riding with me so I never reacted because she would have screamed bloody murder if she would have seen it, it was 3 feet from us... I knew it was a male, just knew. He was at least 8 1/2' tall, I was the same height on my 4 wheeler as I was standing, and I looked way up at it. It's funny how small you feel, this thing could have easily have grabbed me, my wife or entire atv and threw us, that's how powerful it looked. I cant put to words how powerful it looked. I have gone online several times to try and see what i saw. Seen the white one on youtube but this one looked more human, people report red triangulated eyes, smelly & long matted coat, this one was none of that. Its coat was brownish orange with 2-3"" straight hair. I could see greyish skin and muscle mass. there is no body builder on the planet with the size muscle mass this thing had. Not much of a neck but its head was huge, its eyes were 2-3 times bigger, but just like ours with whites and pupil. The whites of his eyes I'll never forget because his eyes were what I was stuck on the most, the rest of him was at a glance.  His mouth was very wide (4-5"") with its lips pulled tight from fear (just like us). As I pulled away he took one step and vanished. I was amazed at how he was just gone, that quick.",,Spencer County,Indiana,Fall,Report 49467: ATV rider has close encounter at night near Patronville (with an artist's sketch),37.83837,-87.13843,9/20/2008,49467,Class A,dndp3078rr,81.89,73.09,64.29,59.36,0.69,0.22,0.69,0,0,,1021.53,Mostly cloudy in the afternoon.,7,9.47,203,0.62
"Ok... not ""just a story""... this happened to us recently here ""at home"" one night... Friday night, Oct. 10th, 2003 - Saturday morning, aprox. 1:00am.......  My son and two of his friends were coming home late one night, just about 1:00am on a Saturday morning after recent home-coming activities. Since their plans had gotten changed, I wasn't expecting them home; they were supposed to stay somewhere else. When they pulled into the drive/yard, I was already in bed halfway sleeping, when I awoke to the sound of someone pounding on the front door and yelling excitedly. Then I heard my name and ""dad"" coming from them. So, I slowly pulled myself from bed and made my way to the front room where I heard the sound of one of the bedroom windows sliding open. My son came falling thru and ran to the front door just about the same time I reached it so we opened it and let his other two friends in. They came in very quickly. In a jumbled mess of excitement, they started telling me about ""it"" being ""down there and coming up here"" and all sorts of things I was too groggy to understand. Saturday after work, I finally sat down with two of them to hear it all again and get the whole story, in order, and without all the confusion there had been the night before. Here's how they explained it....  After  pulling into the yard up near the trailer, they walked in the dark up to the porch and started to knock. Friday night, the 10th of October was right around a full moon, and the sky was absolutely clear that night. As they walked up on the porch to knock, one of the three looked back over his shoulder 'coz he heard something and noticed a ""stump"" down in the yard, about 150' away, near the boats at the edge of the water. The other two looked then to see what he was talking about, when ""the stump"" got up and just stood there. Even in the moonlight, they could see it was NOT a deer... not an ""anything"" except the form of a person, 'coz it stood there directly facing them and they could see it easily. So as they started to knock more excitedly, it began to walk away quickly to the east on the shore line, but then abruptly turned around and began to move much quicker right back across the yard where it had been and toward the marshy area and light woods and tall grass immediately south of the porch and trailer. When my son saw this he came running around the trailer and let himself in through the window. Now the other two could hear the sound of ""this guy?"" running heavily into the tall grass, sticks, branches and all the stuff that was down in the woods between the trailer and the lake, but then heard it starting to move closer in up the hill. That's when the hard pounding and yelling to let them in really started. We let the other two in, locked the door... I went back to bed, while they stayed up half the night rehashing what had taken place and how it freaked them out.  4 hours later, I was up... ready for work and out the door around 5:25am. I had my son get up and briefly talk me thru what they had seen earlier. Even at 5:30am as I was leaving, the moon had made it mostly west in the early morning sky and was still so bright I could easily make out every tree, patch of grass, boat at the shoreline... every little thing we're used to seeing out here. Back at 1:00am when this happened, it was even much more illuminated with the moon directly overhead, especially with the light bouncing off the water as well.  So, maybe it was ""just some guy"" out squatting and then standing in 5 inches of lake water at 1:AM in the middle of the country?  Well, when I'm 6 foot and about 200 pounds, and they see some ""guy"" who's way taller than me and a lot larger... and built a LOT larger... way taller... way larger... and grunting slightly as he ran...??   We only have one neighbor, and knowing them, they don't run around in a yard of standing lake water at one in the morning... or Noon for that matter.  He's also not approximately in the range of 8 feet tall, and built large at that height. Then my son reminds me when I asked what it looked like, he says, [ you know, like that thing xxxx and I saw about a year ago up between the sheds one night. >]  You see, somewhere about a year ago, he and a friend were out running around with flashlights and a paintball gun after dark, when they see what they thought was a stray dog laying in some tall grass between two of our outdoor sheds. They decide to shine the light on it and then shoot a couple paintballs at it when ""it"" starts to get up revealing that it isn't a dog, just some LARGE hairy...??? bigger than a man... but ""we don't know what it was... so we just ran"" kind of thing. They never saw a ""face"", but did see a large eye that reflected orangish red back at them when the flashlight hit it as it seemed to turn it's head slightly toward them. When they DID see the eye reflecting back and realized that was a head, they observed there was no muzzle of any sort. That's when they realized it wasn't a dog.  They didn't stick around for ""it"" to get up all the way off the ground. They could see that as it was getting up, it was large, hairy, more like a person and not a dog. So he really felt like this Oct. sighting was the same thing they had seen some 6 or more months ago.  So... that's basicly it. After much grilling on my part, I do believe them. I didn't see it myself. I wish I had the presence of mind that morning to grab a gun and stand on the porch and see if something did make it's way up the hill in the little woods. Why I didn't, I'm not sure. Too late to speculate.. only thing to do now is plan for ""the next time"".",This is a private residence on a small lake about 1+ miles north of town.

"A friend of mine cornered me late one day and told me a strange tale. He was going to shoot a rifle that he owns and he said he smelled something dead or rotten. He thought maybe someone had killed a deer or another critter. As he proceeded to walk through the woods, he said he saw a huge animal hunkered staring at him.  He said the shoulders were massive. His rifle was loaded, but he felt he didn't have a big enough gun (.223 cal.) They stared at each other for a few seconds, but my friend turned to the right and proceeded forward to get away from the ""MONSTER"" (his word). He said it bolted in the same direction as he did and ran past him in a second and a half. I said was it a bear?  He said no. Was it on two legs or four? He said two. It broke tree branches as it ran thru the trees and brush. He was so scared that he did not return to the woods for 8 or 9 months, and when he did, it was with a loaded 12 gauge shotgun loaded with deer slugs. The first person he told was his wife and she laughed at him. I listened to his story and did not laugh at him because he was so serious. I will say this, he didn't know about the bigfoot sites or even mention the name bigfoot during the telling of this tale. One other thing, he was carrying a bag of apples, he felt later that the MONSTER was after that. That part of the story I know is true. I saw the bag! I read your reports, and can tell you I don't know whether to believe them or not. I think my friend saw something strange and was scared. He warned me not to go into those woods any more. I said bigfoot didn't eat you so he won't eat me. He said he wanted to post a sign next to the woods that said ""MONSTER IN THE WOODS"", but I said no because I didn't need every guy in Indy with a 300 magnun chasing a myth or legend.

"I am a 40 year old engineer and have been passively interested in Bigfoot since I was a kid.  I never gave it much serious thought until two or three years ago a strange animal was sighted near Bloomfield, IN were my Sister lives.  This event re-ignited my interest and I began doing a little research on the subject and ran across your website. Since then a co-worker John (not his real name) told me about an experience he and his wife and son had last summer on a 600 acre farm along Blue River in southern Indiana near Fredericksburg. The farm belongs to the C.E.O. of our company. He uses it for recreation only.  There is a house on the property but no one lives there. Over the past few years he has some problems with the folks who used to own the property and one of the neighbors stealing things and tearing stuff up. My friend/co-worker is not at all interested in cryptozology or Bigfoot and would not take the time to write this report, therefore, with his permission I am submitting this report to you on his behalf. By June, we were all stressed out trying to finish our project on time. John (my co-worker) said he took his wife and 12 year old son out on 4 wheelers, to the boss's farm for some fishing and stress relief.  I ask him how the fishing was and he said ""We didn't catch a thing, but I think that crazy drug fiend was back their messing with us""! ""What do you mean"", I ask. ""We were fishing in the river and right after it got dark somebody kept throwing BIG rocks or something in the water where we were fishing trying to scare us off. I think it was that nut that used to live on the property or the crazy neighbor"" he continued, ""I just couldn't get a look at him"".  He was adamant about how big of a splash it was making and went on and on. I was intrigued and said, ""Tell me the whole story from the beginning"". This is how he related the facts to me about what happened to him, his wife and son. They drove the truck to the back of the property, unloaded the 4 wheelers and drove down the hill into the dry stream bed and followed it to where it intersects with Blue River. They arrived about 8:00 p.m. They were set up in the mouth of the dry stream bed where it dumps into Blue River. They had a lit a Coleman lantern as it became dark about 8:50 p.m. It had been dark for almost an hour when they heard a huge splash in the water about 150-200 feet up stream (to their left). His son asked ""What was that?"" It was a big splash. He explained to his son that it was probably just a limb broke off and fell in the water.  They continued fishing, talking, and relaxing.  After a minuet or so there was another big splash in the water.  This time it was a little bit closer. He described the sound of what ever was hitting the water as large enough to make a huge splash and then rain water droplets for two or three seconds afterward. It was loud enough to be heard over a 100 feet away in a running stream of water. He said it sounded like something the size of a bowling ball, or a heavy log; say 8 inches in diameter and 20 inches long, or a similar large heavy object hitting the water with great downward force. So by now he's kind of wondering what's going on here? He can't see anything beyond the circle of light projected from the lantern so he goes to the 4-wheeler to retrieve an ultra high intensity portable search light. Just then splash! A third time still closer, he shines the light around and doesn't see anything. The brush around the creek bank is pretty dense. They are standing a dry feeder stream basin about eye level to the ground on the surrounding banks so it is extremely difficult to see very far.  His son is kind of scared now.  John starts talking out loud ""Alright, I guess I'm going to have to get my gun out now"", as he rattles around in the tackle box. Splash! Just then a fourth object hits the water yet closer to them, still upstream a little. Again all of these objects, though never seen, are appearently 10-20 lb. hitting the surface displacing a large spray of water. My friend is mad now. He's shining the light around, turning it off and on trying to pick up any movement, looking for any anything that will indicate who is doing this and where they are.  He shouts out loud, ""Come on out where I can see to shoot"".  All of this is a bluff of course, as he doesn' t really have a gun at all.  So then he turns the light off and listens. A minuet or two passes then Splash! This time he is ready with the light and sees the spray of water from the impact about 30-40 feet away. At this point his son is pretty scared and ready to leave. He keeps trying to determine where the objects are coming from.  He can not tell if whoever is throwing them is on the opposite bank or on his side further upstream to the left. He said he feels like they were coming from the opposite bank, but he never saw anything to confirm or deny this notion. The opposite bank is a steep hillside that goes up a hundred feet or more at an angle of about 80 degrees. Their side is relatively flat with an open meadow and tree line along the bank to their left and dense woods to the right. By now his son was very scared and they have decided to pack up and leave. As they gathered their gear, Splash! something hits the water again about 20 feet away! Finally just as everything was ready to go, Splash! something big hit the water so close the water spray hit the bank where they had been standing a few seconds earlier. John said this time he saw the column of water spray shoot up into the air about 20 feet. He indicated there did not seem to be a forward or directional component to the objects path. He said it looked like something had dropped straight down out of the sky into the river.  At that point they climbed on their 4-wheelers and rode back to the truck. The whole time he was telling me this story he became more agitated over who ever it was messing with them and spoiling their fun.  The thought of a creature doing this never crossed his mind.  Of course I was trying not to jump headlong to that conclusion, but I was very intrigued to say the least. John said he checked his watch and all seven objects had hit the water within 12 to 15 minuets at approximately 1.5 to 2 minuet intervals.  (F.Y.I.  Blue River is about 30 to 40 feet across at the point where they were fishing). I ask him, & ""Did you hear anything?"" ""No, nothing"" he replied ""I kept listening to try to get a fix on where they were but I could never hear them moving around"". ""How do you pick up something that big and hurl it into the water seven times without making some noise on the ground?"" I ask him. ""The lantern and the stream made some noise, we were talking off and on, I don't know.""  he replied. ""Did you smell anything""? I ask. ""No."" He replied. ""Did notice if the nature sounds had ceased?"" I asked. ""I didn't notice the nature sounds one way or another"". He stated. ""Did you have any foreboding or erie feelings?"" I probed. ""Not really, I was more aggravated than anything else.  I was obviously worried and concerned for my family' s safety and tried to maintain my composure throughout the whole ordeal, but when that last object hit the water so close, with such force, it really did scare me a little. I didn' t experience any creepy feelings until we were on our way back to the truck and loading the 4 wheelers.  At that point I did feel the hair on the back of my neck stand on end. It felt as is we were being watched, that if I turned around suddenly someone would be there looking at me"". John replied. ""Did you hear any unusual animal noises at all?"" I continued to inquire. His face changed a little and said, ""Yes, we did hear something, now that you mention it.  We did hear a strange scream once about 15 minuets after dark, way off in the distance, like a half mile away, upstream. Then again 20 to 30 minuets later, real loud, much closer maybe 200 yards upstream about 10 min. before all of the rock throwing business started"". He described the screams as high pitched and approximately 4 to 5 seconds in duration. He could not determine what they were. At that point I was very interested and determined to go out there the next day and have a look around. It rained heavy that night and the next several days and flooded that whole area.  I went out there about two weeks later to look for any sign and came up empty. I'm sure he and/or his wife would talk to you about their experience. I can put you in touch with them if you like. He just don't care enough about what happened it to report it.  I wanted to go ahead and document it just in case someone else might have seen or heard something.","South of Hwy 150, on Blue River a few miles west of Fredricksburg, IN off of S. Sheppard road.

"My wife and I were night fishing for catfish on a Wednesday night on the Salamonie Reservoir when our occurrence happened. We were in a boat, at a remote part of the reservoir not accessible by vehicle or foot.  The nearest road is over 1 mile away. There was no one else at the boat dock when we put in, and I saw no other boat or boat lights on as we motored to are fishing spot.  We were sitting there fishing for about 3 hours. It was roughly 3-4 a.m. and we were sitting roughly 30-40 feet from shore.  All of the sudden there was something thrown at us from shore, something very large and heavy.  The object thrown at us had to have weighed in the neighborhood of 30-60 lbs. by the splash it made in the water about 10 feet from the boat. I instantly grabbed the 5 million power spotlight and lit up the area on shore. There was nothing.  We sat there for about 5 minutes with the light on shore discussing what had just happened. We then decided no human couldn't have possibly been there being so remote, nor threw something that heavy that far.  The splash actually made waves enough in the water to move the boat. I then started the boat and made fast tracks for the boat ramp. I first thought it might have been just kids messing around, but, like I said, nothing moved near shore for 5 minutes. I had the whole shore line illuminated, and the object, probably a rock from shore, was very, very heavy by the splash.","If you cross over State Road 9 going south, look to the left, as you can see, that is the idle only part of the Salamonie Reservoir, it is not near any county roads, no campgrounds, no homes, nothing is back there but woods and water.",Huntington County,Indiana,Summer,Report 28797: Fishing couple describes possible rock throwing on reservoir 10 miles south of Huntington,40.74765,-85.57069,7/1/2002,28797,Class B,dp5pucck62,91.92,80.95,69.98,71.72,0.74,0.25,0.72,0,0,,1019.81,Humid throughout the day and partly cloudy starting in the afternoon.,8,7.85,259,7.42
"On Friday, April 2, 2004, at about 5:00 PM my wife was returning by herself from a trip to drop off our daughter at a friend`s house west of Waubee Lake in Milford, Indiana. She was travelling east on County road 1100 North.  She approached the intersection with County road 300 East, which leads into Oswego, and came to a stop at the stop sign.  She looked left, right and briefly ahead.  Before beginning her turn she noticed movement directly ahead on road 1100 N.  She saw crossing the road from left to right,(heading south) approximately 250 feet ahead, two large, black, hair covered figures, taller than an average man walking on two legs at a hurried pace. Her first reaction was to say out loud ""what the heck was that?"".  The way they were walking very close together and hurrying suggested that they were aware they were exposed in the open and wanted to get back to cover quickly.  By the time she saw them they were in the middle of the road but she saw them take 5 to 7 steps over several seconds.  They were stooped forward and looking down and swinging their long arms quickly.  After this they entered the woods.  She said they were close enough to have scared her if they had looked her way.  Also, they were close enough to see they were not just men in black clothing as there were no divisions where shirt, pants and a hat would be; only solid black from head to toe. My wife, who is a college educated professional, then made her turn onto 300E thinking she would then have something interesting to tell me immediately upon arriving home.  When she reached home however, something else unusual happened. Instead of telling me, she apparently blocked out or repressed the experience from her memory, as if in denial.  I have been a Bigfoot enthusiast for many years and have read of this happening before to people seeing a Bigfoot.  It is like your mind refuses to believe what the eyes are telling it because it is so new, different and without a reference point. About 2 days later we were talking and I said something that brought it all back to her suddenly.  She then told me the whole experience in detail, showing signs of alarm and even imitating the way they walked. Of course I wasn`t about to believe her without asking questions.  After all I was the Biology major in college, I'm the outdoorsman and I'm the bigfoot enthusiast - I'm the one who should have seen them! I asked all the typical questions that the BFRO interviewers asked and she answered them all correctly, even adding additional detail. I asked if they might possibly be some young high school guys in all black Gothic clothes, as some of them like to wear. The answer was ""they were absolutely not men in black clothes"".  The thought also occurred to me that she was messing with me - playing a joke to mislead me, so I asked. This was the last straw; she got hurt and angry with me for not trusting her after 27 years of marriage, and I got the silent treatment for 2 days and had to do a lot of apologizing.  I'll have to just agree with her - based on the evidence, she saw 2 Bigfoots crossing the road.  Wish I had seen them! Hopefully, by learning as much as I can about this creature I will be able to remain calm enough to stay and observe it, if I ever see one, instead of freak out and run as most do.

"The Wednesday before Thanksgiving (I think it was 2003) we were headed to Arkansas to my mother-in-law’s house. We left home after my husband got off work. We took I-35 South out of Wichita, which was quite backed up. The sun was just beginning to go down and everyone had on their headlights. It was also beginning to drizzle the further out of Wichita we got. We had passed all the little small farm plots and houses south of Wichita.  There are several farms to the west of the interstate along with roads cut off by the interstate and drainage ditches. Cars were slowing down due to the drizzle and traffic after we passed a tree line that ran east to west. South of that tree line a ditch runs along the interstate, possibly a creek drains into it. Along this ditch are some small trees and bushes. It seemed to be deeper with higher banks than the other ditches along this road. The trees and bushes stop for a while and then start in again as the ditch comes up to a closed road and curves to the west.  I saw what I thought was a large wet dog with very long dark hair, running in the ditch but kind of loping along. As we got closer I realized that it wasn’t a dog and that the ditch was a lot deeper than I thought. The animal was way bigger than a large dog.  It was bent over at the waist and had long hair which was hanging down off its back and arms/legs and was soaking wet. The head was large and the face was turned away from the traffic. As we pull along side of it, the animal stood upright on its back two feet, keeping its head turned away from us, and took two steps up the bank (right foot ,left foot) and then straddled a barbwire fence with his next step and then easily cleared the fence with his left foot and disappeared into the tree line going west.  I tried to watch him as he walked further into the tree line but due to the car moving, the drizzle and the sun setting, I could not see if he continued west or not. There was also a farm house and a barn further west along the north side of the road. The tree line ended well before you came to the farm so if he continued west to the farm he would have been very exposed.  However, there was also another tree line to the south of the barn that ran north and south that was pretty thick. I thought that maybe he was headed to that tree row as it was the best coverage. Judging by his clearing the fence in one stride he had to be at least 7 1/2 to 8 feet tall, very wide at the shoulders and you could make out a butt on him as the hair was all wet and stringy like.  I yelled at my husband, “Stop the car, stop the car!!! Did you see that!? Did you see that!?” His responded “I can’t look at anything except the traffic. You want us to have a wreck!?”  Needless to say when I told him what I saw he said he didn’t see anything except the cars passing us and the car in front of us.  I did wonder if anyone else saw the bigfoot as all the right lane cars were going pretty slow. Maybe they did and that was part of the traffic problem.",Not sure if it was in Sedgwick or Sumner County.

I never thought much about what I heard until I heard some of the sounds made by the finding bigfoot crew.  My buddy and I were going turkey hunting.  It was about 5:00 am and we were just crawling into our hunting blind.  We both heard this load scream.  It sounded just like some of the high pitched sounds made on finding bigfoot.  Neither one of us had ever heard anything like it before or after the incident.  It scared the heck out of the both of us.  We loaded our shotguns as quickly as we could. Another interesting thing about the incident is that there were no turkeys roosting in the trees.  Just a week earlier my buddy had went to scout this spot and there were several turkeys roosting in those same trees.  Something had scared the turkeys from that area.  That is pretty unusual for them to leave a roost this time of year. I have been an avid outdoorsman all my life.  I have heard lots of different critters in my experiences in the outdoors.

My brother-in-law and I were finishing up fishing the Blue River one night and were making the walk back to the car. Its probably a half mile walk or so on like a dry rocky edge of the river. Along the whole side of the edge where we were walking is lined with trees decently thick. Anyway we grabbed our gear and were walking when I heard what sounded like someone walking along with us but up in the tree area (like 50ft from us). So after i heard it I stopped and it stopped. I started and it did again to. So we kept walking but that's when I decided to start whistling at it and sure enough it whistled back. The whole ten minute walk it walked with us and would whistle back and forth with me.

"I never gave much thought to bigfoot, especially living in Kansas.  I heard stories when I was a kid.  I was out for a walk by myself on a nice spring day enjoying nature and getting some peace and quiet away from my children.  I like to walk down to the Ninnescah River, so I went to the closest bridge by our house.  I walk quietly so I can hear everything around me, I practice listening to everything and using all my senses when I walk.  I got to the edge of the bridge at the river and I stopped as I saw a figure squatting down at the edge of the river.  First I thought it was a homeless person or local, but then I noticed they were covered in hair, so then I wondered why someone would be dressed in a bigfoot costume at this remote area by the river, then I looked around to see if there was anyone else filming trying to pull a hoax or something- you never know what the teenagers will do these days.  There was no one, and that's when I started noticing other details that pointed to the reality of the situation.  The bigfoot was breaking open mussels or clams or whatever and then eating them, which made me think 'Who would eat that raw from this dirty river where there is trash laying around?'.  That's when it fully dawned on me that this was not a human.  It was covered in a brown hair/fur.  It was squatting with its back towards me the whole time, it never looked back at me, and I didn't move until I turned and left to go home to try to get my phone to take a picture (which it was dark by the time I got home and there was nothing there when I got back).  It just kept opening mussels and eating them, and it would hit them on the rocks to break them open.  It had long arms, and it squatted flat footed, which I thought would be a difficult position to hold, as I squat with my heels up off the ground.  It's hands were shaped more like human hands, but the color was darker and the texture was kind of like gorilla/ape hands.  I couldn't say for sure how tall it was, but it seemed younger, probably 6+ foot or 7 foot tall, but I'd have to have someone help me determine how big it really was.  When I came back I didn't want to get down in the area because there are snakes around here.  I couldn't believe what I had seen, and didn't tell anyone, even my family, because this is Kansas.  I did make them squat to see if they did it flat footed- ha!  I also take them to the river whenever we go for walks.  I tried to get my husband to go for walks with me, so maybe he would see one, too, but he won't go for walks with me.  After the show aired I told my family about what I saw, now he might go for a walk with me!  I didn't think about reporting this to your site until Finding Bigfoot came to the very river I saw one at, and it clicked that Matt was the head of the BFRO and you might want to hear about this incident.  I saw it and I still can't believe it, why would anyone else believe it?  We live a couple blocks from the river, so if any investigators want to come check it out, you are welcome to stay here or base out of here.

I thought it was probably an owl. Tuesday afternoon, the 26th, I took this picture near the edge of the smallest ponds near the parking lot.

"This is the story my son's best friend (Ben, not his real name., age 19) told me the day after the occurrence. My son and a friend were in the same car traveling south on I-35, in Sumner County, Kansas, returning home for the weekend from college in Kansas City, MO.  Their classmate, Ben, was traveling in front of them, alone, in his own car.  It was after dark and was in the Spring of 2003. The leading car (Ben's) had a flat tire & pulled over on the highway shoulder; my son's car passed it and attempted to pull over to the shoulder, but could not do so, as there was an overpass or bridge Kansas 166, so he drove to the south side and pulled over (the area was described as 4 miles from the N border of Oklahoma). Both of the two drivers had a long-distance walkie-talkie, upon which Ben contacted my son to confer about what they should do; as the moon was very bright & visibility was good, Ben decided to walk along the highway to my son's car (about 1/4 mi. south of his, on the S side of the overpass).  Not wanting to walk directly on the highway over the overpass, he began walking down the slope bordering a pasture, along a (cow?) fence, planning to walk up the other side back to I-35. As he approached the bottom of the slope he saw what he thought was a large pile of trash & continued to walk toward it.  When he was about 6 ft. from it, he noticed that it was moving, squatting down and digging around in the dirt.  He stopped walking, and the thoughts went flying through his mind.  He thought it was a female child in a (white)fur coat, squatting down to urinate (this was not logical to him, as it was warm outside & a child would not be alone in this area); then he thought it must be a farm dog & began to get frightened.  Only a second or two passed when the thing glanced at Ben and began to stand up, groping very slowly for the barbed wire fence beside it.  Ben stood frozen, realizing that this was neither a child nor a dog, as the thing began slowly shuffling sideways away from him along the fence line (on two feet) & holding on to the fence. Ben described it as about 3 to 3 1/2 feet tall, covered with white or light gray hair, with a darker (gray), triangular patch of fur on its chest.  Its face was shaped like a human's, although covered with hair, and its nose was not large (like a dogs's would be); he could not see visible ears.  It's arms were too long for it to be a human and it's gait was more like a human's than a primate (which would walk with knees bent & legs open), although he only observed it walking sideways. (I have hand-drawn pictures Ben created the day after the occurrence). Ben then began backing away from it and turned & ran (all the while he was talking to my son on the walkie-talkie) back the way  he had come to his car.  He glanced over his shoulder once or twice; saw the 'thing' on the first glance & at second glance, it was gone, under the overpass, he assumed. My son said he could hear Ben yelling & cussing but only between steps, as the walkie-talkie apparently lost reception each time Bs foot came down.  Ben was yelling ""YETI, YETI!  A yeti is going to kill me!""  When Ben got back to his car he locked himself inside & told my son over the walkie-talkie what had just happened.  Ben also phoned AAA for help with his flat tire. My son drove to the very next exit, and crossed to the E side of I-35, where there was a convenience store & a auto repair or auto tow-truck station ajacent to one another (where the flat tire was eventually fixed).  A day or two later, I told this story to a personal friend of mine who immeidately got goose-bumps & told me that a friend of hers had, not two weeks before, told her a similar story, with a 'thing' fitting the same description.","I-35, Under an overpass wherein the very next (southbound exit) has a convenience store and tow-truck station (east side of I-35)",Sumner County,Kansas,Spring,Report 7709: Close roadside encounter of juvenile biped animal near South Haven,37.0581,-97.3374,1/27/2005,7709,Class A,9ydfc41p44,39.61,36.88,34.15,27.57,0.74,0.55,0.57,0,0,,1027.14,Mostly cloudy throughout the day.,3,9.58,79,5.35

"My husband and I rented a cabin in Nashville. We just came down for a year to Indiana. About 11 PM we went to bed. Within minutes our dogs went nuts. My husband got up to check and opened the front door of the cabin. It is covered by a porch and it was raining hard. The porch light doesn't work so it was dark. He closed the door and told me to bring a flashlight and firearm. I ran out of bed and went to him by the door. He said something was breathing heavy on the porch to the left of the door. At this point it occurred to me that our dogs were strangely silent. Being Akita's that have seen bear, wolf, coyote, and lynx all up close in Alaska this was not normal. My husband slowly opened the door again I sure enough something was breathing very heavy just to the side of the door. It also smelled. It was really strong, musky mixed with soggy old carpet and wet dog We closed the door again while we chambered a round and I lit the flashlight and we did a tactical to the left where we had heard the sound. It was gone but wet foot prints that looked like they were made with soggy fuzzy bedroom slippers were across the floor. It had come across our front lawn and up the right side of the porch and across the door to the other side where we heard it. The prints were close together while passing the first window and the door and when it fled it did it in one step. The foot prints were alot larger then my foot in slippers which is a women's 9.5 wide. I wondered if it realized what chambering a round meant since we had opened the door twice and it stayed breathing heavy right on the other side right to the side where we couldn't see it. Dogs didn't scare it and us two talking didn't scare it. That would indicate it had had human interaction maybe with hunters before. Not uncommon with bears in Alaska. A lot of people will chamber a round not wanting to hurt it but ready to if it gets aggressive. They are smart and learn fast what that sound is. Another strange thing is that the dogs paced all night. They did not do this after confronting an 800 lb brown bear in Alaska..literally. They worked together and chased all of the above away from around the home. We lived in a cabin off the grid.

This is the most important building on base. It is what we called the Comand Staff War School. It was guarded 24/7 everyone in had to sign in and out. NO EXCEPTIONS this was a very serious detail. Personally I hated it. I found myself on duty at the CAC with another MP we called JJ he told me about how an MP Officer had seen some big hairy thing along the river banks just a few days earlier, The officer was scared spitless according to JJ's story. He went on to say that this thing had been seen several times over the last few years and it's got everybody pretty spooked. The Officer in Question made a formal report about his experiance.

"I teach botany/ecology at a local college.  My wife and I were out hiking on the skyline trail (hike/bike trail) to see if any early wildflowers were out yet.  We decided to take the Mad Mile extension, since it runs parallel to the lake and is visually quite nice (as well as exhausting).  I was taking photos of mosses, so I was paying attention to the ground quite a bit.  My wife walked ahead a bit, and I was kneeling down to take some more moss photos when I saw this print (attached Word document).  I was very excited, as I had just started reading again about bigfoot, so I took a couple of photos (attached to the document).  The first photo is just a overhead pic, the second photo has my size 12 shoe lined up at the base to show how long the footprint was.  This was the only footprint noted, with good reason--the leaf litter on the trails was extensive.  I did see raccoon tracks, and my wife saw a turkey trot away; later we saw a cottontail scurry off.  This may be nothing, but as there was a sighting of BF some 20 miles away at the Baker Wetlands, I thought this might be interesting.","Perry State Park.

"I was taking pictures for my Photography class at Haskell University near the Wetlands.  I had walked over a pile of dead and chopped wood into the woods about fifty feet when I heard something ahead.  I looked up and saw something standing there, then immediately take off, and without much of a start jump about 7 to ten feet in distance over a fallen tree which was about five feet high.  It disapeared into the bush, and did not make a sound in its retreat.  The first moment I thought it was a worker from the nearby factory wearing a big coat, then I quickly realized what it was.  It had a full body of dark blonde/light brown hair, about 6'6"" or taller, and had a slight slouch to itself.  It was also very fast, very illusive, and had seemed to disapear in a glimmer when it took off.  I could not hear it beyond the brush where it took off to, so I thought it was still close by.  So, as scared as I was but with a camera in my hand I had to follow, but when I got into the brush there was nothing.  I didn't hear anything nearby, no bushes moving, no twigs cracking, nothing.  Though I felt as if I was being watched, as if something was still there, close by.  I just took a deep breath and took off to my car and went home.

"It was about 2 months ago, I was coming home from taking my sister home after we got out of work, roughly 1:30 am. I was on the phone with my sister as we live just 5 miles apart, (in my mind) so I didn't have to drive alone. About 3/4 of the way home something came off the side of the road so fast I had no time to brake. I told my sister that I thought I had hit a person, she asked if it was a deer? I said no it was upright and well over 6 ft tall. she said go back and look... so I turned around and went back and there was nothing there..a few days later we went to the local cafe for breakfast and I was talking with a native lady and I had asked her what kind of creature was on the reservation, she turned pale white and asked ""who told you?"" At that point I was covered in goose bumps and asked who told you? she said did you see it? I said yes and not only that I had hit it.. she was about in tears as she told me stories of elders being chased and another being chased after shooting at it in a tree, then she told me of her brother-in-law seeing it and was so scared he will not return to the reservation. I have asked around since then to other members and its always the same thing, the native people are afraid of it, they say it comes to you when it wants to tell you something and only the chosen ones will see it. I am not sure what I seen that night but it was very large, my husband is over 6 ft and 350lbs, and it was definitely larger than him, but the classic stories of being super hairy does not match what I seen. The creature I seen was tall and hairy but not long hair as I had always assumed it was, color was more brown than black, I never seen its face so I am not sure of facial looks, but large head, very long arms,and very fast.. I hit it with my car and it broke my bumper but didn't seem to slow it at all. I am not wanting fame or any TV time. I really don't want my name mentioned, we do live in a small community.

"November 20, 2011 Was deer hunting on the farm behind my house like ever year before. That season I used my hunting blind that I had setup a few days before. It had been raining that morning so I used the 4 wheeler to get back to the blind. I parked it beside the blind and took my stuff in. I poured a cup of coffee and opened a bag of donuts and loaded the gun. I could hear something step over the fence (normal sized person could not do that) this fence is double wide with extra electric wire. Then the foot steps continued to come closer to the blind. The foot steps sounded really heavy. The foot steps came to the side of the blind and stopped. I could hear heavy breathing and then it leaned over the blind . I could see a impression of a nose pushing down on the top of the center of the blind. The blind I have is 6 feet tall, this means he had to be at least 8 feet plus tall. The nose imprint began sniffing and leaning more on the top of the blind. This point I was getting really nervous, so I took the safety off on the gun and said (""if you are a person you better leave, if your a bigfoot then you better not growl or howl our push any harder on the blind cause I'm gonna start blowing holes in something"". Then the sniffing stopped while I said my little speech, but then started again more aggressively. I told myself to stay calm ,and then the subject stood upward and walked around the blind and then over to the woods. I tried looking out the window but could not see anything.. Scared the holy-**it out of me ..","Jacksonville,outside of Bagdad, KY in north Shelby county",Shelby County,Kentucky,Fall,Report 36230: Hunter gets investigated while in his blind outside Bagdad,38.24361,-85.03827,11/20/2011,36230,Class B,dng98fj10t,58.52,55.83,53.14,55.06,0.9,0.98,0.83,0.0223,1,rain,1020.76,Rain in the morning and afternoon.,2,7.25,209,5.63
"My name is Pam Lovins. I am a BFRO investigator in West Virginia. Earlier this summer I got a call from another BFRO investigator about a situation in eastern Kentucky, not too far away from my location.  I was the closest person so I was asked to look into it -- ongoing activity near Cave Run Lake. After multiple phone conversations with the reporting witnesses, I traveled to the site to see the location and meet the people. I arrived in the afternoon and met several family members. They were a local family who frequently camped near the lake in the summer. They told me about various Class B incidents at night, and at least one Class A sighting in headlights at close range. That last incident occurred only a few days before I arrived. I arrived in the afternoon and met several family members, most of whom had witnessed or heard something at some point during the previous few weeks. As dusk approached, two of the witnesses (two young men) hiked with me to a nearby hill where most of the activity seemed to emanate from.  We had with us a Sony nite-shot infra-red camcorder and at set of gen-3 nightvision goggles. These two witnesses, Chuck and Dusty, along with a few of their friends, had hiked up this same hill several weeks earlier. On that occasion Chuck was struck in the head by a rock. He was slightly injured from it -- had a minor cut in his scalp from the rock. None of these guys had returned to go back up there until this day. The three of us worked our way to the top of the ridge, stopping periodically to check multiple broken trees and branches.  It wasn't long before something was thrown against a rock formation as we were passing by.  We stopped and decided to split up briefly. Dusty went with me, carefully flanking one side of the rocky ridge. Chuck flanked the other side of the ridge. We eventually met up at the top of the ridge. At the very top we were standing on a huge rock formation with a big cavity in the middle. The cavity was a natural formation -- creating a shallow fortress-like arrangement on top. This shallow fortress afforded a nearly 360 degree view, while providing numerous quiet routes of escape along adjoining rock formations on the ridge. There were leaves and debris matted down inside the fortress, but there were no indications that humans used this particular spot anytime recently. We were videotaping this rock formation in the dark with the Sony nite-shot and talking as it got darker. I decided to let the two young guys use my night vision goggles and camcorder to have a look around.  At that point I only had a red headlamp with me. While they were looking through the gen-3 and continuing to record video, I stepped up higher on the rock formation to look down over the other side.  When I got up there and looked over the side, my red headlamp lit up a sasquatch standing 15-20 feet away. It standing motionless between two trees, just below the back of the rock formation. I could see it from the waist up, until I turned my headlamp briefly. Then it pulled back into the shadows and slowly walked away. For as many years as I've been reading about bigfoots and wondering what an encounter would be like, I would not have predicted my reaction when I finally saw one for the first time that night.  I was completely surprised and shocked.  It was no more than 15-20 feet from me, looking up at me from just below the rock formation. I think no matter how well you prepare yourself, you will be completely surprised and shocked when it finally happens. I was pretty addled at that moment. I started walking backwards away from the edge and nearly fell off the rock formation.  I turned off my headlamp and just stood there for a few seconds. At that point Chuck calmly said ""Eyeballs"".  I stepped over toward him and asked him where and he said, ""Over your right shoulder."" At that point I knew there were two animals up there because the eyeshine [glowing eyes] that he was videotaping were in the opposite direction of the one I illuminated only seconds before. I said out loud that there were two up there, but I didn't tell these young men that I saw one behind us, even closer than the eyeballs in front of us. I didn't want them to panic because that particular section of the rocky ridge is treacherous. It becomes more treacherous as the fog and dew moisture settle onto the rocks and make them very slippery. Chuck [one of the witnesses] continued videotaping the eyes and reacting to what he was seeing through the camera. One thing that I feel is particularly important to mention at this point.  When I tried to see the eyes I could NOT see them with my own the naked eyes.  But the eyes were not always visible to Chuck, so I may have looked at the wrong moment. A lot of my attention was in the other direction, where I saw one at closer range a moment before. My mind was racing because I knew one of them was behind us. When I looked in front of us I didn't see the eyes he was talking about, so I was trying to deny it in my mind. We stood there for a period of time, until I finally decided it was time for us to leave. We began heading back down the spine of the ridge the same general direction we had come up. As we walked in the dark I could clearly hear something else walking, following us down the hill. Then I heard other foot falls paralleling us to our left. The three of us were definitely spooked and felt threatened. Dusty had a large spotlight in his backpack and he pulled it out at this point. He lit up our way down the hill. We didn't see or hear anything else as we returned to camp. When we returned to camp we reviewed the video tape and I was happy to see that we recorded the eyeshine. The facial appearance of the one I saw with my headlight, in no way resembled what I had always imagined.  The eyes reflected the red headlamp. That looked eerie, but the rest of the face was surprisingly gentle looking -- gentle yet intelligent.  It looked surprised but yet unafraid.  The feeling I got was that it was curious but confused, confused as to what we were, and what we were doing up there after dark. There was no pronounced point to its head. It was more of a soft dome shape like a human.  The brow ridge was definitely heavier than a human.  The nose was the most surprising feature of all; it just sort of hung there.  No big flared nostrils or pronounced bridge, just sort of a bulbous lobe.  The mouth was wide, the lips rather humanlike, without the prognathism seen in other primates.",[Daniel Boone National Forest; not far from Cave Run Lake],Rowan County,Kentucky,Spring,Report 24674: BFRO Investigator videotapes encounter in Daniel Boone National Forest,38.05703,-83.46259,6/14/2008,24674,Class A,dnu8sb06k8,79.6,72.71,65.82,66.98,0.84,,0.38,0.0125,1,rain,,Clear throughout the day.,0,,227,1.36

"We have three episodes at the same location. Four years ago in mid September 2007, we decided to camp on our property which is located in Doe Valley Community.  The community is very special...it is nestled against Fort Knox Reservation and large forested areas.  Doe Valley is a nature reserve where deer, turkey, foxes and numerous other indigenous animals are so tame they will come up to be hand fed.  There is a no hunting restriction on the area which is riddled with caves and creeks.  In fact, the creek which backs up to our property was named by Squire Boone and hunted by the Boone family.  Several abandoned mills here were even built by Abraham Lincoln's father...so the area is very steeped in natural and American history. As we began camping this evening, we noticed that several rocks were rolling on the ground at different points in our night.  I was concerned someone was in the woods throwing stones, but our community is very rural and this would have been something very rare. We had also been hearing what appeared to be a loud howling...a mix between a female screaming and a wolf howl.  Not a fox yelp as we are used to hearing those...but much deeper and louder. The hour grew late, and my children got sleepy...so they decided to retire into the tent.  My one son insisted on using his own dome camping tent and though I am unsure why I was so leary...being in such a safe location.  But, I told him that if he wanted to sleep in his own tent he would have to place it in direct view of our family tent's window so I could keep an eye on him. I went into my own tent after puting the fire out and lay down just to keep warm while I waited for dawn...the time was about 3 a.m. Then suddenly a sound came from outside of the tent in the woods...a sound of cracking and very heavy footsteps through grass. It went WHOOOSH thump WHOOOSH thump WHOOOOSH THUMP and I began to chuckle thinking...here the children waited up to see deer, or raccoons...and they come when we go to bed.  But then the thing walks up to my tent and begans to walk past.  But then I realize...wait...this is walking on only TWO FEET.  I begin to smell the odor of a wet dog mixed with a skunk...or like an elephant pen at the zoo.  Suddenly it BUMPS my tent over and over again as it makes its way past my tent in a direct approach to my son's tent and suddenly my son's ENTIRE f***ing tent came off the ground and is shaken in the air like it was nothing.  It was just shaking it up and down and Cody is screaming NO STOP>>>TURK!!! That is my older son who was 15 at the time.  He was sick and went in to bed because he has a condition which causes muscles to contract when he uses them.  Knowing this thing could not possibly be my son...as the tent is several feet off the ground and something VERY large I know is there because I heard it approach out of these acres of wooods I shout ""CODY IT'S NOT TURK!!!MY GOD!!"" and the thing immeditately throws the tent down and begins to run extremely fast back against my tent which again begins to BUMP BUMP BUMP!  against the side...and then I hear it going back into the woods with the same WHOOSH Thump sound and then the sounds of cracking branches. My son immediately ran to my tent, where we called my husband who was on his way home from his night shift job. Flash forward to this year, mid September 2011...and my son and daughter were outside of our home...and a stench began overcoming them in our two car garage which had both doors fully opened up.  My son came out to find out what was making this horrible odor.  There, in the middle of our yard, not ten feet from where the tent had been four years ago..was an enormous creature, dark fur and hug eyes lit by our porch. My other son comes to me and tells me that this is exactly the same discription of the creature he and his friend came across at our creek.  It was bent over at the edge of the creek and when they came closer...it jumped up on two feet and walked quickly into the woods. .... Now, about fifty years ago...my mother and her mother wound up in the newspaper in Madisonville Ky for a monster which nearly took the door to their rural home off one night.  She saw the monster howling and grunting at the window.  It left marks upon the tree outside their home and the sheriff made a report.  I refused to let my mother tell this story to my children...despite her swearing that it was not a bear.  I am the sort of person who likes to see things before I will believe it...and I thought it a foolish story. But, I am here to tell you...something is migrating through Doe Valley each year...and it is not something I have ever seen in the animal world before.  The natural gentle and plentiful climate here with caves and plenty of unexplored forests...I feel is its perfect home. Now, I am a believer.",,Meade County,Kentucky,Summer,Report 30673: Family endures confrontation while camping in front yard near Fort Knox,37.96027,-86.11702,9/15/2007,30673,Class A,dndzbq7qxg,69.18,59.76,50.34,40.56,0.5,0.02,0.13,0,0,,1023.54,Clear throughout the day.,7,10,7,2.8

"In the evening, my boyfriend and I along with a friend were camping out in Red River Gorge in Kentucky. We got set up, and were sitting outside the tent while it got dark. There were no campfires allowed in the area we were in, so it got dark fairly quick. At around 7pm, a really loud howling sound began not too far away from where we were camped. It sounded like a primate, hooting and howling out in the mountain. It lasted about 10 or 15 seconds, and then stopped. After about midnight, when we were in our tents and trying to go to sleep, twigs and branches were snapping around our tent. Things were being moved, thrown around. My boyfriend got up and loaded his rifle, and lay back down. Whatever it was went away for a little bit. At around 3 in the morning, another ear-piercing scream not ten feet away from our campsite echoed off the trees. We stayed awake after that, and something pulled the tent stake out of the ground on our friends tent a little while later. We got out and looked around, but couldnt see much because it stayed in the treeline. It felt like there were more than one, because it kept hitting sticks against the trees and breaking branches.

So I did a howl and got no response i stood on my porch for about 10 minutes and figured if there was a bigfoot in the area it probably moved on by then. I was just about to go back in the house when I noticed something moving behind a large pine tree that stands in our yard. I stood there for a moment because I thought the chickens might be roosting in the tree when I seen the sasquatch peek around the tree. I saw it and it saw me, our eyes met and he stepped out from behind the tree I ran inside but watched through the open door it kept watching me, then in 3 large steps was across the road and faded into the darkness. It had long brown hair. I measured where it stood after. and where its head was, using the pine tree for scale, I measured ten feet 2 inch tall there was one foot print in the yard I didn't have any casting supplies so I took a picture of it and measured the foot print at 17 inches.

"August 12-2012 2:30am I first heard a howl at 2:30 am less than 50 yards behind the house in the tree line. I walked out on too the porch with the spotlight and searched the tree line but could not see anything. Less than 5 minutes later I heard the howl again then immediately another howl less than 40 yards from me. I still could not see anything. Then the next howl was behind the garage and howled twice. I then eased back into the house and quietly closed the screen door. Suddenly there were small rocks hitting the porch roof, this lasted about 7-8 minutes. I went to the bedroom to wake my wife up to tell her what was happening. She of course didn't believe what I was telling her. Within 5-10 minutes she heard 2 howls to the left of the house about 75 yards from the house. No more then 10 minutes later we both heard 2 more howls across the road around 100 yards. Around 30 minutes later I heard one more howl back to the right of the house about 150 yards out. Quiet rest of the morning. I know what coyotes sound like, this was no coyote.

"This sighting occurred while doing a Paranormal Investigation at Octagon Hall in Franklin, Kentucky. Upon arrival, we talked to the curator of the property and he advised us that an investigator from the previous night had a possible Bigfoot sighting. He also produced a cell phone picture taken the next day of the fields about 3/4 of a mile away where the sighting took place. Around 2 a.m. a teammate and myself headed out to investigate the area in question. There is a large clump of hardwood trees and other foliage (about 3/4 mile long & 1/2 mile wide) in the middle of the otherwise barren field I vocalized a loud ""whoop"" a few times with no results. As time passed I decided to try the loudest, most guttural howl I could muster. I performed the call and heard two responses from a mile or so in the distance, but thought it could be the echo from the howl. A few minutes later my fellow investigator and I saw movement beside one of the trees about 30 - 40 yards away. We both stood still and saw a large silhouette of a humanoid figure peek out from behind a tree. It swayed left 3 times, paused; then sway 2-3 times to the right and stop.Since we weren't using our flashlights, our eyes were very attuned to the darkness.The figure was around 7 feet plus in height, the 1/2 of a large head, shoulder and arms that were past the knees.This activity continued foe a few minutes, to the point that I asked my fellow investigator if he was seeing what I was seeing. We actually took turns mimicking the movement as it happened. First me, then him. The timing and movement was exactly the same in real time as what we were viewing. We initially thought it could be a ""shadow figure"" of a large Civil War soldier, but the height, arm length and recent activity on the property prompted me to conclude that it was a flesh and blood Bigfoot sighting and not of a spiritual nature. When we tried to get closer to the figure it retreated for a final time     and was no longer there. We both went to the tree and there was nothing there that could explain the dark figure we both saw.","Octagon Hall 6040 Bowling Green Rd Franklin, Ky",Simpson County,Kentucky,Spring,Report 41776: Humanoid figure spotted at night near Octagon Hall during paranormal investigation,36.8066,-86.5549,3/20/2012,41776,Class B,dnd3qkktux,83.36,73.54,63.72,56.87,0.59,0.02,0.94,0,0,,1017.51,Clear throughout the day.,7,10,159,4.18

"My encounter took place while leaving the Lake Barkley Resort.  My family and I were driving back toward the main road that leads to Cadiz, KY.  I was going about 50 miles per hour when I saw a deer run across the road. I thought I saw a tree next to the road but it was running.  It was taller then the top of my mini van and looked right at me,  we passed it in about 3 seconds.  I was not really sure what I saw so I turned around to see if it might have been a tree or something but there was nothing there.  I remember afterwards that it was a large creature, with tanish/brown fur around 7 feet tall with an almost Neanderthal brow and flatish nose.  It was hard to tell what color the fur was exactly since my headlights are tinted yellow. My son who was in the back seat also saw it and commented on it. The animal was running upright along the edge of the road. it seemed to be chasing a deer that had run in front of our van literally seconds before. It kept pace with me for about 3 steps then dropped back. When I looked in the rear view mirror, it had run off.","From Cadiz, KY - follow 68 West heading towards Land Between the Lakes.

"I am sending you the information I have on two seperate sightings that occurred in the same area but on different days by my grandfather and my father. My grandpa drove a school bus and at about 5;30-6;00 one morning he said that what he thought was a big man with shaggy matted reddish brown hair came out of the woods and stepped up on the road in front of the bus and ran across the road. My grandpa said he thought it was a man until he seen how big it was then he thought it was an ape but it walked like a man only it was slouched over at the shoulders. Some of the old buildings around his house which was close to the sighting at the time had wierd looking hair stuck to the screens where we thought dogs had been going in or something. We never seen anything but we always heard a really scary sound that was like an ape and a chipanzee mixed with human and it would make a screaming howling noise up in the hollow behind there house. The men would all gather up to go out spotting to see if they could find out what it was but they never found anything. When my father seen this creature he was also driving the school bus at about the same time as above he said that there was a path that joined on both sides of the road he said it was a deer run. When he came around the curve there was a big thing that looked like a man and ape with matted patchy red/brown hair like it had been burned or something running down the path so he hit the brakes and the thing ran across the road and down the other path. He watched it til it was gone and then when he got back he was telling my grandpa about it and thats when my grandpa said he seen the same thing about half mile from where my dad seen it. My family still lives in this area of Ky but we haven't heard or seen anything like this. The year would have been the late 70s for I was little then and I am not sure about the month but I might be able to find out. This took place on Rock Run Road in Vanceburg , Ky 41179.  I would love to go looking for tracks and evidence but I am afraid of what I might find while I am by myself so as soon as I get enough family members willing to go tracking we are gonna look and see if there is anything there.

"I was working as a security guard at a strip mine location in the mountains of ky near Whitesburg.  One night after making my rounds I came back to the guard shack, did my report and was just relaxing listening to the rain........that's when I heard a loud crunching sound beside the shack. So I stood up and watched the shadow from under the sides of the shack.it was moving towards the door. A few seconds later it was trying to open the door by pulling on it. That's when I yelled what do you want........That was when I heard the most terrifying sound ever, like a screaming howl. And it then began to pull harder on the door. So I got a poker and put it in the coal stove that was our heat source for the shack..it got red glowing hot. I then told whaterver it was what i had and was going to do with it if it opened the door. After a few minutes it got quieter and I watched it's shadow move from under the door. After several minutes I made a decision to get to my car..I threw open the door of the guard shack so that the light from inside would show a little outside.and I made a run for my car,got in locked the doors started it up put it in drive and got on the C.B. radio to inform the other guards of what I had just encountered.I stayed the rest of the night in my car.The next morning when my relief showed up I informed him of what I had encountered and I looked for footprints.but the heavy rainy made it difficult to find any that would be useful.

"I was home alone one mid-October evening.  My husband and I have a cabin located in rural Lee County, KY.  It’s a primitive cabin, no electricity, no phone, hand pumped water, no neighbors, etc.  My husband was visiting friends about 8 miles away.  Just after dark, I was sitting inside, reading a book, when I heard what sounded like two logs being hit against one another...making a loud, hollow “knocking” noise.  The “knocking” happened 3 or 4 times in a row...then it paused...”knocked” again 3 or 4 times in a row...and this was repeated for about 15-20 minutes.   I looked outside but didn’t see a thing.  You can’t hardly see your hand in front of your face at our cabin, unless the moon is out...and it wasn’t.  Just a few minutes after the “knocking” stopped, someone or something threw what sounded like a handful of gravel onto the tin roof of the cabin.  We have oak trees around our property but the branches were mostly bare at that time and they don’t hang over the roof...so nothing could have fallen from them onto the roof. Needless to say, I was scared to the bone and didn’t/couldn’t make myself go outside.  My husband left one of his guns at home for protection and I sat on our bed, with the gun next to me facing the door until he got home. When he did get home...I told him what happened.  He went outside and shot his shotgun off into the woods about 10 times.  Later this same evening, he heard something rustling around outside so he went out the front door and shot his .45 off about 12 times into the woods behind the cabin where the noises came from. The next morning, he went outside to take a shower...(we have an outdoor shower behind the cabin)...and he found one of the bullets from the .45 sitting straight up, in the middle of the shower floor like someone just walked over and set it there.  The bullet wasn’t deformed in any way...it didn’t look like it had hit or gone through anything other than the rifling. My husband has always thought there was “something” out there...and has never doubted the existence of Bigfoot.  Since that experience, we have become very interested in the Bigfoot sightings, followings, documentaries, websites, etc. and would like to one day participate in the expeditions.","located in a saddle (a choke-point) of trails, between Fixer Valley and Little Sinking Valley, off of KY 1036",Lee County,Kentucky,Fall,Report 27323: Possible harrassment at a secluded cabin near Zachariah,37.65805,-83.79678,10/13/2009,27323,Class B,dnsqjpmn19,60.78,53.985,47.19,53.41,0.87,0.92,0.84,0.0001,0.26,rain,1022.6,Overcast throughout the day.,3,9.54,346,0.97

"It was about 9 or 10 feet tall, it was so big it covered the entire window.  The window was long and narrow and about 4 feet from the ground. I'm guessing the hair was about 3 inches long and the color looked like copper in the bright light. The pictures you have on this site looks just like the one I saw except the face. The face of the one I saw was covered with hair and the eyes were big and round. It had brown eyes.  The lips were not big and thick, they were thin compared to the pictures.  The nose I didn't notice maybe the hair covered it or I don't remember it anyway.  I mostly remember the eyes. It never showed it's teeth or made any kind of facial expression.  I didn't scream or do anything myself but look into it's eyes. I wasn't afraid of it, infact I have always thought that it didn't want to scare me away. I felt sorry for it, for some unknown reason I felt it was a female that had lost it's young. It had made it's home under my back lawn.  There must have been a mine or cave on the other side of the hill that lead back under the lawn.  There were houses close beside my house and none of the nieghbors saw it.

In 2005 while fourwheeling with my girlfriend in some bottomland near where I live I was following the laurel river as it snakes its way through these dense bottoms. it was getting dusk dark and we where on the left side of the river as we were riding we had met about 6 deer that were on our side of the river and we sat and watched them with out turning off the fourwheeler. I was carring my sony hi8 camcorder because i have seen bigfoot before but it had been awhile. i also had my .44 magnum pistol on me for we have lots of wildlife around hear and i would rather be safe than sorry. well as we continued our ride we came to a bend in the creek and the tree frogs and crickets were so loud that they about drowned out the atvs engine roar. so i turned it off so we could hear them better because the sound was just really nice and soothing. as we sat and listened i caught a movement out of the corner of my right eye across the river. now first i must tell you that the woods across the river had been logged about 2 years prior so it had a second growth of timber and the animal that i saw was about 75 yards away. anyway i saw a movement out of my right eye so i turned to see an animal which looked like a gorilla for it was on its all fours but was the color of an orangutan for an orangish/red and when it turned its head to look at me its face which i saw pretty well was white much like that of a skull. my girlfriend was looking the other way when i jumped off the atv to film this creature. the creature moved quickly to the base of a downed tree top which it was in front of and just climbed right over onto the otherside where i lost sight of it. my camera was around my neck so i poped off my lens cap cover and started filming in which all i got was a short video of the main branch of the tree shaking where it had just went over. this all took place in just a few seconds possibly 12-15 seconds. i was very disappointed as im sure anyone who looks for these creatures would be. i have alot of other reaports from around hear that i will post as soon as i can and i also have gamecameras in the woods at all times hoping that maybe one day he will run by it. thanks for your time . wes i.,hwy 229 to 830 to 1189,Laurel County,Kentucky,Summer,Report 18174: Small gorilla-type animal seen at dusk along the Laurel River near London,37.0787,-83.95846,7/20/2005,18174,Class A,dns6cmzr44,89.76,81.02,72.28,70.47,0.77,0.28,0.47,0,0,,1019.02,Foggy in the morning.,9,7.29,209,1.87

"While looking through reports for Kentucky I came across report #11966 in Lawrence county, KY. I had a sighting/experience around the same time period and same area near Blaine, KY. I have never told anyone of this other than at the time it happened I told my wife I had been stalked out of the woods by something large and packed my family up, leaving the area. In 2003 my wife and I took our daughter and youngest son with our travel trailer to camp at Yatesville Lake State Park in Lawrence county,Ky near Blaine. We arrived on a Friday in August with intent of fishing and I always go on ginseng hunts where I am able/allowed. I think it be noted I am an avid outdoorsman having hunted, fished, hiked, and camped in at least 28 states of the USA for 40+ years. I am well acquainted with big game animals including bears, mountain lions, elk, deer, and wild hogs. I stake my reputation on my word and kept this encounter to myself. On Saturday morning I took my family to fish in the lake at a spot where Highway 32 bridge crosses a fork of Blaine Creek. After my family was set up, I took off into the mountain on the southwest side of this bridge and possibly part of Yatesville Lake WMA to hunt ginseng. As I had worked my way up a long deep hollow and neared the top of the ridge and to my left I heard knocking like someone striking a piece of wood against a tree (similar to what researchers hear/do). I also had several rocks come through the trees from the top of a small cliff at the top of the ridge, but thought they had fell off the rock formations on their own. Then as I happened to look back behind me from the hollow I came out of on the far side of that ridge I saw a very large dark hair covered figure that was watching me and it was standing upright, it definately was not a bear. I estimated later it was near 8' tall, I'm also a carpenter and pretty good at measurements. As silly as it sounds, when it left my sight, I spoke aloud to this ""thing"" and said ""Old one I mean no harm and I'm only taking what I need"" all the while easing my way around and down toward my family, once I was out of eyesight I took off down the mountain as fast as I could, I could hear this ""bigfoot"" following at a distance. Once I got to my family I told my wife to get everything to gather and packed my family out of the area telling them a bear was stalking me off the mountain.

"I was deer hunting, watching a clearing between two thickets. It was between 7:30 and 8:00 in the morning in November, the temperature was below freezing and there was a thin layer of snow on the ground. The thickets were cedar thickets. I was sitting on an old road, in the head of the hollow, about a hundred yards from the trail crossing the clearing. The clearing was about 50 or 60 yards across. I heard, from the top of the thicket to my left, crashing, brush and limbs breaking, very loudly, like large limbs. It lasted maybe ten seconds or so. About five minutes later, I heard the same noise, maybe fifty or seventy five feet down the hill in the direction of the clearing. Brush and limbs thrashing, breaking, hitting together. Then about five minutes later, the same noise closer down the hill. The last time, it happened about 20 yards into the thicket from the clearing. Then, out of the thicket stepped something, walking on two legs, black from head to toe, with it's arms swinging by it's sides it walked across the clearing in probably no more than five or six seconds. I was too scared to move, but I took my gun and eased out of there, too busy watching the clearing to really look for tracks, but the grass was so thick I couldn't have seen any anyway. When I got to the truck, I waited on my hunting partner, worried that something might have happened to him, I walked partway back into the area and met him coming out, he asked if I had seen a large pile of feces in the road through the clearing on my way out. I had walked down that road about 30 minutes earlier and it wasn't there then. He said it was in the area where I saw this thing cross. He described the feces as loose, with grass and long, black hairs in it. I then told him what I saw and he said he was sure it was a bear and my imagination added to it. He never did believe me and no one else has, either. But it's true, I am a minister and have no reason to lie.","About four miles from Blaine.

"I live in the very wooded hills of eastern kentucky. I noticed that some of my garbage behind my house had been ripped up, not reallly chewed up. Then one night about 2a.m. I let my dog out for the night and I saw him looking up the hollow(which is a very deep valley with a creek at bottom and about 4-5 caves surround the area). About 5 minutes later i heard him barking loudly like at something and i could tell, I went to the door and yelled for him to get back here thats when i heard him skuffle with something. I could not see him but, then suddenly he came running back fast and ran in the door. I then called my dad which lives right beside me and told him to bring his light and his gun something was outback trying fight the dogs. We started to walk up the hollow and heard really loud crashing and breaking of good size limbs, and also heard a grunting sound a couple time. They move for about 30 seconds very loudy breaking everything it sounded like, I heard alot of animal run in the woods but not any that just run right through the trees most animals will dodge the brush. We held the light up on the hill about 100 feet away for awhile all we heard was one constant sounds in the leaves right in front of us as something else walked around to the right of us. We left right after that because we didnt really hear anything anymore. The next day me and my dad decided that we was going to go look to see how the brush was broke or any kind of sign of what we were dealing with because we have had a big history of dogs just disappearing without a trace, and i have 3 dogs now so i want to protect them from whatever i thought it was. We walked all over the hill only finding spots where it seemed like something was bedding. As we were walking off we decided to walk down an old logging path off the hill, about half down my dad says whats that there and I look and see what looks like a really big human foot print, but like really big with a prominate heel and toes with a arch in the middle of the print. We both looked at it and looked at each other we both knew it looked like no animal track we had ever seen before and we are avid outdoorsmen. We came back down off the hill amazed by what we had found. So I got on the internet that night looking at some bigfoot stuff, i had watch some already and i believed in bigfoot but never really thought i would experience it in my own back yard. So I looked up some stuff and saw that some people had heard a banging stick sound. The next day which was April 15 2010, I went back to the footprint to take pictures, which i have and would love to share. I took the pictures and decided to start banging some sticks together to see if i could call something out. I did it for probably about 10 minutes and was about to stopped i was gonna do it 2 more times. I hit it again and right after i did I heard a loud really high pitch scream/roar that sounds just like the recording that was caught in Ohio in 1994. It scared me so bad I turned and ran a fast as i could down a really steep hill running through briars and everything, i thought i was running for my life. I made it all the way back to the house i had never been that scared in my life. Ive heard almost every animal before even a bobcat and I have no clue what made that sound. I didnt even take time to look back even though i wanted to try to attract it to snap a picture. I am definately a firm believer now and I think if someone could come investigate pretty quick it may still be hanging around. I am going to continue to try to lure it out and try to get a good clear picture( if i dont run again lol) I also have the pictures of the print that i would love to share.","West from louisa, in a area called fallsburg.",Lawrence County,Kentucky,Spring,Report 27589: Possible footprint and strange occurrences  at a rural residence west of Louisa,38.11509,-82.70393,4/13/2010,27589,Class B,dnv0y48u6z,78.36,63.78,49.2,39.53,0.49,0,0.97,0,0,,1025.44,Clear throughout the day.,9,7.7,29,2.02

"I saw something along Interstate 75 South in Kentucky, maybe 30-40 miles south of Cincinnati. I don't recall exactly where along that highway I was at the time, somewhere after three lanes had been reduced to two. And it happened 4-5 years ago, in 1999 or 2000. I don't recall what time of year it was, maybe autumn. It never occured to me to report it, and I just found this site so I thought I'd let you decide if it has any merit. It was late, between 1-2 AM, and I was heading back to Winchester, KY (20 miles E of Lexington on Interstate 64) after a visit to PA. No other traffic was on the road at the time I sighted what appeared to be a large animal standing in a recess along a road cut, which I wouldn't have seen but for my headlights; there were no street lights or other sources of light. It stood erect and was covered in dark fur like a bear, which I imagined it must be, but it had no muzzle like a bear. I wondered if it could have been an elk because it was the right height, but I couldn't reconcile an elk with the other body features. It was only in view for 3-4 seconds and was not moving, only looking directly at my car as I sped by. I passed within 15-20 feet of it. I looked directly at it, and it had an angry expression on its face. It made my hair stand on end. I usually didn't travel via Cincinatti when I lived in Winchester (I live in Lexington now), and in subsequent trips along that stretch of road I have been unable to find the exact spot at which I sighted it. Perhaps the roadway has since been modified to eliminate overhanging rocks; there has been a lot of road work along that stretch in the last few years. And I've wondered if it was just the play of shadows from my headlights that gave the illusion of something standing there, but the shape of a shadow changes as the light source moves, and this figure did not change. I was not sleepy; I work a night shift so I'm usually awake at that time. I'm reasonably certain I saw something, just not sure what. In summary, whatever I saw was 6-6.5 feet tall, dark brown to black fur, bipedal posture, angry demeanor. And it appeared to be holding its arms/paws up at shoulder height, as though it were a tree, or stiking some pose intended to frighten me, which was very effective. My initial impression was that it struck a very human posture. I heard no sound and it it not move.

"On Jan 14th, 2010,  I was taking my son to school on Hwy. 36, outside of Sanders. We were following a Ford Ranger and were probably 30-40 foot behind it. I noticed something run quickly in front of that truck. I did not see the thing run from the opposite side of the road, though obviously that’s where it came from. I noticed it when it was right in the middle of the road. I’m guessing that the truck is between 5’ and 6’ tall. From my view, behind the truck, I could still see about 1’ of the thing over the top of the cab before it came back into full view and went up into the woods that run right by the road. During the second or two that it came back into full view after crossing in front of the truck, I was able to see it’s silhouette fully in the headlights from the truck. It was on two legs, dark in color, wide (depth of the body, from back to chest-I don’t mean the broadness of the shoulders as I saw it from the side), large legs and very tall. Because of it’s position and it being dark out, I was not able to see the face or front of it.  I’m not able to give any description of  the fur or hair that was covering it either. I wish I could tell you that I saw a Bigfoot. Since I can’t say that for sure, I will tell you what I did NOT see, for sure. I did not see a deer, elk, bear or man. The truck in front of me hit his breaks during my sighting so there is no doubt to me that he saw it as well. I should tell you that this thing crossed closely in front of him. It wasn’t like it was a great distance in front of him. I wanted to run up and talk to the man in the truck when we got to the end of the road but didn’t because I didn’t want to scare my son (who is already afraid to play outside out house by himself). As soon as this vanished from my sight, my little boy gasped and yelled, “Did you see that?”.  I responded calmly telling him that I had and asked him what he thought it was. He was unsure but said that it was big and quick. I didn’t ask any more questions at that time as I didn’t want to scare him or lead him in any way. I wanted to see what he would say about it after the ‘shock’ (?) had wore off. I asked him again this morning (Jan. 21st) what he thought it was. He said that he didn’t know. I asked him what size he thought it was and he said medium sized.

"My family and I (my wife and two daughters, aged 10 and 15) were vacationing in Mammoth Cave State Park (Diamond Resort specifically) from June 27 - July 1, 2003.  We had a cabin situated on a golf course at the resort.  We were in the area that was furthest from the pool, clubhouse, tennis courts and all other facilities.  We were in a condominium and at the time were the only family staying there.  Just after sunset, while still dusk (Astronomical twilight would be the most accurate term), I heard a load scream.  At first, I dismissed it as a Coyote, but then I heard it again.  After this vocalization, I realized that every other sound had discontinued - no crickets, birds, dogs - nothing.  It was absolutely silent.  Being a curator for the BFRO since 1998, my interest was understandably piqued.  The third vocalization was absolutely unmistakeable - the nearest human counterpart would be that of a women being brutalized and screaming as a result.  I immediately contacted Matt Moneymaker by cell phone to see if we could hear it again, but that was the last time.  It was very difficult given the terrain to determine distance or even location.  After the incident, I personally yelled and heard echos from nearly every direction.  Other than my sighting at the age of 9, this is the only other experience that I have had.

"About a month ago around 9:30pm cst, I was going out to feed my dogs after working outside with the kids all day, when I heard 3 SOLID wood knocks.

It was the opening morning of Kentucky black powder deer hunt. I had found a saddle on a map that was almost 3 miles back into the hills. I went into the saddle 2 days before and found a big rock over looking the draw and the ridge that leads into the saddle. It was some where around 1 hour before day light that I was slipping up the ridge about 1/4 mile from the big rock. All at once something jumped up out of the tall grass on my left side. Then all at once another something jumped up. I turned my 2 AA flashlight on and turned it at what ever jumped up. 2 sets of red/ orange colored eyes was looking at me no more then 50 yards away. The biggest of the 2 looked to be around 7 ft to the eyes. The other was about 2 ft smaller. With my small light I could not see for sure what I was looking at. All I could see was 2 dark things looking at me. All at once they took off running and the eyes disappeared. I spotted the eyes again going out the ridgeline about 100 yards in front of me. I thought it was bears standing up looking at me in the grass so I didn't think much of it. I got to the rock and set up my gear for my hunt. I wear scent lock clothes when I deer hunt and I also drag a rag with deer pee on it behind me to mask my scent. I tied my orange vest up in a limb over my head so other hunters could see me. I put my ghillie suit on and set back waiting on daylight. Right at the break of daylight I was looking into the saddle for a buck.  All at once a stick about 2 foot long come flying at me and landed right behind me. I turned and looked and seen this big black brown monkey looking thing squatted down looking at me about 50 yards away. My first thought was somebody was teasing me or was trying to run me off. I stand up and yelled HEY YOU BETTER SAY SOMETHING OR I WILL SHOOT ..... I pointed my black powder and it moved its arm back and I could see it had another stick in its hands. I yelled again... All at once it come rushing at me. I shot in front of it and it turned and took off. It went about 75 yards and stopped. It stood up and looked over toward a thicket and grunted. A smaller one come running out making a crying sound. By this time I had already reloaded and was headed off the rock away from the things. I walked out away from the rock and left all my gear. The next day I went back in to get my gear. When I got there my backpack was tore open and my things were laying everywhere. I had crackers and potted meat and some coke colas. The cans had been hit on the rock and busted open. Anything that was food was ate. I had a knife and a game boy in my pack also. They were still there ....... that proves to me it was not somebody...they would have took them. The limb my vest was on was broken out. My drag rag was gone. I think I seen a mom and a baby bigfoot.

"In October 2008 we went on a 4 wheeler trip to Harlan county,  in eastern Kentucky near the Big Black Mountain area, we do this several times each year. My friend,  (Ricky)  also brought along 2 of his friends who were visiting him from Florida. Let me add here that these 2 men are also great hunters, and trackers as is ""Ricky"" which is how they became friends in the first place....   Now on to the story...............  On the 2nd morning of our ride we were off the regular riding trails, and into some very thick forested area, and sometimes you could say we were not even on a trail at all. We rounded a small hill which headed down  into a large valley, and across from us on the opposite hillside, in the direction we were heading to stood up a large Black Bear. To say the least we were very excited, and we immediately sped up to try to get a closer look at him before he ran away.  It was plain to see that what little trail we were trying to follow would take us right up the hillside where the Bear was heading, so off we went as fast as we could go.  When we reached the top of the hill, the Bear was already gone into the deep woods, and could no longer be seen.   We stopped our 4 wheelers, and sat there getting ready to talk about what we had just seen, when one of the guys from Florida said ""well look at this fella's"" Let me also add here that it had rained the day before we arrived so there were many places along the trails that still had water in the old 4 wheeler tracks, and lots of fresh mud.........  So right there in the middle of the trail was a set of very large foot prints,  heading along the trail, on up the mountain, but not along the path the Bear had just taken.  I knew immediately what I was seeing from the many Bigfoot tracks I have seen on web-sites, from books, and even TV programs, but I didn't know what to say, so I waited.   The other man from Florida said, ( you know what that looks like? ) no one said anything, so he went on and said  ( that's one of them Bigfoot prints ) I almost fell off my 4 wheeler, I said (do you really think so?)  he said (sure , if you hunt as much as we do back in Florida, its not unusual to see them on occasion)  I can't begin to tell you how relieved I was to hear them say this, as I have always been very discreet with my belief in Bigfoot's existence, and as a Pastor/Minister you have to be so careful around people.   Now for the real shocker..........   I looked at my friend ""Ricky"" and said (well Rick, what do you think?)  and he looked me straight in the eye and said, ( I know they exist I've seen one before )   I literally jumped off my 4 wheeler and said ( you got to be kidding me )  We then both learned that although we had been friends for all these years, we had never talked about Bigfoot to each other, and now I find out that he once saw one, needless to say I was blown away from this revelation.   I want to leave that story for another post, later.  some added info on this story...... ( there were a total of 4 tracks (2 left and 2 right footprints) , going in a straight line right up the middle of the trail.  Each print was around 4 to 5 inches wide, and at least 14 to 15 inches long, from toe to heel.   ( I want to add here that the prints gave the impression that they looked longer because of the up-hill climb, and the slippery mud)  but this is just my impression from first looking at the tracks. Each track had 1 Big Toe, and there were sometimes 3 other toe's, and on one track there was 4 toe's, or what looked like the slight imprint of a 4th toe.    The length of the stride was somewhere near 4 1/2  to 5 feet...... This is only a guess, because none of us had a ruler, or tape measure.

"OK, let me start by saying I have always been fascinated by ""Big Foot.""  I don't think it makes me biased because until recently I was always still skeptical but very curious. I recently had a sighting and was looking in the reports provided here to see if there had been many in KY.  I was shocked to see so many in KY and was completely floored when I saw a report not only in my same county but on the abandoned property behind my farm.  The report was from 1993 I think but our first sighting was in 2006. In 2006 my then 4yr old daughter told me that she saw Monkeys at the edge of my field as she was riding in my wifes car down our driveway.  She said There was a big one and a smaller one.  They both had red eyes and the bigger one looked like it was waving.  I asked her how big and she said the biggest one was a lot bigger than me (I'm 6'4"" 200lbs) and it was real hairy.  I dismissed it as a childs imagination but always kept it in mind because the description matched stories I had heard as a teenager about a big foot type creature in Lawrenceburg known as ""Howdy"" because he waves. Ive had her retell the story to friends and family over the years and it stays consistant but never much detail. I was actually jealous.  I thought, if she really did see something, why couldn't I have seen it too so I could know for sure, plus as I stated before, I was always curious.  I kept an extra eye out for a while but never saw anything and pretty much dismissed it. Modern Rifle season, November 2011.  I was deer hunting by myself on the same property (mine) that borders the abandoned ***** ******** mentioned in a previous report.  It was getting close to dusk and I was considering getting out of the deer stand soon when I saw something out of the corner of my eye.  I turned to look and  couldnt believe my eyes.  From left to right I watched 2 creatures, both larger than me and covered in long hair, running upright on 2 feet.  There was no mistake these were big foot(s).  One was very dark brown/almost black and the slightly smaller one was almost blonde.  More like coyote colored blonde.  They were both jogging with arms relaxed and looking behind them.  They ran within 25 yards right in front of me!  I honestly cant give much detail about the faces, they were looking behind them alot plus I was simply shocked and not looking for detail.  They covered ground quickly and were gone in less than 10 seconds.  They dissapeared into a clump of trees behind my pond.  I pulled my scope up but could only make out ""something' going through the woods once they passed.  I waited until almost dark and got down to look for fur or prints.  I couldnt find anything but it was cold, dark and I was shaking from the shock of seeing them and the cold combined.  I returned the next morning and found no sign.",Removed at witness' request.,Anderson County,Kentucky,Fall,Report 33187: Dual sighting in late afternoon by deer hunter in tree stand near Lawrenceburg,37.97699,-84.90234,11/15/2011,33187,Class A,dng8h18000,56.8,55.62,54.44,54.16,0.93,1,0.65,0.0348,1,rain,1011.58,Rain until evening.,2,8.95,190,3.5
"My late Grandparents owned a home outside of Scottsville, Kentucky for many years in Allen County.  The area has always been well-known for sightings of the ""monkey man"" as he is called there throughout this area of Kentucky (Monkey Man Hollow).  The first sightings began back in the old pioneer days.  This story is true because my late Grandmother, an honest woman and Christian, saw one of these ""bigfoot"" creatures on two seperate occasions both at night time.  I was there during one encounter she had as well.  This creature would come into their front yard at night and lean up or kneel down against a large beech tree in their front yard.  She described the creatures as standing tall and upright, and walking like a man.  Both creatures were covered with white, and somewhat curly, hair all over.  I thought they may be older ones of these creatures because of the white hair.  The creatures just got up and walked away on two feet just like a person would do back into the woods.  Also, a friend and neighbor who lived down the road from them saw a Sasquatch one time leaning against a fence post in his front yard across a road in broad daylight.  He has told this story to lots of people many times, and always the same way.  When his dogs gave chase to the creature, tall and upright like a man with brown hair all over, just leaped over the fence and walked away into the valley below. Although I haven't seen one of these creatures, I did hear screaming sounds like a woman would make one night when I stayed overnight with them.  It woke us all up.  Trust me, this eerie sound would make your hair stand on end, and this was no ordinary animal sound either.  They always told me that it was just that ""thing"" that lives in the woods.  Many people throughout the years have seen these creatures all across the Allen County area.  This story is absolutely true and accurate to the best of my ability.  These creatures are real!","A few miles outside of Scottsville, Kentucky taking the old Glasgow Road until you turn right onto Durham Springs Road.
