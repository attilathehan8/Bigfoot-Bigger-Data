# Bigfoot Bigger Data Project
### Project Description:

This GitHub repository contains datasets, Python code, shapefiles, and other pertinent files and documentation to empirically explore the relationship between binge drinking and observed Bigfoot sightings across the U.S. between 2002 and 2012. It was created to fulfill the requirements for a final group project for a graduate-level course entitled Data Science for Applied Economics taught by Dr. Jared Hutchins at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign for the Spring 2022 semester. This repository contains files that can be used to produce and analyze a panel dataset which contains records of Bigfoot sightings (and detailed characteristics of those sightings) as well as U.S. county-level binge drinking rates (by gender) during this ten-year period. The purpose of this project was to build a longitudinal dataset and perform several descriptive, text, geospatial, and statistical analyses to ultimately determine to what extent binge drinking rates impact the number of reported Bigfoot sightings.
### Repository Structure:

 - **Code**: includes the Python code file called "Bigfoot_Bigger_Data_Master.ipynb"
 - **Documents Needed to Run Code**: includes the datasets, jpg files, and shapefiles the above Python code references
 - **Write Up**: includes the final report for this project and its findings in a document called "Bigfoot_Write_Up.docx"
 
### Installation & Execution:

To utilize the files in this repository, please follow the subsequent steps: 
1. Clone this repository to your individual computer using this link: https://github.com/attilathehan8/Bigfoot-Bigger-Data.git
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook "Bigfoot_Bigger_Data_Master.ipynb" file from this repository which contains all the necessary Python code to: 1) create the final panel dataset and 2) perform the subsequent analyses
3. Update the file paths in this Jupyter Notebook file for each of the referenced datasets, jpg files, and shapefiles accordingly: "Bigfoot_Dataset.csv", "Drinking_Dataset.csv", "bigfootpic.jpg", and "us_counties_2017.shp"
4. Run this updated Jupyter Notebook file from the beginning (i.e., all necessary packages will be installed, the dataset will be constructed, and all appropriate analyses and visuals will be conducted and created, respectively)
